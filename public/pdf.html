                  In the 1930s, during America’s worst financial crises, the
                  administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt employed
                  photographers to document the plight of everyday folk in the
                  Great Depression in order to push forward with their New Deal
                  programs. Documentary photographers Dorothea Lange and Walker
                  Evans were prolific frontrunners of these efforts and their
                  extraordinary photographs continue to endure today. Their
                  artistic and documentary mastery and historical importance
                  provide key insight into a monumental turning point in
                  American history.

                  Dorothea Lange had an extraordinary life and career as a
                  prolific photographer. She worked for Arnold Genthe in his
                  portrait studio in New York and studied photography with
                  Clarence White at Columbia University. In 1918 she began to
                  travel around the world to make her living as a photographer.
                  She found herself stranded in San Francisco, so she opened a
                  photographic studio there. Paul Taylor, who would become her
                  second husband, hired her to document migratory workers in
                  California.

                  In 1935 she began to work for the Resettlement Administration,
                  later known as the Farm Security Administration (<a href="#dog1">fig. 1</a>). During this period, she made her most famous image,
                  <a href="#catalogue-1"><em>Human Erosion in California (Migrant Mother)</em></a>, of Native American Florence Owens Thompson and her children
                  in a pea-pickers’ camp. Other less famous subjects included
                  Japanese internment camps and scenes of workers in factories
                  during World War II. Lange became the first woman awarded a
                  Guggenheim fellowship, and she spent nearly ten years making
                  photo essays for <em>Life</em> and other magazines. She also
                  traveled extensively, making photo essays in Vietnam, Ireland,
                  Pakistan, India, and elsewhere.

                  Walker Evans began to photograph in the late 1920s, making
                  snapshots during a European trip. Upon his return to New York,
                  he published his first images in 1930. During the Great
                  Depression, Evans began to photograph for the Resettlement
                  Administration, later known as the Farm Security
                  Administration (FSA), documenting workers and architecture in
                  the Southeastern states (<a href="#dog2">fig. 2</a>). In 1936
                  he traveled with the writer James Agee to illustrate an
                  article on tenant farm families for <em>Fortune</em> magazine;
                  the book <em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em> came out of
                  this collaboration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout his career Evans contributed photographs to
                  numerous publications, including three devoted solely to his
                  work. In 1965 he left Fortune, where he had been a staff
                  photographer for twenty years, to become a professor of
                  photography and graphic design at Yale University. He remained
                  in the position until 1974, a year before his death.

                  When Evans was officially hired in October 1935 as an
                  Information Specialist by the Historical Section of the
                  Resettlement Administration, his duties were described as
                  follows: “Under the general supervision of the Chief of the
                  Historical Section with wide latitude for the exercise of
                  independent judgement and decision as Senior Information
                  Specialist to carry out special assignments in the field;
                  collect, compile and create photographic material to
                  illustrate factual and interpretive news releases and other
                  informational material upon all problems, progress and
                  activities of the Resettlement Administration.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Evans was to make liberal use of his right to exercise
                  “independent judgement” during his time with the RA, and he
                  perpetually resisted the idea that his purpose there was to
                  gather illustrations for the promotion of the RA’s (that is,
                  the federal government’s New Deal) programs. While considering
                  a position with the RA in the spring of 1935, he jotted down
                  those things he would require of his employer, including the
                  “guarantee of one-man performance,” and what he would provide,
                  adding that he should not be asked to do anything more in the
                  way of political propaganda: “[I] Mean never [to] make
                  photographic statements for the government or do photographic
                  chores for gov or anyone in gov, no matter how powerful—this
                  is pure record not propaganda. The value and, if you like,
                  even the propaganda value for the government lies in the
                  record itself which in the long run will prove an intelligent
                  and farsighted thing to have done. NO POLITICS whatever.”

                  Because his pictures had been issued by the agency with
                  policy-approved captions for the past three years, Evans felt
                  the need in 1938 to distance himself from that establishment,
                  as well as the world of commercial publishing, by prefacing
                  <em>American Photographs</em> with this statement: “The
                  responsibility for the selection of the pictures used in this
                  book has rested with the author, and the choice has been
                  determined by his opinion: therefore they are presented
                  without sponsorship or connection with the policies, aesthetic
                  or political, of any of the institutions, publications or
                  government agencies for which some of the work has been
                  done.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Stryker’s business was to provide informative images to the
                  mass media, and he and Evans would always disagree about the
                  most appropriate vehicle for the latter’s photographs, as well
                  as the definition of “documentary.” But when the photography
                  project of the RA began, the two men were able to agree on its
                  primary subject: American history as exemplified by life in
                  the average American town. Evans’s vision for documenting
                  American life had begun to form much earlier; a letter drafted
                  to his friend Ernestine Evans, an editor at J. B. Lippincott,
                  in February of 1934, makes clear his aspirations:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    What do I want to do? … I know now is the time for picture
                    books. An American city is the best, Pittsburgh better than
                    Washington. I know more about such a place. I would want to
                    visit several besides Pittsburgh before deciding. Something
                    perhaps smaller. Toledo, Ohio, maybe. Then I’m not sure a
                    book of photos should be identified locally. American city
                    is what I’m after… People, all classes, surrounded by
                    bunches of the new down-and-out. Automobiles and the
                    automobile landscape. Architecture, American urban taste,
                    commerce, small scale, large scale, the city street
                    atmosphere, the street smell, the hateful stuff, women’s
                    clubs, fake culture, bad education, religion in decay…<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The two men could find common ground in part due to the
                  widespread influence of the 1929 publication
                  <em>Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture</em> by
                  Robert and Helen Lynd, professors of sociology at Columbia and
                  Sarah Lawrence, respectively. A 550-page field investigation
                  by social anthropologists with subject headings including
                  “What Middletown does to get its living” and “The houses in
                  which Middletown lives,” this pioneering project attempted an
                  objective analysis of life in a small Midwestern American city
                  (Muncie, Indiana). The Lynds’ study was hailed as a very
                  accessible report that was most appealing because it made “no
                  attempt to prove anything” but simply recorded “what was
                  observed.” The Lynds introduced their topic by saying their
                  goal “was to study synchronously the interwoven trends that
                  are the life of a small American city. A typical city,
                  strictly speaking, does not exist, but the city studied was
                  selected a shaving many features in common to a wide group of
                  communities.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Lynd 1929, 3</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Lynd, Robert S., and Helen Merrell Lynd.

                  The “Outline Memorandum” that Evans prepared in October 1935,
                  probably at Stryker’s request, laying out plans for an
                  eight-week automobile trip through the Southeast, makes
                  reference to Middletown and presents thoughts similar to the
                  photographer’s musings of 1934:
                </p>
                <blockquote>

                  This document goes on to list antebellum plantation
                  architecture in Natchez, Mississippi; small rural French towns
                  in Teche Parish, Louisiana; industrial themes in Birmingham,
                  Alabama; and a cotton plantation in South Carolina, as
                  objectives of the proposed trip for gathering still
                  photography of a “general sociological nature.” In early 1936,
                  one of <em>Middletown’s</em> authors had a chance to directly
                  affect the RA’s Photography Section: Stryker showed Robert
                  Lynd, a former Columbia colleague, some RA pictures and asked
                  for his opinion while lunching with him in New York. The
                  result was a “shooting script” for “things which should be
                  photographed as American Background,” issued by Stryker to his
                  team of photographers. The script contains an extensive
                  listing of items like “People on and off the job,” “How do
                  people look?,” “The wall decoration in homes as an index to
                  the different income groups and their reactions,” and “A
                  photographic study of use of leisure time in various income
                  groups.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>

                  Once Evans was officially on staff, his first trip under
                  Stryker’s direction seems to have been an extended fall visit
                  to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where steel mills, workers’
                  housing, parading legionnaires, and elaborate gravestones (<a href="#fig-1">figs. 1</a>, <a href="#fig-2">2</a> and <a href="#fig-3">3</a>) were his
                  subjects. Between November 1935 and April 1936, Evans made two
                  lengthy road trips that would account for the bulk of his
                  entire production for the RA and many of the 169 mid-thirties
                  pictures that follow this essay. From November to mid-January,
                  here turned to industrial centers in Pennsylvania, finally
                  spending some time in Pittsburgh, and went on to Ohio,
                  Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana,
                  following to some extent the course outlined in the memorandum
                  above. In February 1936, he left again, with a completely
                  Southern itinerary that would take him through many small
                  cities, some of them renowned for ante-bellum architecture and
                  Civil War battles, in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama,
                  Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, and Virginia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the spring of 1936, Stryker approved a furlough for Evans
                  to work on a <em>Fortune</em> story with James Agee. This
                  leave for mid-July through mid-September allowed Evans to
                  return to the “middle south” with Agee to prepare “an article
                  on cotton tenantry in the United States, in the form of a
                  photographic and verbal record of the daily lives and
                  environment of an average white family of tenant farmers” (<a href="#fig-4">figs. 4</a>, <a href="#fig-5">5</a>, <a href="#fig-6">6</a> and
                  <a href="#fig-7">7</a>). (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Agee 1941, viii</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Agee, James, and Walker Evans.

                  <em>Fortune’s</em> art editor, the pictures Evans produced on
                  this job would become the property of the RA after the
                  magazine had run the finished essay in a fall issue.

                  Once Evans returned from this trip south, during which he and
                  Agee documented the lives of the Burroughs, Fields, and Tengle
                  families in Alabama (see
                  <a href="#catalogue-3"><em>Bud Fields with His Wife</em></a>
                  and <a href="#catalogue-4"><em>Burrough’s Family</em></a>), he spent September and October printing his pictures and
                  preparing presentations for both <em>Fortune</em> and
                  Stryker.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  Stryker again talked about a New England trip, on which he
                  planned to accompany the photographer, but it did not
                  materialize, and Evans was once more sent to the South, this
                  time to photograph the catastrophe of flooding in Arkansas and
                  Tennessee. An unusual and demanding assignment for Evans, this
                  trip of late January and February 1937 was made with another
                  RA photographer, Edwin Locke, and required that he spend
                  considerable time in the affected area, photographing the
                  flood victims and their temporary shelters.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This would be his last travel for the RA, an agency that was
                  absorbed into the Farm Security Administration at about this
                  time. Evans’s contributions to the RA’s documentation of
                  Depression-era America had essentially been obtained between
                  the summer of 1935 and the spring of 1936, a period of less
                  than a year. The Alabama pictures made while on leave to
                  <em>Fortune</em> would become his best-known photographs and,
                  ironically, those most closely identified with his work as a
                  New Deal photographer.

                  The events generated by the Museum of Modern Art in the fall
                  of 1938 could be viewed as the culmination of a highly
                  productive period made possible by the patronage of the
                  federal government. The sequences of images that appeared in
                  the exhibition and book of American Photo-graphs, though
                  composed of different selections and gleaned from a decade of
                  the photographer’s work, might just as appropriately have
                  appeared under the title of “Middletown.” In fact, Kirstein
                  refers to the Lynds’ <em>Middletown</em> in his
                  <em>American Photographs</em> essay, suggesting that, although
                  Evans’s work should not be considered merely “illustrative
                  accompaniment,” a study such as theirs “might have been more
                  effective had it also been plotted in visual terms.” (<cite class="quire-citation expandable"><span class="quire-citation__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false">Kirstein 1938, 196</span><span class="quire-citation__content" hidden="">Kirstein, Lincoln.

                  A closer look at two little-known RA images—one that appeared
                  in both exhibition formats and one that appeared only in the
                  book—provides a glimpse of how much the exhibitions and
                  publication differed and of the way in which Evans went about
                  editing his own work. Appearing almost in the very middle of
                  the New York installation of
                  <em>American Photographs</em> were two 1937 images of Arkansas
                  flood refugees. One of them—a young African American woman
                  asleep under a quilt in a heavy, metal-frame bed—is found in
                  an almost square Getty print bearing an incomplete MoMA loan
                  number. A second image of almost the same size—a person who
                  looks more like an African American man, partially con-sealed
                  behind a boldly patterned makeshift curtain—is also found at
                  the Getty, but this print, apparently of the same vintage,
                  does not possess a loan number or label. Both images have been
                  severely cropped from the original negative.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  Prints of the two images hung as pendants in the New York show
                  between a photograph of a poor Cuban family from 1933 and a
                  picture of the Tengle family in Hale County, Alabama, singing
                  hymns. The installation list for the circulating version of
                  <em>American Photographs</em> calls for these two images to
                  appear together, only this time toward the end of the show, in
                  group XV (of eighteen groupings specified), where they would
                  be part of a larger selection of seven pictures, including
                  three Alabama tenant farmer images, two Cuban pictures of
                  workingmen and women, and views of factories in Louisiana and
                  wooden stores in Mississippi.

                <p>
                  For the book, however, Evans chose a vertically oriented print
                  from another negative of the sleeping woman mentioned above.
                  This image (<a href="#fig-8">figs. 8</a>), which might seem
                  more invasive than intimate, is even more startling and
                  unorthodox than the first. It presents the weary flood victim
                  at bedside level, awake but nestled under the quilt. Below her
                  on the floor of the old cotton warehouse that is supplying
                  emergency shelter are a few items of clothing and a bedpan.
                  Occurring at almost the exact center of the book—that is, as
                  plate forty-four in a sequence of eighty-seven images—it falls
                  between a van Gogh-like interior entitled
                  <em>Hudson Street Boarding House Detail, New York</em> and a
                  portrait of three working-class neighbors passing the time
                  together in <em>People in Summer, New York State Town</em>. As
                  comparative material from this winter of 1937 Arkansas
                  assignment, three other prints in the Getty collection depict
                  African American women displaced by the flood and huddled in
                  or near a bed due to cold and illness. Like the two images
                  chosen for the MoMA show, these three reflect substantial
                  cropping of the negatives in an effort to close in on a single
                  figure and eliminate the barn like interior of this
                  uncomfortable temporary home.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  Always after portraits of “the anonymous people” of
                  Middletown, Evans seems to have taken full advantage of the
                  unusual vulnerability of these residents of Forrest City,
                  Arkansas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Evans had company on this RA assignment, which must have been
                  one of the hardest emotionally as well as technically of his
                  career. The report submitted to Stryker by his more
                  communicative colleague, Edwin Locke, gives an immediate
                  picture of the conditions the two men found and the way they
                  attempted to record them. It also con-firms Evans’s
                  perfectionist nature, his persistent determination to get the
                  right picture, and the reasons why Roy Stryker, like Tom
                  Mabry, valued his work so highly. The handwritten letter on
                  hotel stationery reads in part:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    My God, we are tired tonight! Got up at 6 this morning,
                    worked until 5:30 PM, made the 6:20 PM train back to
                    Memphis, having covered the refugee camps as well as we
                    could without flashes. And now a word about the camps: L
                    White camp (about 2 miles away from Negro camp—we covered
                    this twice on foot with equipment): well run, adequate tent
                    space, good (regular army) food. A detachment of soldiers
                    from Fort Leavenworth are running the outfit along with the
                    CCC… The Negro camp: Overcrowded. There are many more
                    negroes than whites affected by flood in this area. Found 11
                    in one tent. They are not “happy-go-lucky” about it, but
                    dazed, apathetic, and hopeless. There is a good deal of
                    illness: excruciating coughs, pneumonia and influenza cases
                    laying in a dark cotton warehouse. I shot in there with the
                    Leica, but Walker said it was too dark. He bought
                    photoflashes and shot with the 4x5, but is afraid that the
                    exposures were wrong. He will undoubtedly want to go
                    back…<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Evans and Stryker parted ways, mostly because of the
                  bureaucratic requirements that Stryker adhered to. Working
                  under difficult conditions was certainly not some-thing the
                  photographer shied away from, particularly when he was after
                  the archetypal portrait of “Everyman” that he treasured. In
                  pursuit of this goal, for his next major series Evans would
                  contrive to photograph only by remote shutter release while
                  riding the New York subway in winter.

                      The first publication of this renowned image occurred on
                      March 11, 1936, on the third day that the San Francisco
                      News ran a story about the pea pickers’ camp at Nipomo. It
                      was also featured as a full-page reproduction in September
                      1936 issue of <em>Survey Graphic</em>, titled
                      “Draggin’-Around People” and captioned “A blighted pea
                      crop in California in 1935 left the pickers without work.
                      This family sold their tent to get food.” Also in this
                      issue was an article by Taylor entitled “From the Group
                      Up.” His report on demonstration projects of the New
                      Deal’s Resettlement Administration in Arizona, Utah, New
                      Mexico, and California was illustrated with four more
                      picture by Lange.

                    <p>
                      Since it was first published, this composition, best known
                      as <em>Migrant Mother</em>, has come to represent not only
                      the pictorial archive created by the RA/FSA during the
                      1930s but also the Great Depression itself. Posters and
                      other publicity of later activists fighting racial,
                      economic, and political oppression have borrowed from
                      Lange’s icon of the time. The handsome, androgynous face,
                      the pose of stoic anxiety, and the encumbrance of three
                      young children proved to be universal attributes. With
                      Lange’s artistry, Owens took on the timeless quality of
                      Eugéne Delacroix’s strong female rebel (<em>Liberty Leading the People</em>), Jean-François Millet’s peasant woman (the agrarian
                      ideal), Honoré Daumier’s laundresses (the working woman)
                      and Käthe Kollwitz’s proletarian woman warrior (one of the
                      mothers leading her <em>Peasants’ War</em>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Owens, although she became famous, did not enjoy, even
                      momentarily, the life of a celebrity. She had three more
                      children and kept moving with her family, following the
                      California crops. She did become involved in efforts to
                      organize farm labor and would sometimes serve as the straw
                      boss, one who negotiates wages for migrants as the picking
                      season begins. She was still working in the fields at age
                      fifty before finally marrying again (to George Thompson)
                      and settling into a stable life in Modesto, California.

                      This print, made in Washington, D.C, darkroom of the
                      resettlement Administration and sent to the New York Times
                      for publication in August 1936, has pencil inscriptions in
                      several different hands on the verso. Among them are
                      various captions (“Pea pickers in Calif. ‘Mam [sic], I’ve
                      picked pea from Calipatria to Ukiah’” and “Members of the
                      roving army of fruit pickers”); date stamps; the RA stamp
                      (“Kindly use the following credit line: RESETTLEMENT
                      ADMINISTRATION PHOTOGRAPH by Lange”); and the picture
                      editor’s directions (“single x 2 col, 4 x 3 ¾, tonight”).
                      The Times art department worked on the picture itself,
                      applying white, gray, and black pigment to make the
                      figures appear more three-dimensional and to set them off
                      from their auto/home and the grassy foreground. Crop marks
                      provide further aids to the printers responsible for
                      making zinc printing plates and laying out the feature.

                      The truck or car modified to act as a home for migrants
                      traveling from job to job was a common sight on California
                      highways and at roadside camps in the 1930s. In this case,
                      a truck has been adapted to provide sleeping
                      quarters—complete with sunroof—and other household
                      requirements. The couple has obviously covered a lot of
                      miles, as the man is quoted as saying, picking peas from
                      the Imperial Valley of Southern California to northern
                      Ukiah Valley of Mendocino County. Lange found them in
                      Nipomo, midway up the coast and midway through another
                      season that would cause them to traverse the length of the
                      huge state.

                    <p>
                      John Steinbeck describes the important of the truck to the
                      Oklahoma farmer of The Grapes of Wrath (1939) as they load
                      theirs to begin migrant life:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        The house was dead, and the fields were dead; but this
                        truck was the active thing, the living principle. The
                        ancient Hudson, with bent and scarred radiator
                        screen,…this was the new hearth, the living center of
                        the family.

                      From mid-July to mid-September 1936, Evans took a leave
                      from his position as an information specialist for the
                      Historical Section of the Resettlement Administration to
                      work with the writer James Agee on an assignment for
                      <em>Fortune</em> magazine. They traveled to the Deep South
                      to prepare an article on tenant cotton farming. In Alabama
                      they documented the lives of farmers, including the Fields
                      family. Evans found in this average American household the
                      archetypal portrait of the everyman that he treasured. The
                      straight-forward style of this portrait emphasizes the
                      family’s hard life as much as their pride.

                      <em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em>, with text by James
                      Agee and photographs by Walker Evans, was published in
                      1941. The book focused on three tenant cotton-farming
                      families living in Hale County, Alabama, during the
                      Depression. Agee invented the name “Gudger” for the book;
                      this family’s real name was Burroughs. The Burroughses
                      hosted Agee and Evans for nearly a month, and this
                      photograph was made at George Burroughs’s request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The family sits and stands against the side of their
                      house, dressed in their best clothing, posing for a family
                      photograph. George Burroughs, standing at the center, does
                      not smile; rather, he looks proud and strong, his arms
                      extended across the shoulders of his wife and eldest
                      daughter on either side of him. The photograph shows the
                      Burroughses as they wished to be seen and differs from
                      other photographs of them that express Evans’s view,
                      portraying their situation more bleakly.
