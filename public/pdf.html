                  In 2019 Yale University, with the support of the Getty
                  Foundation, held an international conference, where nearly
                  four hundred attendees from more than twenty countries
                  gathered to discuss a vital topic: how best to conserve
                  paintings on canvas. It was the first major symposium on the
                  subject since 1974, when wax-resin and glue-paste lining
                  reigned as the predominant conservation techniques. Over the
                  past fifty years, such methods, which were often destructive
                  to artworks, have become less widely used in favor of more
                  minimalist approaches to intervention. More recent decades
                  have witnessed the reevaluation of traditional practices as
                  well as focused research supporting significant new
                  methodologies, procedures, and synthetic materials for the
                  care and conservation of paintings on fabric supports.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Conserving Canvas compiles the proceedings of the conference,
                  presenting a wide array of papers and posters that provide
                  important global perspectives on the history, current state,
                  and future needs of the field. Featuring an expansive glossary
                  of terms that will be an invaluable resource for conservators
                  and other practitioners, this publication promises to become a
                  standard reference for the international conservation
                  community.

                  We are delighted to present the proceedings of the October
                  2019 international symposium <em>Conserving Canvas</em>. Like
                  the Getty Foundation initiative carrying the same name, the
                  symposium focused on the structural care and conservation of
                  paintings on fabric supports. Organized by the Institute for
                  the Preservation of Cultural Heritage at Yale University, and
                  with support from the Yale University Art Gallery and Yale
                  Center for British Art, this momentous event gathered no less
                  than 370 conservators and conservation scientists from around
                  the globe on Yale’s campus in 2019 to discuss what was once a
                  heated topic in the field. Here we are referring to the method
                  of wax-resin lining that previously dominated in the field and
                  was heavily criticized and largely abandoned after the
                  legendary 1974 conference held at the National Maritime Museum
                  in Greenwich, England. At that conference, conservators
                  ushered in an era of new approaches, alternative procedures,
                  and novel synthetic materials. The 2019 Yale conference was
                  the first major international gathering on the subject since
                  1974, allowing specialists to look back on more than
                  forty-five years of practice and take stock of the current
                  state of the field. Thanks to the symposium organizers,
                  professionals from India to Argentina, from Scotland to South
                  Africa met each other and exchanged ideas, setting new
                  standards for international inclusion in the field. We extend
                  special recognition and thanks to the organizers and advisors
                  who worked hard to make this experience so valuable for so
                  many: Ian McClure, Elizabeth Williams, Cynthia Schwarz, Mikkel
                  Scharf, Christina Young, Alan Phenix, and Jim Coddington.

                  The care and conservation of paintings on canvas is an ongoing
                  concern for museums around the world. Ever since the 1974
                  Greenwich conference, many conservators have shied away from
                  structural repairs perceived as being too invasive. In many
                  cases this led to unintended consequences, with new
                  generations of conservators possessing little to no practical
                  experience with structural treatments. To address this
                  knowledge gap, the Getty Foundation in 2018 launched the
                  Conserving Canvas grant initiative, which to date has
                  supported twenty-six projects involving conservators and other
                  specialists from more than three dozen countries. The
                  Conserving Canvas initiative is ensuring that conservators
                  remain fully informed about how to preserve these important
                  works of art through support for training activities,
                  scientific research, and information sharing.&nbsp;The Yale
                  conference was a crucial launching pad for this work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As you will read in this volume, presenters at the
                  <em>Conserving Canvas</em> symposium addressed historical
                  approaches to the treatment of canvas paintings; highlighted
                  current methods, materials, and research; and pointed to the
                  growing challenges associated with the structural conservation
                  of modern and contemporary works. While the record indicates
                  that the atmosphere at the Greenwich conference was quite
                  contentious, the Yale conference could not have been more
                  collegial. Productive dialogue and discussion proved how much
                  the field has developed in the last four decades, and the
                  energy and enthusiasm generated among participants was
                  positively electric. Over four days the presenters shared
                  diverse views and approaches, which prompted frank and
                  in-depth conversations. The forty papers and twenty-three
                  posters presented in these proceedings reflect that quality
                  and diversity.

                  The symposium held at Yale in October 2019 grew out of the
                  Getty Foundation’s Conserving Canvas initiative, which,
                  through a combination of practical workshops, publications and
                  research support, and expert meetings, aims to evaluate and
                  foster the structural treatment of paintings on canvas (<a href="#fig-0-1"><strong>fig. 0.1</strong></a>). The symposium was planned with the 1974 Greenwich
                  Conference on Comparative Lining Techniques,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  the last international conference to be held on this subject,
                  very much in mind. In 1974, conservators from institutions and
                  in private practice demonstrated a wide range of techniques,
                  both innovative and traditional, and in doing so raised some
                  fundamental questions that are still central to our thinking
                  and decision-making process in planning structural treatments.
                  In the forty-five years since, however, the options for lining
                  and alternatives to lining have expanded. The new options are
                  drawn from a variety of sources: advances in the materials
                  industry, with the production of synthetic adhesives and
                  textiles and the introduction of nanotechnology; new research
                  into the mechanical behavior of laminate structures; and the
                  resourcefulness of conservators who approach their work with
                  innovation. Concerns at the forefront of the field in 2019
                  also included environmental sustainability and a heightened
                  awareness of the benefits of a global perspective on painting
                  conservation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The timeliness of the Conserving Canvas initiative and the
                  conference is clear. In the planning stages, it was thought
                  the sessions would be held on Yale’s West Campus, where the
                  conservation studios and Institute for Preservation of
                  Cultural Heritage are located. High demand quickly dictated a
                  move to the more spacious auditorium at the Yale Art Gallery,
                  which filled to capacity. The auditorium was filled with over
                  370 attendees from more than twenty-five countries, likely the
                  largest gathering of painting conservators ever convened (<a href="#fig-0-2"><strong>fig. 0.2</strong></a>). This interest in the topic was also mirrored in the
                  international response in papers presented by conservators who
                  represented more than twenty countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The impact of the postprints of the 1974 conference was even
                  greater than the conference itself, as they not only presented
                  to a much wider audience the different approaches introduced
                  there, but also questioned previously held assumptions. While
                  the conference provided the opportunity for conservators to
                  compare lining techniques, with a focus on practical
                  workshops, the necessity of lining as a preservation measure
                  was ultimately called into question. For many, the most
                  perceptive and significant paper was the opening presentation
                  by Westby Percival-Prescott, “The Lining Cycle,” in which he
                  demonstrated how artists’ techniques of a certain period would
                  affect the response of those paintings to particular lining
                  practices at the time, usually evident many years later when
                  those paintings were deemed to require lining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Percival-Prescott’s paper, after reviewing different lining
                  techniques, called for research into methods that might
                  prevent the necessity of lining (see
                  <a href="#paper-42">Stoner</a> in this publication). In effect,
                  a call for historical research and a minimalist approach were
                  made.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With this context in mind, the call for papers for this
                  symposium made in September 2018 announced, “The symposium
                  will address historical approaches to and theories of the
                  structural conservation of canvas paintings; current methods,
                  materials and research, both practical and scientific; and the
                  challenges facing the structural conservation of modern and
                  contemporary works.” This reflected, in the view of the
                  Advisory Committee,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  developments and concerns in the structural treatment of works
                  on canvas today. The response to the call for papers was much
                  larger than expected and the proposals submitted guided the
                  committee to choose the sections laid out in these postprints.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While Percival-Prescott’s paper was unique in providing an
                  historical review in 1974, in the 2019 symposium historical
                  research played a very significant role. The recent research
                  into contemporary documentary sources, discussed in
                  contributions by <a href="#paper-5">Angela Cerasuolo</a>,
                  <a href="#paper-10">Matteo Rossi-Doria</a>, and
                  <a href="#paper-18">Ana Calvo et al.</a>, attest to considered
                  practices dating back to the eighteenth century and before. In
                  many cases written sources can be linked to surviving
                  treatments, often demonstrating the unexpected longevity of
                  linings carried out with natural materials. A strong case is
                  made for the use of natural materials—both for their low
                  toxicity and their performance over time. On the other hand,
                  assumptions about the stabilizing hydrophobic attributes of
                  wax-resin treatments were called into question by new
                  research, as can be seen, for example, in the work by [Emilie
                  Froment](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/paper-46).
                  A divide on seeking flexibility (as in mist lining) or
                  rigidity (as demonstrated in
                  <a href="#paper-22">Lynne Harrison’s paper</a>) in a lining or
                  lining system emerged, which also represented the trends of
                  research on lining procedures, and the mechanical behavior of
                  the composite structure of paintings since the Greenwich
                  Lining Conference. The fact that many of the practical and
                  philosophical divides in structural practices still fall along
                  geographic lines speaks to the sustained, deep roots in
                  historic treatment practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another theme that emerged at the conference was an emphasis
                  on the history and treatment of collections as a whole, as
                  well as forward-looking preventive care of collections. Here,
                  too, the role of past and ongoing research was evident,
                  although perhaps not always carried over into practice.
                  Increased levels of documentation also allow for the
                  examination and analysis of more data, mostly focused on
                  collections and their treatment histories. The greater
                  attention to documentation has enabled reviews of
                  institutional practice—which, when the data is extensive
                  enough, reveals trends, as evidenced in the contributions by
                  <a href="#paper-34">Nicola Costaras</a> and [Lauren Bradley and
                  Josh
                  Summer](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/paper-42).
                  A series of case studies covered the treatment of works large
                  and small and highlighted the significant attention paid to
                  local interventions, which demonstrate conservation’s
                  continuing ability to adopt and adapt existing techniques and
                  equipment from other fields, such as textile conservation,
                  imaging technology, and mechanical engineering. Papers
                  included research using samples of significant natural aging
                  and showed the ongoing embrace of new materials—both from
                  other fields and those specifically developed for
                  conservation. The audience was introduced to
                  <a href="#paper-30">Flock and Demuth’s “Winnie”</a> for the
                  application of glue in tear mends, for example, as well as the
                  adhesive meshes developed by
                  <a href="#paper-28">Mona Konietzny et al.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Threaded through all of these topics at the conference was the
                  ongoing question of definitions, of finding a common
                  vocabulary to describe—with as much precision and accuracy as
                  possible—what conservators see and do. This is especially
                  critical in order to exchange philosophies, methodologies, and
                  techniques with an international community that has grown out
                  of a variety of historic traditions and practice in vastly
                  different climates. To that end, we have included a
                  <a href="#glossary">glossary</a> based on the one published in
                  the 1974 preprints. Terms no longer in use have been deleted
                  and terms that have become current have been added. It is our
                  hope that this revised glossary reflects developments since
                  1974 while also attempting to define terms that can be used
                  universally. Finally, around the margins, but clearly moving
                  to a central position, is the question of sustainability, in
                  all its various forms. Indeed here is a term in need of
                  definition and common understanding.

                  One part of the conference that is not available to the reader
                  of these proceedings is the day devoted to practical
                  demonstrations—“sandbox sessions” that provided the
                  opportunity for experiential learning (<a href="#fig-0-3"><strong>fig. 0.3</strong></a>). Expert contributors led sessions on historic
                  reconstructions, innovative tools and equipment, hands-on
                  mechanical demonstrations, and localized tear mending. It is
                  the continued refinement of established practice, as well as
                  development of new, more effective practices, that these
                  sessions represent, and to which we believe these proceedings
                  will be an ongoing contribution.

                  None of this would have been possible without the support of a
                  large network of our generous, capable colleagues. First,
                  thanks are owed to the rest of the symposium Advisory
                  Committee: Alan Phenix, Mikkel Scharff, Anton Wilmering, and
                  Christina Young. At Getty, thanks also to Joan Weinstein and
                  Allison Reilly. At Yale, thanks go out to Stephanie Wiles;
                  Henry J. Heinz II, director of the Yale University Art
                  Gallery; and Courtney Martin, director of the Yale Center for
                  British Art, for their support, contribution of space and
                  resources to the symposium, and hospitality shown to the
                  participants. The conference would not have been possible
                  without the ongoing efforts of Laurie Batza, Beth Bolen, and
                  Elizabeth Williams at the Yale Institute for the Preservation
                  of Cultural Heritage. Also thanks to the Yale Conferences and
                  Events staff, especially Shannon LeGault, who arranged two
                  meals a day and warm welcomes for our 370 participants. The
                  Avangrid Foundation provided critical funding support for
                  presenters and attendees from Spain, and our special thanks go
                  to Nicole Licata Grant. The program books were designed by
                  Stephanie Bedoya with the assistance of Yale University Art
                  Gallery designer Chris Sleboda, who also designed the tote
                  bags for the participants. Advertising support from Willard
                  Conservation Products, Everett Fine Art, and Getty
                  Publications made the program books possible. At the Yale
                  University Art Gallery, thanks are owed to Molleen Theodore,
                  Liz Harnett, Mark Paturzo, and Roksana Filipowska. Many Yale
                  University conservators, conservation fellows, and interns
                  contributed to the success of the symposium, from hosting
                  guests and providing directions to assisting in sandbox
                  sessions and hanging posters, and to too many other supportive
                  roles to mention. Our deep thanks for this to Irma Passeri,
                  Kelsey Wingel, Mark Aronson, Jessica David, Anne Gunnison,
                  Olav Bjornerud, and Beth Godcher. We hope that this
                  publication will be of great value to the international
                  conservation community for years to come.

                        Many of these effects changed the appearance of the
                        paintings. These changes to the structure, topography,
                        and other attributes of the painting have been described
                        in various ways in the conservation literature. Most
                        importantly, though, a consensus emerged that these
                        changes compromised the aesthetic integrity of the
                        painting, bringing aesthetic discussions of the surfaces
                        of paintings to the fore as well as discussion of
                        technical matters.

                  In the latter part of the twentieth century, conservators
                  questioned the practice of lining paintings on canvas. This
                  inspired fundamental scientific studies of the structure,
                  material, and aging of paintings. The implications of
                  mechanical and chemical aging can now be better predicted.
                  This knowledge has provided conservators with a wide choice of
                  alternative treatments, and it supports the concept of
                  collections care.

                  Structural Conservation
                </h2>
                <p>
                  By addressing the structure of a painting, we are forced to
                  consider not only the image intended by the artist but also
                  the artwork’s physical nature and history. A stretched canvas
                  is a subtle and delicate construction devised for both
                  stability and lightness, but if the structure is damaged or
                  failing, this creates risks for both the appearance and
                  purpose of a painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As any artifact ages and deteriorates, it eventually reaches a
                  point when its appearance and functions are judged no longer
                  acceptable. Some of these changes demand action in order to
                  preserve the artifact’s use and prevent further decay. Some
                  changes are not reversible—for instance, cracks, which
                  indicate fragility and may also cause a disturbing
                  interference with an image. Yet, for a painting, cracks are
                  also viewed as a sign of authenticity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Structural conservation of a canvas painting can be a more
                  profound intervention than cleaning or varnish removal, and
                  each intervention presents fundamental aesthetic challenges
                  for the paint surface and ethical doubts for the concept of
                  reversibility. A structural treatment may be applied to an
                  entire painting, perhaps in a single rapid operation. Like
                  other aspects of conservation, such a treatment requires
                  considerable judgment and skill, and success is often judged
                  by its invisibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fifty years ago, a traditional lining method was considered a
                  normal component of any conservation treatment. The lining
                  used was defined by the choice of adhesive, and these
                  materials had a surprisingly wide range of properties, from
                  water based to water repellent. The goal of lining was to turn
                  a fragile canvas painting into one that was much more
                  resilient, but the means and the outcome were not well
                  defined. The dangers in lining were recognized, however, and
                  it was normally carried out by skilled and experienced
                  professionals. But attempts were also made to automate and
                  deskill the process by using hot tables and vacuum pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the student, there was little published information except
                  for some early discussions on reservations about glue lining,
                  the justification for introducing wax-resin adhesives, and
                  designs for hot tables ([[Ruhemann 1953]]; [[Straub and
                  Rees-Jones 1955]]). From this background, W. Percival-Prescott
                  conceived the Conference on Comparative Lining Techniques,
                  held in Greenwich (London) in 1974. This ambitious project
                  brought together experts from various backgrounds, but it
                  succeeded in uncovering much confusion of purpose and also a
                  genuine desire to improve the situation ([[Percival-Prescott
                  2003b]]). Traditional methods were described by practitioners,
                  and several research projects investigating alternative
                  adhesives and lining methods were presented. A wide variety of
                  conservation aims emerged, from restoring the original
                  appearance of a painting to accepting its existing condition
                  ([[Mehra 2003]]). For the first time, the advantages and
                  disadvantages of all materials and methods were openly
                  debated, including wax lining methods ([[Berger and Zeliger
                  2003]]; [[Cummings and Hedley 2003]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  During a period when lining was widely, uncritically accepted,
                  most practitioners had a limited range of experience and had
                  honed their skills in a narrow lining specialty based on one
                  specific adhesive. The establishment of conservation training
                  courses with academic aspirations has now largely replaced the
                  former apprenticeship training, which passed on the strengths
                  and skills of existing practices but had no mechanism to
                  compare or improve on them. Formal training has provided
                  impetus for conservation science, and the study of
                  conservation methods has influenced the materials and practice
                  of conservators, and even some artists.

                  After Greenwich, it was clear that an understanding of the
                  structure and mechanisms of stretched canvas paintings was
                  needed. This has since been achieved by a number of
                  researchers, beginning with Marion Mecklenburg and his
                  systematic studies that provided measurements of painting
                  materials under tension and in different RH conditions,
                  identifying the high tension in glue films and grounds at low
                  humidity. Measurements of breaking strains of oil paint films
                  led to an explanation of the observed cracking of canvas
                  paintings ([<strong>fig. 1.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-1)).

                  The response of paintings to moisture had been a particular
                  concern since the nineteenth century. Mecklenburg’s plot of
                  tension against RH for all the materials on a stretched and
                  primed canvas was a major advance ([[Mecklenburg 1982]];
                  [[Mecklenburg and Tumosa 1991a]]). Gerry Hedley explained the
                  mechanism of canvas shrinking when exposed to water or RH
                  approaching 100%. He also saw the effect of initial weave
                  crimp transfer from warp to weft ([[Hedley 1993]]; [[Hedley
                  and Odlyha 1993]]). The differing influence of pigments on the
                  drying (curing) of linseed oil explained why the application
                  of moisture and pressure is not enough to flatten most mature
                  lead white paints. Temperature response of paintings was also
                  investigated ([[Michalski 1991]]). Cracking of otherwise
                  flexible acrylic paintings at extremely low temperatures was
                  at first surprising. The concept of glass transition
                  temperature (Tg) clarified why familiar flexible materials
                  became brittle at these low temperatures.

                  Long-term mechanical behavior, such as relaxation and creep,
                  have also been measured, providing useful predictions of
                  future behavior. It took sixteen years to collect the data
                  shown in [<strong>fig. 1.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-2)
                  at the Canadian Conservation Institute, which shows the
                  relaxation (loss of tension) of stretched canvas paintings and
                  linings over that period of time, plotted on a logarithmic
                  time axis. Such data is critical when deciding on the best
                  choice of adhesive and lining material.

                  The use of biaxial stretching, first proposed by Berger
                  ({Berger and Russell 2000}), and electronic speckle pattern
                  interferometry (ESPI) for strain measurement ([<strong>fig. 1.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-3))
                  enabled Young and Hibberd to look in further detail at
                  conservation issues and lining practice, such as the strain
                  associated with stretcher attachments ([[Young and Hibberd
                  1999]]; [[Young and Hibberd 2000]]). The complex structure of
                  stretched canvas is now understood in sufficient detail to
                  consider computer modeling of the mechanical properties of
                  both paintings and linings. It also offers the opportunity to
                  study in more detail the effects of minimal treatments on more
                  contemporary paintings ([[Hagan et al. 2007]]; [[Hagan et al.
                  2011]]). Temporary solutions and physical protection may prove
                  to be our best options, but many have not yet been fully
                  assessed objectively.

                <p>
                  Transferring research results into conservation practice on
                  historic objects involves special problems. Understanding
                  materials in a pristine state is not enough to predict the
                  behavior of deteriorated old paintings ([[Ackroyd 2002]];
                  [[Hackney 2004b]]; [[Phenix 1995]]; [[Reeve 1984]]; [[Scharff
                  2012]]). Since an assessment of physical condition and
                  appropriate treatment requires such knowledge, measuring slow
                  processes, such as “natural” aging, is increasingly necessary
                  in order to make reliable long-term decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Progress in devising and applying new conservation treatments
                  is made difficult because at some stage practical experience
                  can be gained only by working directly on unique and valuable
                  original aged material ([<strong>fig. 1.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-4)).
                  It might be argued that this amounts to carrying out
                  scientific experiments lacking a control. As a consequence, we
                  can choose our treatment method but cannot be sure it was the
                  best of several possible options.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the UK, original nineteenth-century loose linings have
                  provided a limited source of acceptable experimental material,
                  but such material has still not been replicated reliably in
                  all its aspects by artificial aging methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the conservator concerned with historic paintings, it is
                  important to be aware of artists’ changing methods, materials,
                  and intentions. There is much detail, accumulated from the
                  examination of examples of painting practice, to inform the
                  conservator of the likely behavior of a specific painting to
                  be treated. For the period from the latter part of the
                  nineteenth century until the present, artists were less bound
                  by academy controls; their aims became more adventurous, and
                  their materials and methods expanded. As paintings from this
                  period increasingly demand attention and treatment, the
                  conservator is presented with a variety of interesting new
                  problems and conflicts, many of which have already contributed
                  to modified conservation practice for works on canvas,
                  currently leading to a more preventive approach. The demands
                  of much recently created art provide a challenge that requires
                  radical solutions, and they are pointing to new directions in
                  conservation of both contemporary and traditional art
                  ([[Heiber 2003]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some developments of lining processes using new materials,
                  such as sailcloth fabric ([[Hedley and Villers 1982]]) and
                  Beva 371 adhesive ([[Berger 1975]]), have so far survived the
                  test of time. Exploring the properties and stability of
                  possible alternative conservation structural materials is a
                  major undertaking, made more difficult by the risk that
                  material manufacturers may discontinue their supply. Economics
                  also conspire to deter time-consuming structural treatments.
                  As a consequence, for many contemporary paintings, restoration
                  often challenges existing experience and costs much more than
                  preventing damage ([<strong>fig. 1.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-5)).

                <p>
                  Given the many unavoidable problems encountered in
                  conservation treatments, protecting canvases from physical and
                  chemical deterioration is now considered a priority in many
                  museums. For the conservator, it has always been difficult to
                  predict the range of conditions to which a painting has been
                  and could be exposed. The environment that a specific painting
                  is likely to encounter remains uncertain, even within museums.
                  Increasingly, we ask what are the true risks for paintings on
                  canvas and how should we decide when intervention is
                  necessary?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Improvements in the environment of modern museums (controlled
                  and filtered air conditioning, UV filtration); careful
                  handling and operating procedures; and protection during
                  transport and handling have all contributed to more reliable
                  conditions. Defining exact relative humidity/temperature
                  (RH/T) conditions is virtually impossible, but the absence of
                  identifiable damage that can be directly attributed to current
                  museum conditions is a positive indicator. However, more
                  recently, an open-ended commitment to long-term protection by
                  air-conditioning has been challenged as expensive and
                  unsustainable in energy terms.

                  In the past, the risks of travel were unpredictable and
                  thought to be large. Conservators were therefore obliged to
                  reinforce a painting’s structure to the best of their powers.
                  With increasing loan and exhibition programs and major
                  blockbuster exhibitions, this has become an international
                  problem. The transport environment has now been examined in
                  terms of shock, vibration, moisture content, and temperature
                  along with their consequences for paintings in transit.
                  Criteria for behavior and designs for packing cases to
                  minimize exposure to risks have become established. An
                  interesting observation from the Art in Transit research group
                  was that, by using reliable methods and tight procedures,
                  transport risks could be reduced below those of handling
                  within a museum ([[Mecklenburg 1991]]).

                  By introducing consistent procedures for the physical
                  protection of works of art, it is easier to avoid much
                  accidental damage and unnecessary early deterioration.
                  Successful collections care procedures have together made the
                  idea that lining is a requirement much less persuasive and
                  forced us to be more precise about its purpose.

                  For the long-term survival of paintings, the less dramatic yet
                  equally important chemical degradation of canvas, size,
                  ground, and paint needs to be considered. However, the exact
                  condition of aged canvases and their continuing rate of decay
                  cannot be known in sufficient detail and are not readily
                  captured in most risk analysis, which is currently concerned
                  with shorter term, mainly physical activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The slow reactions of oxidation and hydrolysis that take place
                  in degrading cellulose and oil paint are the main reasons that
                  painting materials become fragile. What were originally stable
                  structures no longer perform their design function, and
                  physical damage often follows. Air pollution and light
                  contribute to this deterioration, involving chemical
                  interactions between canvas and its immediate environment.
                  They play a subtle, perhaps unstoppable, role in aging.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the period between 1900 and 1960, air pollution was at its
                  worst in many countries. Most museums were not
                  air-conditioned, and until about 1990 concentrations of
                  particulates and the strong acidic gas sulfur dioxide remained
                  unacceptably high. In the last hundred years or so, exposed
                  canvas has adsorbed sulfur dioxide from air pollution; the
                  sulfur dioxide then reacts with the cellulose in the canvas.
                  The products are not volatile and remain in the canvas,
                  facilitating hydrolysis reactions. All acidity, whether from
                  external and internal pollution or simply from oxidation,
                  cause measurable weakening and embrittlement of the canvas
                  ([<strong>fig. 1.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-6)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Efflorescence can occur on the surface of oil paintings,
                  especially unvarnished ones, and sometimes, on glazed works,
                  it is transferred onto the glass. This deposit has been
                  analyzed as fatty acids ([[Williams 1989]]), and these fatty
                  acids must have been released from the oil paint. The
                  hydrolysis of oils is well known, and migration of its
                  reaction products within dried oil paint films explains
                  efflorescence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There has been a major advance in understanding the
                  degradation of oil paint and how it changes the paint’s
                  optical performance and our perception of a painted image
                  ([[Boon, Van der Weerd, and Keune 2002]]; [[Keune 2005]]). We
                  are all familiar with the increase in transparency of oil
                  paintings and grounds. The impregnation and lining of
                  paintings with thin grounds can cause increases in
                  transparency, especially when wax resin has been used
                  ([[Bomford and Staniforth 1981]]). We now know that old paint
                  films form an ionomeric structure that continues to
                  deteriorate by hydrolysis and oxidation. Saponification
                  reactions of free acids with alkaline or basic metals present
                  in finer pigments, such as calcium, magnesium, lead, and zinc,
                  can dissolve pigments into the paint. Removal of these
                  light-dispersing pigments causes the paint to increase in
                  transparency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I recently made some experiments involving mixing acid-base
                  titration indicators into various fresh white oil paints and
                  then painting them out. In a few minutes, the pH 4, 4.1, and
                  4.7 indicators began to change color, but the pH 3.3 and 3.7
                  indicators remained unchanged for months. For comparison,
                  samples were removed and exposed to ammonia vapor to return
                  them to their initial color (for a short time). Similar
                  control samples in artists acrylic paint did not change color
                  at all. This demonstrates that oil paint becomes acidic within
                  a short period of time ([[Hackney 2020]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The acidic nature of dried oil paint is the reason why artists
                  do not paint directly on canvas but instead protect it with a
                  coat of glue size. The application of an oil ground or paint
                  on top of this water-soluble size layer produces many of the
                  structural and mechanical problems that we have to deal with.
                  A hot glue size will engulf the canvas, but when applied cold
                  it can accumulate on the canvas surface ([[Morgan et al.
                  2012]]). If and when a glue size cracks, its barrier
                  properties are reduced and volatile breakdown products (VOCs)
                  may reach the canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Similarly, if we add a consolidating or lining adhesive that
                  can become acidic on oxidation, the canvas will be exposed to
                  more rapid deterioration. These arguments suggest more
                  research is needed into both conservation adhesives and ways
                  of achieving adequate deacidification of canvas ([[Hackney,
                  Townsend, and Wyplosz 1996]]; [[Ryder 1986]]).

                  The concentration in air is not in itself a measure of
                  reaction rate, but it shows that more molecules are available
                  to react. Below 0.5 AER (air exchange rate), the rate of
                  off-gassing of acetic acid, both from the packaging and (some)
                  from the object, exceeds the combined leakage rate and rate of
                  deposition or reaction, the latter being slow processes. When
                  reactive molecules collide, only a small proportion react, but
                  in these circumstances trapped pollution molecules can collide
                  many times and will eventually react. The introduction of
                  sacrificial adsorbers or reactants might therefore be useful,
                  provided they are placed close to the object.

                  There is still plenty to do, but at last we know that we can
                  build on a growing body of knowledge. We still need to turn
                  this knowledge resource into genuine expertise and practical
                  conservation experience. We also need to embed in our minds
                  the concept of preventing deterioration, which will be
                  appreciated by future practitioners who will be still
                  addressing the same ethical issues. The Conserving Canvas
                  symposium provided a useful forum to take stock of recent
                  progress and to assess its contribution to the development of
                  an agreed way forward.

                <p>
                  Those studying the mechanical behavior of artist paints and
                  painting structures will likely begin with the general
                  elastic-plastic stress-strain relationships often discussed in
                  introductory engineering texts. A classic diagram will label
                  elastic modulus, yield point, ultimate tensile strength, and
                  failure strain from a simple tensile test. The concepts then
                  become incredibly complex when delving deeper into the
                  response of polymeric materials under varying conditions. This
                  is particularly true for artists paints when considering the
                  influence of temperature, rate of deformation, moisture
                  content, additives to the polymer matrix, and many other
                  factors. To accurately characterize the small-strain behavior
                  of paint films over a wide range of conditions, it often
                  necessary to consider a linear viscoelastic material model
                  ([[Ferry 1980]]). Describing the large-strain response may
                  require adding hyperelasticity ([[Treloar 1975]]) for an
                  extension to a nonlinear viscoelastic material ([[Christensen
                  1982]]). An example of this approach was developed for acrylic
                  (latex) artists paints containing titanium dioxide ([[Hagan et
                  al. 2009]]), which provided parameters for finite element
                  analysis in software such as Abaqus. Calibrating such a
                  model—even for one material—is no easy task. It involves many
                  tests and numerical iteration to solve the best fit parameters
                  to experimental data, and simplifying assumptions still
                  remain.

                  When pigment particles are included in the polymer matrix of a
                  paint film the material becomes a particle-filled composite
                  with a viscoelastic matrix. Stiffness enhancement as a
                  function of particle volume concentration is described in many
                  micromechanics models; however, most give little consideration
                  to geometry effects. The Mori-Tanaka theory is particularly
                  useful since it considers the influence of particle shape and
                  orientation in addition to volume fraction ([[Tandon and Weng
                  1986]]). Clements and Mas extended this theory from an elastic
                  to linear viscoelastic matrix for small-strain modeling
                  ([[Clements and Mas 2001]]). The effects of particle shape and
                  concentration were highlighted for artists acrylic paints
                  using kaolin, calcium carbonate (aragonite), and titanium
                  dioxide as an inorganic phase in a recent study ([[Hagan et
                  al. 2011a]]). From this research, it is easy to imagine that
                  the properties of a paint layer may be different along a
                  brushstroke relative to the transverse direction, due to the
                  alignment of pigment particles with an aspect ratio not equal
                  to 1. The composite structure of a painting on canvas adds
                  further complexity given the layering of different materials
                  and boundary conditions at the stretcher. Common treatment
                  approaches, such as linings, add further variables.

                <p>
                  It is impractical to think that we can precisely understand
                  the mechanical behavior of paintings with so many influencing
                  factors, which additionally include chemical effects of the
                  aging process, the physical aging of polymers ([[Struik
                  1980]]), load cycling, fracture, and delamination
                  ([[Tantideeravit et al. 2013]]). While researchers work to
                  better understand and model these materials for risk analysis,
                  it is important to use the best information available in a
                  heuristic approach to resolving practical problems of the
                  moment. Waller and Michalski emphasized the value of
                  heuristics in preventative conservation:
                </p>
                <p>
                  A fully rational approach would require that all possibly
                  relevant information be obtained and used in arriving at a
                  decision or evaluation. The cost of—and time required for—a
                  fully rational decision is infinite. Instead, a conservator
                  evaluates, using heuristics (simple rules of thumb or
                  intuition), whether there is an advantage in seeking more
                  information before deciding whether a particular issue, such
                  as a risk to a collection, is significant or not. ([[Waller
                  and Michalski 2004, 6]])
                </p>
                <p>
                  In “Toward a Definition of the Engineering Method,” Koen
                  defines <em>heuristics</em> as “anything that provides a
                  plausible aid or direction in the solution of a problem but is
                  in the final analysis unjustified, incapable of justification
                  and fallible. It is anything that is used to guide, discover
                  and reveal a possible, but not necessarily, correct way to
                  solve a problem” ([[Koen 1988, 308]]). An important comparison
                  is given to the different approaches of the scientific and
                  engineering methods. Koen also states that “the engineering
                  method is the use of engineering heuristics to cause the best
                  change in a poorly understood situation within the available
                  resources” ([[Koen 1988, 308]]). There is clearly a similarity
                  between the work of a heritage conservation professional and
                  an engineer, with respect to problem-solving under challenging
                  circumstances with many unknowns.

                <p>
                  A pertinent example of the engineering method is found in the
                  renowned body of research by Mecklenburg related to the
                  mechanics of artist materials and the effects of the museum
                  environment. In the proceedings of the 1991 Art in Transit
                  meeting, Mecklenburg and Tumosa present findings that
                  highlight the tensile properties of artists paints as a
                  function of strain rate ([[Mecklenburg and Tumosa 1991]]). In
                  contrast, subsequent research gives descriptions of material
                  behavior that use an elastic-plastic (time-independent) model
                  ([[Mecklenburg 2005]]). Strain rate is fixed to a constant
                  value in mechanical tests to generate timely and practical
                  information on the effects of the museum environment without
                  the burden of viscoelastic theory.

                  The aim of this paper is to revisit some key concepts in the
                  time-dependent mechanical behavior of paintings, as a
                  supplement to fundamental knowledge of mechanics. The concepts
                  relate to many of the treatment methods used in practice where
                  material behavior is altered by changing different parameters.
                  Detailed theory and test results are presented elsewhere;
                  therefore, focus is given to generalized trends for clarity. A
                  brief review of lining effects on stiffness and stress
                  relaxation of painting is also provided to complement a more
                  in-depth discussion regarding the Canadian Conservation
                  Institute (CCI) Lining Project ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]).

                  <em>Stress-strain curves</em>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  A stress-strain curve is derived from a simple tensile test,
                  and it is often used to characterize the mechanical properties
                  of painting materials. Force and displacement measurements are
                  converted to stress and strain in order to remove the effects
                  of sample geometry. The initial slope of a stress-strain curve
                  in uniaxial tension is a measure of stiffness called the
                  modulus of elasticity, <em>E</em>, or Young’s modulus.
                  Experiments in shear mode define the shear modulus, while
                  hydrostatic pressure gives the bulk modulus. For a
                  viscoelastic material, these elastic moduli are time
                  dependent, and the stress-strain relationship is nonlinear due
                  to polymer relaxation during the test.
                  <a href="#fig-2-1"><strong>Fig. 2.1</strong></a> shows
                  stress-strain curves from a series of tensile tests performed
                  on free films of an artist’s oil paint. The results highlight
                  that the modulus decreases with higher temperature and reduced
                  rate of deformation, while the failure strain increases.
                  Despite this trend, there is no simple relationship between
                  stiffness and failure strain for materials in general. A
                  material may be stiff and brittle or compliant and brittle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>Fig. 2.2</strong></a> illustrates
                  the results of a tensile test with the time dimension added.
                  The first graph (<a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>fig. 2.2a</strong></a>) shows the strain history as millistrain versus time, and
                  indicates that the strain rate, <em>R</em>, is constant during
                  the constant speed test due to the low failure strain. At
                  higher strains, the strain rate would measurably decrease
                  during a constant speed test due to the changing length of the
                  sample. The second graph (<a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>fig. 2.2b</strong></a>) gives stress versus time, and the third (<a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>fig. 2.2c</strong></a>) presents a stress-strain curve. The latter shows a secant
                  modulus, <em>E~s~</em> (at strain ε&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.005), and the strain
                  at failure ε~f~. Secant modulus can be a useful measure of
                  stiffness due to nonlinearity caused by relaxation during the
                  tensile test.

                  <em>Stress relaxation</em>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  A relaxation test is another useful experiment for studying
                  time-dependent material properties, and it is particularly
                  relevant to canvas-supported paintings.
                  <a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>Fig. 2.3</strong></a> illustrates
                  the different parameters in a stress-relaxation test performed
                  on a Winsor and Newton Foundation White film. The first graph
                  (<a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>fig. 2.3a</strong></a>) shows the strain history as an initial loading ramp,
                  followed by constant strain during measurement of stress
                  relaxation. The second (<a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>fig. 2.3b</strong></a>) shows the loading ramp on a stress-strain curve, and a
                  vertical drop in stress during the constant strain segment.
                  <strong><a href="#fig-2-3">Fig. 2.3c</a></strong> gives the
                  stress relaxation process on a plot of stress versus time,
                  where it appears that stress is approaching equilibration
                  after a sharp initial drop. The final plot (<a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>fig. 2.3d</strong></a>) shows the same data on a log-log scale, and highlights that
                  the sample is still relaxing. The results also show similar
                  findings for a repeat test that was performed on the same
                  sample after a twenty-four-hour recovery period. During cyclic
                  load testing on viscoelastic materials, it is important to
                  consider strain history and its effects on repeated
                  measurements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The stress-relaxation test method outlined in
                  <a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>fig. 2.3</strong></a> is the
                  approach used in the CCI Lining Project to investigate the
                  effects of different lining treatments for paintings on canvas
                  ([[Michalski and Daly Hartin 1996]]). From recent work,
                  <a href="#fig-2-4"><strong>fig. 2.4</strong></a> shows a plot
                  of tension (kN/m) versus time after a fixed strain was applied
                  to each sample ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]). The initial
                  sharp spike is caused by the rapid initial strain (see
                  <a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>figs. 2.3b and c</strong></a>), which is followed by a quick decay in tension due to
                  stress relaxation. The model painting with a linen lining
                  shows no difference from the model painting (unlined) over the
                  measurement time scale. The sailcloth lining causes a uniform
                  vertical shift in tension due to the stiffness of the fabric,
                  which is constant over the sixty-hour period. An advantage of
                  the sailcloth lining is that its stiffness allows for a stable
                  increase in tension, with less strain imposed on the painting.
                  In fact, the strain could be reduced to roughly half and still
                  maintain a similar tension to the model painting in the
                  experimental time scale. The wax resin lining also shows a
                  strong vertical shift due to the wax stiffness; however, it
                  also exhibits relaxation characteristics.

                  The addition of relative humidity (RH) fluctuations in
                  <a href="#fig-2-4"><strong>fig. 2.4</strong></a> highlights
                  some further trends in the lined painting response. Sailcloth
                  and linen have no effect on the response of the painting,
                  since the linings do not constrain the paint layers in the
                  direction of applied tension—that is, painting and lining are
                  free to shift across one another. In contrast, the wax lining
                  impregnates the canvas and constrains the paint layers from
                  shrinking or swelling due to contact with the supporting
                  layers of the painting. The paint layers still respond to RH
                  fluctuations; however, the wax adds surface constraint that
                  prevents movement and a subsequent change in tension measured
                  at the ends of the sample. A more in-depth discussion of the
                  CCI Lining Project is provided by Daly Hartin and colleagues
                  ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]); therefore, the following
                  discussion provides more general information regarding the
                  viscoelastic behavior of painting materials.

                  <em>Time-temperature superposition</em>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Over a wide range of test conditions, it is impractical to
                  summarize tensile data from a viscoelastic material with
                  stress-strain curves. It is also not feasible to measure the
                  full relaxation behavior from glassy to rubbery—a process
                  occurring over many decades—at one temperature, due to
                  equipment limitations and time constraints. In
                  <a href="#fig-2-1"><strong>fig. 2.1</strong></a>, it is clear that a relationship exists between strain rate
                  and temperature, since increasing the rate by an order of
                  magnitude is equivalent to decreasing temperature by 10°C.
                  This implies that time-temperature superposition (TTS) is a
                  potential tool for efficiently summarizing data ({Williams,
                  Landel, and Ferry 1955}). To illustrate this method,
                  <a href="#fig-2-5"><strong>fig. 2.5a</strong></a> shows a
                  simplified summary of modulus values at three temperatures and
                  four strain rates within a practical test window. This test
                  window is bounded by equipment limitations and practical time
                  available for data collection.
                  <a href="#fig-2-5"><strong>Fig. 2.5b</strong></a> shows the
                  result of fixing data at a chosen reference temperature,
                  <em>T~ref~</em> = 20°C, and horizontally shifting data at the
                  other temperatures to line up as a single master curve. The
                  result shows a shift from glassy to rubbery behavior over a
                  broader scale than the experiments allowed in direct
                  measurement. Tabulated results of the horizontal shift factor
                  versus temperature allow one to create a master curve at any
                  <em>T~ref~</em> of interest within data limits. Defining
                  <em>T~ref~</em> at the glass transition temperature,
                  <em>T~g~</em>, would also allow comparison with theoretical
                  functions, and possible extrapolation to temperatures beyond
                  the test conditions. There are many reasons why the simple TTS
                  method may not work for certain materials; however, it is a
                  powerful tool when it does.

                  It is helpful to consider practical situations where the
                  viscoelastic properties are of importance. As a simple
                  example,
                  <a href="#fig-2-6"><strong>fig. 2.6a</strong></a> shows a
                  schematic of a broken and curled flake of paint that is
                  deformed back into the plane of the painting. The radius of
                  curvature (<em>r</em>) and film thickness (<em>h</em>) are
                  labeled simply to highlight that it is possible to estimate
                  the strain rate from a few parameters and define the time
                  scale of the applied deformation. Rolling or unrolling a
                  canvas painting is another similar and geometrically simple
                  example. In <a href="#fig-2-6"><strong>fig. 2.6b</strong></a>, the stiffness reduction caused by decreasing the rate of
                  deformation is shown as the path from point A to point B along
                  the master curve. In contrast, path A→C indicates the effect
                  of keeping the same strain rate but using higher temperature
                  to shift the master curve horizontally. The higher temperature
                  accelerates the polymer relaxation and leads to a lower
                  stiffness at a given strain rate. The horizontal shift may
                  also be caused by a plasticizing effect, such as an increase
                  in moisture content ([[Maksimov, Mochalov, and Urzhumtsev
                  1972]]). Path A→D shows a final example from the combined
                  effect of decreasing the rate of deformation while also
                  increasing temperature. Care should, of course, be taken when
                  increasing temperature and moisture content, since extremes
                  may cause unwanted effects beyond the simple relaxation
                  process described here.

                  The concepts discussed in this section are often studied using
                  a technique called dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)
                  ([[Nielsen and Landel 1994]]). This can rapidly give modulus
                  data as a function of temperature and frequency using a single
                  sample, and also show transition regions. Experiments
                  involving tensile tests are typically used when the
                  large-strain response, or failure properties, are of interest.

                <p>
                  The purpose of using tensile test data in studies of artists
                  paints is due to the interest in characterizing their
                  large-strain response, particularly the failure criteria as a
                  function of time and temperature. The related research work of
                  Thor Smith in the 1960s is of interest since it shows the
                  application of TTS to the ultimate properties of plastics and
                  elastomers. Smith clearly summarizes an important finding in
                  one of his many papers on this topic:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The ultimate tensile properties (the stress at break σ~b~,
                    and the corresponding extension ratio λ~b~) vary markedly
                    with the temperature and with the stress-time or strain-time
                    history prior to rupture. Considerable evidence indicates
                    that data obtained at different temperatures can often be
                    superposed to give master curves which show the variation of
                    σ~b~ and λ~b~ over many decades of time at a fixed
                    temperature. Further, the temperature shift factor is the
                    same—or nearly the same—as that used to superpose
                    viscoelastic data representing small-deformation behavior.
                    In other words, the same molecular parameters which
                    influence chain mobility, thus the time and temperature
                    dependence of linear viscoelastic response, also have a
                    controlling effect on the time and temperature dependence of
                    the ultimate tensile properties. ([[Smith 1965, 275]])

                  Recent studies on artists paints have highlighted the
                  application of this approach for generating master curves of
                  failure strains from tensile data.
                  <a href="#fig-2-7"><strong>Fig. 2.7a</strong></a> shows a
                  generalized illustration of a failure envelope created using a
                  similar approach to that shown for modulus data (see
                  <a href="#fig-2-5"><strong>fig. 2.5</strong></a>). The path to point A results in failure before reaching the
                  target strain at the defined strain rate. Reducing the strain
                  rate avoids failure for the path to point B, which is outside
                  of the failure envelope.
                  <a href="#fig-2-7"><strong>Fig. 2.7b</strong></a> shows the
                  path to point C outside of the failure envelope due to a
                  horizontal shift of the master curve from a temperature
                  increase or possibly a plasticizing effect (e.g., increased
                  moisture content). Combining higher temperature and reduced
                  strain rate locates point D even further from the failure
                  line.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This concept of a failure strain mastercurve is also shown in
                  figure 2.8 using tensile data from two artists paint films at
                  <em>T~ref~</em> = 20°C ({Hagan 2017}). The acrylic paint film
                  (<a href="#fig-2-8"><strong>fig. 2.8a</strong></a>) shows a considerably larger combination of strains and
                  strain rates that avoid failure compared to the oil paint (<a href="#fig-2-8"><strong>fig. 2.8b</strong></a>). This illustrates why cracking of acrylics latex paints is
                  much less common than traditional oils over a wide range of
                  conditions.

                <h2 id="conclusions" tabindex="-1">Conclusions</h2>
                <p>
                  An overview of the viscoelastic properties of artists painting
                  materials was provided to highlight important trends in their
                  mechanical behavior. Example tensile test and stress
                  relaxation data were presented for paint films and lined
                  painting samples respectively. These data showed a time and
                  temperature dependence on measured stiffness and failure
                  strains. For lined painting samples, stress-relaxation data
                  indicated clear differences in the response of different
                  treatment methods. The sailcloth lining showed value in
                  maintaining consistent tension over time, potentially reducing
                  the amount of strain on the painting for a given tension.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The concepts were further developed through a discussion of
                  the time-temperature superposition principle and the creation
                  of master curves of stiffness and failure strains. This
                  technique can effectively summarize properties over a broad
                  time scale and may be referenced at a temperature of interest.
                  The master curves were used to illustrate how stiffness and
                  failure strains are manipulated by changing the rate of
                  deformation, temperature, or moisture content. In practice, it
                  is not possible to know the shape of these curves for the wide
                  variety of materials found in paintings; however, an
                  understanding of the trends in material behavior is important
                  when applying heuristics to treatment methods.
