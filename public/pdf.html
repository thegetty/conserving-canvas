                  In 2019 Yale University, with the support of the Getty
                  Foundation, held an international conference, where nearly
                  four hundred attendees from more than twenty countries
                  gathered to discuss a vital topic: how best to conserve
                  paintings on canvas. It was the first major symposium on the
                  subject since 1974, when wax-resin and glue-paste lining
                  reigned as the predominant conservation techniques. Over the
                  past fifty years, such methods, which were often destructive
                  to artworks, have become less widely used in favor of more
                  minimalist approaches to intervention. More recent decades
                  have witnessed the reevaluation of traditional practices as
                  well as focused research supporting significant new
                  methodologies, procedures, and synthetic materials for the
                  care and conservation of paintings on fabric supports.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Conserving Canvas compiles the proceedings of the conference,
                  presenting a wide array of papers and posters that provide
                  important global perspectives on the history, current state,
                  and future needs of the field. Featuring an expansive glossary
                  of terms that will be an invaluable resource for conservators
                  and other practitioners, this publication promises to become a
                  standard reference for the international conservation
                  community.

                  We are delighted to present the proceedings of the October
                  2019 international symposium <em>Conserving Canvas</em>. Like
                  the Getty Foundation initiative carrying the same name, the
                  symposium focused on the structural care and conservation of
                  paintings on fabric supports. Organized by the Institute for
                  the Preservation of Cultural Heritage at Yale University, and
                  with support from the Yale University Art Gallery and Yale
                  Center for British Art, this momentous event gathered no less
                  than 370 conservators and conservation scientists from around
                  the globe on Yale’s campus in 2019 to discuss what was once a
                  heated topic in the field. Here we are referring to the method
                  of wax-resin lining that previously dominated in the field and
                  was heavily criticized and largely abandoned after the
                  legendary 1974 conference held at the National Maritime Museum
                  in Greenwich, England. At that conference, conservators
                  ushered in an era of new approaches, alternative procedures,
                  and novel synthetic materials. The 2019 Yale conference was
                  the first major international gathering on the subject since
                  1974, allowing specialists to look back on more than
                  forty-five years of practice and take stock of the current
                  state of the field. Thanks to the symposium organizers,
                  professionals from India to Argentina, from Scotland to South
                  Africa met each other and exchanged ideas, setting new
                  standards for international inclusion in the field. We extend
                  special recognition and thanks to the organizers and advisors
                  who worked hard to make this experience so valuable for so
                  many: Ian McClure, Elizabeth Williams, Cynthia Schwarz, Mikkel
                  Scharf, Christina Young, Alan Phenix, and Jim Coddington.

                  The care and conservation of paintings on canvas is an ongoing
                  concern for museums around the world. Ever since the 1974
                  Greenwich conference, many conservators have shied away from
                  structural repairs perceived as being too invasive. In many
                  cases this led to unintended consequences, with new
                  generations of conservators possessing little to no practical
                  experience with structural treatments. To address this
                  knowledge gap, the Getty Foundation in 2018 launched the
                  Conserving Canvas grant initiative, which to date has
                  supported twenty-six projects involving conservators and other
                  specialists from more than three dozen countries. The
                  Conserving Canvas initiative is ensuring that conservators
                  remain fully informed about how to preserve these important
                  works of art through support for training activities,
                  scientific research, and information sharing.&nbsp;The Yale
                  conference was a crucial launching pad for this work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As you will read in this volume, presenters at the
                  <em>Conserving Canvas</em> symposium addressed historical
                  approaches to the treatment of canvas paintings; highlighted
                  current methods, materials, and research; and pointed to the
                  growing challenges associated with the structural conservation
                  of modern and contemporary works. While the record indicates
                  that the atmosphere at the Greenwich conference was quite
                  contentious, the Yale conference could not have been more
                  collegial. Productive dialogue and discussion proved how much
                  the field has developed in the last four decades, and the
                  energy and enthusiasm generated among participants was
                  positively electric. Over four days the presenters shared
                  diverse views and approaches, which prompted frank and
                  in-depth conversations. The forty papers and twenty-three
                  posters presented in these proceedings reflect that quality
                  and diversity.

                  The symposium held at Yale in October 2019 grew out of the
                  Getty Foundation’s Conserving Canvas initiative, which,
                  through a combination of practical workshops, publications and
                  research support, and expert meetings, aims to evaluate and
                  foster the structural treatment of paintings on canvas (<a href="#fig-0-1"><strong>fig. 0.1</strong></a>). The symposium was planned with the 1974 Greenwich
                  Conference on Comparative Lining Techniques,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  the last international conference to be held on this subject,
                  very much in mind. In 1974, conservators from institutions and
                  in private practice demonstrated a wide range of techniques,
                  both innovative and traditional, and in doing so raised some
                  fundamental questions that are still central to our thinking
                  and decision-making process in planning structural treatments.
                  In the forty-five years since, however, the options for lining
                  and alternatives to lining have expanded. The new options are
                  drawn from a variety of sources: advances in the materials
                  industry, with the production of synthetic adhesives and
                  textiles and the introduction of nanotechnology; new research
                  into the mechanical behavior of laminate structures; and the
                  resourcefulness of conservators who approach their work with
                  innovation. Concerns at the forefront of the field in 2019
                  also included environmental sustainability and a heightened
                  awareness of the benefits of a global perspective on painting
                  conservation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The timeliness of the Conserving Canvas initiative and the
                  conference is clear. In the planning stages, it was thought
                  the sessions would be held on Yale’s West Campus, where the
                  conservation studios and Institute for Preservation of
                  Cultural Heritage are located. High demand quickly dictated a
                  move to the more spacious auditorium at the Yale Art Gallery,
                  which filled to capacity. The auditorium was filled with over
                  370 attendees from more than twenty-five countries, likely the
                  largest gathering of painting conservators ever convened (<a href="#fig-0-2"><strong>fig. 0.2</strong></a>). This interest in the topic was also mirrored in the
                  international response in papers presented by conservators who
                  represented more than twenty countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The impact of the postprints of the 1974 conference was even
                  greater than the conference itself, as they not only presented
                  to a much wider audience the different approaches introduced
                  there, but also questioned previously held assumptions. While
                  the conference provided the opportunity for conservators to
                  compare lining techniques, with a focus on practical
                  workshops, the necessity of lining as a preservation measure
                  was ultimately called into question. For many, the most
                  perceptive and significant paper was the opening presentation
                  by Westby Percival-Prescott, “The Lining Cycle,” in which he
                  demonstrated how artists’ techniques of a certain period would
                  affect the response of those paintings to particular lining
                  practices at the time, usually evident many years later when
                  those paintings were deemed to require lining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Percival-Prescott’s paper, after reviewing different lining
                  techniques, called for research into methods that might
                  prevent the necessity of lining (see
                  <a href="#paper-42">Stoner</a> in this publication). In effect,
                  a call for historical research and a minimalist approach were
                  made.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With this context in mind, the call for papers for this
                  symposium made in September 2018 announced, “The symposium
                  will address historical approaches to and theories of the
                  structural conservation of canvas paintings; current methods,
                  materials and research, both practical and scientific; and the
                  challenges facing the structural conservation of modern and
                  contemporary works.” This reflected, in the view of the
                  Advisory Committee,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  developments and concerns in the structural treatment of works
                  on canvas today. The response to the call for papers was much
                  larger than expected and the proposals submitted guided the
                  committee to choose the sections laid out in these postprints.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While Percival-Prescott’s paper was unique in providing an
                  historical review in 1974, in the 2019 symposium historical
                  research played a very significant role. The recent research
                  into contemporary documentary sources, discussed in
                  contributions by <a href="#paper-5">Angela Cerasuolo</a>,
                  <a href="#paper-10">Matteo Rossi-Doria</a>, and
                  <a href="#paper-18">Ana Calvo et al.</a>, attest to considered
                  practices dating back to the eighteenth century and before. In
                  many cases written sources can be linked to surviving
                  treatments, often demonstrating the unexpected longevity of
                  linings carried out with natural materials. A strong case is
                  made for the use of natural materials—both for their low
                  toxicity and their performance over time. On the other hand,
                  assumptions about the stabilizing hydrophobic attributes of
                  wax-resin treatments were called into question by new
                  research, as can be seen, for example, in the work by [Emilie
                  Froment](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/paper-46).
                  A divide on seeking flexibility (as in mist lining) or
                  rigidity (as demonstrated in
                  <a href="#paper-22">Lynne Harrison’s paper</a>) in a lining or
                  lining system emerged, which also represented the trends of
                  research on lining procedures, and the mechanical behavior of
                  the composite structure of paintings since the Greenwich
                  Lining Conference. The fact that many of the practical and
                  philosophical divides in structural practices still fall along
                  geographic lines speaks to the sustained, deep roots in
                  historic treatment practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another theme that emerged at the conference was an emphasis
                  on the history and treatment of collections as a whole, as
                  well as forward-looking preventive care of collections. Here,
                  too, the role of past and ongoing research was evident,
                  although perhaps not always carried over into practice.
                  Increased levels of documentation also allow for the
                  examination and analysis of more data, mostly focused on
                  collections and their treatment histories. The greater
                  attention to documentation has enabled reviews of
                  institutional practice—which, when the data is extensive
                  enough, reveals trends, as evidenced in the contributions by
                  <a href="#paper-34">Nicola Costaras</a> and [Lauren Bradley and
                  Josh
                  Summer](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/paper-42).
                  A series of case studies covered the treatment of works large
                  and small and highlighted the significant attention paid to
                  local interventions, which demonstrate conservation’s
                  continuing ability to adopt and adapt existing techniques and
                  equipment from other fields, such as textile conservation,
                  imaging technology, and mechanical engineering. Papers
                  included research using samples of significant natural aging
                  and showed the ongoing embrace of new materials—both from
                  other fields and those specifically developed for
                  conservation. The audience was introduced to
                  <a href="#paper-30">Flock and Demuth’s “Winnie”</a> for the
                  application of glue in tear mends, for example, as well as the
                  adhesive meshes developed by
                  <a href="#paper-28">Mona Konietzny et al.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Threaded through all of these topics at the conference was the
                  ongoing question of definitions, of finding a common
                  vocabulary to describe—with as much precision and accuracy as
                  possible—what conservators see and do. This is especially
                  critical in order to exchange philosophies, methodologies, and
                  techniques with an international community that has grown out
                  of a variety of historic traditions and practice in vastly
                  different climates. To that end, we have included a
                  <a href="#glossary">glossary</a> based on the one published in
                  the 1974 preprints. Terms no longer in use have been deleted
                  and terms that have become current have been added. It is our
                  hope that this revised glossary reflects developments since
                  1974 while also attempting to define terms that can be used
                  universally. Finally, around the margins, but clearly moving
                  to a central position, is the question of sustainability, in
                  all its various forms. Indeed here is a term in need of
                  definition and common understanding.

                  One part of the conference that is not available to the reader
                  of these proceedings is the day devoted to practical
                  demonstrations—“sandbox sessions” that provided the
                  opportunity for experiential learning (<a href="#fig-0-3"><strong>fig. 0.3</strong></a>). Expert contributors led sessions on historic
                  reconstructions, innovative tools and equipment, hands-on
                  mechanical demonstrations, and localized tear mending. It is
                  the continued refinement of established practice, as well as
                  development of new, more effective practices, that these
                  sessions represent, and to which we believe these proceedings
                  will be an ongoing contribution.

                  None of this would have been possible without the support of a
                  large network of our generous, capable colleagues. First,
                  thanks are owed to the rest of the symposium Advisory
                  Committee: Alan Phenix, Mikkel Scharff, Anton Wilmering, and
                  Christina Young. At Getty, thanks also to Joan Weinstein and
                  Allison Reilly. At Yale, thanks go out to Stephanie Wiles;
                  Henry J. Heinz II, director of the Yale University Art
                  Gallery; and Courtney Martin, director of the Yale Center for
                  British Art, for their support, contribution of space and
                  resources to the symposium, and hospitality shown to the
                  participants. The conference would not have been possible
                  without the ongoing efforts of Laurie Batza, Beth Bolen, and
                  Elizabeth Williams at the Yale Institute for the Preservation
                  of Cultural Heritage. Also thanks to the Yale Conferences and
                  Events staff, especially Shannon LeGault, who arranged two
                  meals a day and warm welcomes for our 370 participants. The
                  Avangrid Foundation provided critical funding support for
                  presenters and attendees from Spain, and our special thanks go
                  to Nicole Licata Grant. The program books were designed by
                  Stephanie Bedoya with the assistance of Yale University Art
                  Gallery designer Chris Sleboda, who also designed the tote
                  bags for the participants. Advertising support from Willard
                  Conservation Products, Everett Fine Art, and Getty
                  Publications made the program books possible. At the Yale
                  University Art Gallery, thanks are owed to Molleen Theodore,
                  Liz Harnett, Mark Paturzo, and Roksana Filipowska. Many Yale
                  University conservators, conservation fellows, and interns
                  contributed to the success of the symposium, from hosting
                  guests and providing directions to assisting in sandbox
                  sessions and hanging posters, and to too many other supportive
                  roles to mention. Our deep thanks for this to Irma Passeri,
                  Kelsey Wingel, Mark Aronson, Jessica David, Anne Gunnison,
                  Olav Bjornerud, and Beth Godcher. We hope that this
                  publication will be of great value to the international
                  conservation community for years to come.

                        Many of these effects changed the appearance of the
                        paintings. These changes to the structure, topography,
                        and other attributes of the painting have been described
                        in various ways in the conservation literature. Most
                        importantly, though, a consensus emerged that these
                        changes compromised the aesthetic integrity of the
                        painting, bringing aesthetic discussions of the surfaces
                        of paintings to the fore as well as discussion of
                        technical matters.

                  In the latter part of the twentieth century, conservators
                  questioned the practice of lining paintings on canvas. This
                  inspired fundamental scientific studies of the structure,
                  material, and aging of paintings. The implications of
                  mechanical and chemical aging can now be better predicted.
                  This knowledge has provided conservators with a wide choice of
                  alternative treatments, and it supports the concept of
                  collections care.

                  Structural Conservation
                </h2>
                <p>
                  By addressing the structure of a painting, we are forced to
                  consider not only the image intended by the artist but also
                  the artwork’s physical nature and history. A stretched canvas
                  is a subtle and delicate construction devised for both
                  stability and lightness, but if the structure is damaged or
                  failing, this creates risks for both the appearance and
                  purpose of a painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As any artifact ages and deteriorates, it eventually reaches a
                  point when its appearance and functions are judged no longer
                  acceptable. Some of these changes demand action in order to
                  preserve the artifact’s use and prevent further decay. Some
                  changes are not reversible—for instance, cracks, which
                  indicate fragility and may also cause a disturbing
                  interference with an image. Yet, for a painting, cracks are
                  also viewed as a sign of authenticity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Structural conservation of a canvas painting can be a more
                  profound intervention than cleaning or varnish removal, and
                  each intervention presents fundamental aesthetic challenges
                  for the paint surface and ethical doubts for the concept of
                  reversibility. A structural treatment may be applied to an
                  entire painting, perhaps in a single rapid operation. Like
                  other aspects of conservation, such a treatment requires
                  considerable judgment and skill, and success is often judged
                  by its invisibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fifty years ago, a traditional lining method was considered a
                  normal component of any conservation treatment. The lining
                  used was defined by the choice of adhesive, and these
                  materials had a surprisingly wide range of properties, from
                  water based to water repellent. The goal of lining was to turn
                  a fragile canvas painting into one that was much more
                  resilient, but the means and the outcome were not well
                  defined. The dangers in lining were recognized, however, and
                  it was normally carried out by skilled and experienced
                  professionals. But attempts were also made to automate and
                  deskill the process by using hot tables and vacuum pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the student, there was little published information except
                  for some early discussions on reservations about glue lining,
                  the justification for introducing wax-resin adhesives, and
                  designs for hot tables ([[Ruhemann 1953]]; [[Straub and
                  Rees-Jones 1955]]). From this background, W. Percival-Prescott
                  conceived the Conference on Comparative Lining Techniques,
                  held in Greenwich (London) in 1974. This ambitious project
                  brought together experts from various backgrounds, but it
                  succeeded in uncovering much confusion of purpose and also a
                  genuine desire to improve the situation ([[Percival-Prescott
                  2003b]]). Traditional methods were described by practitioners,
                  and several research projects investigating alternative
                  adhesives and lining methods were presented. A wide variety of
                  conservation aims emerged, from restoring the original
                  appearance of a painting to accepting its existing condition
                  ([[Mehra 2003]]). For the first time, the advantages and
                  disadvantages of all materials and methods were openly
                  debated, including wax lining methods ([[Berger and Zeliger
                  2003]]; [[Cummings and Hedley 2003]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  During a period when lining was widely, uncritically accepted,
                  most practitioners had a limited range of experience and had
                  honed their skills in a narrow lining specialty based on one
                  specific adhesive. The establishment of conservation training
                  courses with academic aspirations has now largely replaced the
                  former apprenticeship training, which passed on the strengths
                  and skills of existing practices but had no mechanism to
                  compare or improve on them. Formal training has provided
                  impetus for conservation science, and the study of
                  conservation methods has influenced the materials and practice
                  of conservators, and even some artists.

                  After Greenwich, it was clear that an understanding of the
                  structure and mechanisms of stretched canvas paintings was
                  needed. This has since been achieved by a number of
                  researchers, beginning with Marion Mecklenburg and his
                  systematic studies that provided measurements of painting
                  materials under tension and in different RH conditions,
                  identifying the high tension in glue films and grounds at low
                  humidity. Measurements of breaking strains of oil paint films
                  led to an explanation of the observed cracking of canvas
                  paintings ([<strong>fig. 1.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-1)).

                  The response of paintings to moisture had been a particular
                  concern since the nineteenth century. Mecklenburg’s plot of
                  tension against RH for all the materials on a stretched and
                  primed canvas was a major advance ([[Mecklenburg 1982]];
                  [[Mecklenburg and Tumosa 1991a]]). Gerry Hedley explained the
                  mechanism of canvas shrinking when exposed to water or RH
                  approaching 100%. He also saw the effect of initial weave
                  crimp transfer from warp to weft ([[Hedley 1993]]; [[Hedley
                  and Odlyha 1993]]). The differing influence of pigments on the
                  drying (curing) of linseed oil explained why the application
                  of moisture and pressure is not enough to flatten most mature
                  lead white paints. Temperature response of paintings was also
                  investigated ([[Michalski 1991]]). Cracking of otherwise
                  flexible acrylic paintings at extremely low temperatures was
                  at first surprising. The concept of glass transition
                  temperature (Tg) clarified why familiar flexible materials
                  became brittle at these low temperatures.

                  Long-term mechanical behavior, such as relaxation and creep,
                  have also been measured, providing useful predictions of
                  future behavior. It took sixteen years to collect the data
                  shown in [<strong>fig. 1.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-2)
                  at the Canadian Conservation Institute, which shows the
                  relaxation (loss of tension) of stretched canvas paintings and
                  linings over that period of time, plotted on a logarithmic
                  time axis. Such data is critical when deciding on the best
                  choice of adhesive and lining material.

                  The use of biaxial stretching, first proposed by Berger
                  ({Berger and Russell 2000}), and electronic speckle pattern
                  interferometry (ESPI) for strain measurement ([<strong>fig. 1.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-3))
                  enabled Young and Hibberd to look in further detail at
                  conservation issues and lining practice, such as the strain
                  associated with stretcher attachments ([[Young and Hibberd
                  1999]]; [[Young and Hibberd 2000]]). The complex structure of
                  stretched canvas is now understood in sufficient detail to
                  consider computer modeling of the mechanical properties of
                  both paintings and linings. It also offers the opportunity to
                  study in more detail the effects of minimal treatments on more
                  contemporary paintings ([[Hagan et al. 2007]]; [[Hagan et al.
                  2011]]). Temporary solutions and physical protection may prove
                  to be our best options, but many have not yet been fully
                  assessed objectively.

                <p>
                  Transferring research results into conservation practice on
                  historic objects involves special problems. Understanding
                  materials in a pristine state is not enough to predict the
                  behavior of deteriorated old paintings ([[Ackroyd 2002]];
                  [[Hackney 2004b]]; [[Phenix 1995]]; [[Reeve 1984]]; [[Scharff
                  2012]]). Since an assessment of physical condition and
                  appropriate treatment requires such knowledge, measuring slow
                  processes, such as “natural” aging, is increasingly necessary
                  in order to make reliable long-term decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Progress in devising and applying new conservation treatments
                  is made difficult because at some stage practical experience
                  can be gained only by working directly on unique and valuable
                  original aged material ([<strong>fig. 1.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-4)).
                  It might be argued that this amounts to carrying out
                  scientific experiments lacking a control. As a consequence, we
                  can choose our treatment method but cannot be sure it was the
                  best of several possible options.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the UK, original nineteenth-century loose linings have
                  provided a limited source of acceptable experimental material,
                  but such material has still not been replicated reliably in
                  all its aspects by artificial aging methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the conservator concerned with historic paintings, it is
                  important to be aware of artists’ changing methods, materials,
                  and intentions. There is much detail, accumulated from the
                  examination of examples of painting practice, to inform the
                  conservator of the likely behavior of a specific painting to
                  be treated. For the period from the latter part of the
                  nineteenth century until the present, artists were less bound
                  by academy controls; their aims became more adventurous, and
                  their materials and methods expanded. As paintings from this
                  period increasingly demand attention and treatment, the
                  conservator is presented with a variety of interesting new
                  problems and conflicts, many of which have already contributed
                  to modified conservation practice for works on canvas,
                  currently leading to a more preventive approach. The demands
                  of much recently created art provide a challenge that requires
                  radical solutions, and they are pointing to new directions in
                  conservation of both contemporary and traditional art
                  ([[Heiber 2003]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some developments of lining processes using new materials,
                  such as sailcloth fabric ([[Hedley and Villers 1982]]) and
                  Beva 371 adhesive ([[Berger 1975]]), have so far survived the
                  test of time. Exploring the properties and stability of
                  possible alternative conservation structural materials is a
                  major undertaking, made more difficult by the risk that
                  material manufacturers may discontinue their supply. Economics
                  also conspire to deter time-consuming structural treatments.
                  As a consequence, for many contemporary paintings, restoration
                  often challenges existing experience and costs much more than
                  preventing damage ([<strong>fig. 1.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-5)).

                <p>
                  Given the many unavoidable problems encountered in
                  conservation treatments, protecting canvases from physical and
                  chemical deterioration is now considered a priority in many
                  museums. For the conservator, it has always been difficult to
                  predict the range of conditions to which a painting has been
                  and could be exposed. The environment that a specific painting
                  is likely to encounter remains uncertain, even within museums.
                  Increasingly, we ask what are the true risks for paintings on
                  canvas and how should we decide when intervention is
                  necessary?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Improvements in the environment of modern museums (controlled
                  and filtered air conditioning, UV filtration); careful
                  handling and operating procedures; and protection during
                  transport and handling have all contributed to more reliable
                  conditions. Defining exact relative humidity/temperature
                  (RH/T) conditions is virtually impossible, but the absence of
                  identifiable damage that can be directly attributed to current
                  museum conditions is a positive indicator. However, more
                  recently, an open-ended commitment to long-term protection by
                  air-conditioning has been challenged as expensive and
                  unsustainable in energy terms.

                  In the past, the risks of travel were unpredictable and
                  thought to be large. Conservators were therefore obliged to
                  reinforce a painting’s structure to the best of their powers.
                  With increasing loan and exhibition programs and major
                  blockbuster exhibitions, this has become an international
                  problem. The transport environment has now been examined in
                  terms of shock, vibration, moisture content, and temperature
                  along with their consequences for paintings in transit.
                  Criteria for behavior and designs for packing cases to
                  minimize exposure to risks have become established. An
                  interesting observation from the Art in Transit research group
                  was that, by using reliable methods and tight procedures,
                  transport risks could be reduced below those of handling
                  within a museum ([[Mecklenburg 1991]]).

                  By introducing consistent procedures for the physical
                  protection of works of art, it is easier to avoid much
                  accidental damage and unnecessary early deterioration.
                  Successful collections care procedures have together made the
                  idea that lining is a requirement much less persuasive and
                  forced us to be more precise about its purpose.

                  For the long-term survival of paintings, the less dramatic yet
                  equally important chemical degradation of canvas, size,
                  ground, and paint needs to be considered. However, the exact
                  condition of aged canvases and their continuing rate of decay
                  cannot be known in sufficient detail and are not readily
                  captured in most risk analysis, which is currently concerned
                  with shorter term, mainly physical activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The slow reactions of oxidation and hydrolysis that take place
                  in degrading cellulose and oil paint are the main reasons that
                  painting materials become fragile. What were originally stable
                  structures no longer perform their design function, and
                  physical damage often follows. Air pollution and light
                  contribute to this deterioration, involving chemical
                  interactions between canvas and its immediate environment.
                  They play a subtle, perhaps unstoppable, role in aging.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the period between 1900 and 1960, air pollution was at its
                  worst in many countries. Most museums were not
                  air-conditioned, and until about 1990 concentrations of
                  particulates and the strong acidic gas sulfur dioxide remained
                  unacceptably high. In the last hundred years or so, exposed
                  canvas has adsorbed sulfur dioxide from air pollution; the
                  sulfur dioxide then reacts with the cellulose in the canvas.
                  The products are not volatile and remain in the canvas,
                  facilitating hydrolysis reactions. All acidity, whether from
                  external and internal pollution or simply from oxidation,
                  cause measurable weakening and embrittlement of the canvas
                  ([<strong>fig. 1.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-6)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Efflorescence can occur on the surface of oil paintings,
                  especially unvarnished ones, and sometimes, on glazed works,
                  it is transferred onto the glass. This deposit has been
                  analyzed as fatty acids ([[Williams 1989]]), and these fatty
                  acids must have been released from the oil paint. The
                  hydrolysis of oils is well known, and migration of its
                  reaction products within dried oil paint films explains
                  efflorescence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There has been a major advance in understanding the
                  degradation of oil paint and how it changes the paint’s
                  optical performance and our perception of a painted image
                  ([[Boon, Van der Weerd, and Keune 2002]]; [[Keune 2005]]). We
                  are all familiar with the increase in transparency of oil
                  paintings and grounds. The impregnation and lining of
                  paintings with thin grounds can cause increases in
                  transparency, especially when wax resin has been used
                  ([[Bomford and Staniforth 1981]]). We now know that old paint
                  films form an ionomeric structure that continues to
                  deteriorate by hydrolysis and oxidation. Saponification
                  reactions of free acids with alkaline or basic metals present
                  in finer pigments, such as calcium, magnesium, lead, and zinc,
                  can dissolve pigments into the paint. Removal of these
                  light-dispersing pigments causes the paint to increase in
                  transparency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I recently made some experiments involving mixing acid-base
                  titration indicators into various fresh white oil paints and
                  then painting them out. In a few minutes, the pH 4, 4.1, and
                  4.7 indicators began to change color, but the pH 3.3 and 3.7
                  indicators remained unchanged for months. For comparison,
                  samples were removed and exposed to ammonia vapor to return
                  them to their initial color (for a short time). Similar
                  control samples in artists acrylic paint did not change color
                  at all. This demonstrates that oil paint becomes acidic within
                  a short period of time ([[Hackney 2020]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The acidic nature of dried oil paint is the reason why artists
                  do not paint directly on canvas but instead protect it with a
                  coat of glue size. The application of an oil ground or paint
                  on top of this water-soluble size layer produces many of the
                  structural and mechanical problems that we have to deal with.
                  A hot glue size will engulf the canvas, but when applied cold
                  it can accumulate on the canvas surface ([[Morgan et al.
                  2012]]). If and when a glue size cracks, its barrier
                  properties are reduced and volatile breakdown products (VOCs)
                  may reach the canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Similarly, if we add a consolidating or lining adhesive that
                  can become acidic on oxidation, the canvas will be exposed to
                  more rapid deterioration. These arguments suggest more
                  research is needed into both conservation adhesives and ways
                  of achieving adequate deacidification of canvas ([[Hackney,
                  Townsend, and Wyplosz 1996]]; [[Ryder 1986]]).

                  The concentration in air is not in itself a measure of
                  reaction rate, but it shows that more molecules are available
                  to react. Below 0.5 AER (air exchange rate), the rate of
                  off-gassing of acetic acid, both from the packaging and (some)
                  from the object, exceeds the combined leakage rate and rate of
                  deposition or reaction, the latter being slow processes. When
                  reactive molecules collide, only a small proportion react, but
                  in these circumstances trapped pollution molecules can collide
                  many times and will eventually react. The introduction of
                  sacrificial adsorbers or reactants might therefore be useful,
                  provided they are placed close to the object.

                  There is still plenty to do, but at last we know that we can
                  build on a growing body of knowledge. We still need to turn
                  this knowledge resource into genuine expertise and practical
                  conservation experience. We also need to embed in our minds
                  the concept of preventing deterioration, which will be
                  appreciated by future practitioners who will be still
                  addressing the same ethical issues. The Conserving Canvas
                  symposium provided a useful forum to take stock of recent
                  progress and to assess its contribution to the development of
                  an agreed way forward.

                  Paintings on canvas are composite structures with mechanical
                  properties that are difficult to characterize due to many
                  complicating issues: the wide range of artist materials and
                  techniques, which vary by region and time; the changing
                  properties of materials with age and environmental exposure;
                  and the addition of conservation treatments. Paintings are
                  also composed of viscoelastic materials, which means that
                  properties such as stiffness and extensibility are time and
                  temperature dependent. This large matrix of variables makes it
                  impossible to characterize the behavior of all paintings in
                  the same way that an engineer might describe a distinct
                  structure under a narrow window of conditions and boundary
                  constraints. Valuable information is instead derived from
                  materials testing of representative samples, development of
                  simplified models, and expert knowledge from past successes
                  and failures. As a result of the complexity, heuristics is
                  often applied in conservation treatments. This paper provides
                  a generalized overview of the mechanical behavior of paintings
                  in tension and describes trends that help to refine the
                  heuristics approach. The discussion is presented in the
                  context of a viscoelastic (time-dependent) material model
                  rather than elastic-plastic in order to highlight key
                  concepts.

                <p>
                  Those studying the mechanical behavior of artist paints and
                  painting structures will likely begin with the general
                  elastic-plastic stress-strain relationships often discussed in
                  introductory engineering texts. A classic diagram will label
                  elastic modulus, yield point, ultimate tensile strength, and
                  failure strain from a simple tensile test. The concepts then
                  become incredibly complex when delving deeper into the
                  response of polymeric materials under varying conditions. This
                  is particularly true for artists paints when considering the
                  influence of temperature, rate of deformation, moisture
                  content, additives to the polymer matrix, and many other
                  factors. To accurately characterize the small-strain behavior
                  of paint films over a wide range of conditions, it often
                  necessary to consider a linear viscoelastic material model
                  ([[Ferry 1980]]). Describing the large-strain response may
                  require adding hyperelasticity ([[Treloar 1975]]) for an
                  extension to a nonlinear viscoelastic material ([[Christensen
                  1982]]). An example of this approach was developed for acrylic
                  (latex) artists paints containing titanium dioxide ([[Hagan et
                  al. 2009]]), which provided parameters for finite element
                  analysis in software such as Abaqus. Calibrating such a
                  model—even for one material—is no easy task. It involves many
                  tests and numerical iteration to solve the best fit parameters
                  to experimental data, and simplifying assumptions still
                  remain.

                  When pigment particles are included in the polymer matrix of a
                  paint film the material becomes a particle-filled composite
                  with a viscoelastic matrix. Stiffness enhancement as a
                  function of particle volume concentration is described in many
                  micromechanics models; however, most give little consideration
                  to geometry effects. The Mori-Tanaka theory is particularly
                  useful since it considers the influence of particle shape and
                  orientation in addition to volume fraction ([[Tandon and Weng
                  1986]]). Clements and Mas extended this theory from an elastic
                  to linear viscoelastic matrix for small-strain modeling
                  ([[Clements and Mas 2001]]). The effects of particle shape and
                  concentration were highlighted for artists acrylic paints
                  using kaolin, calcium carbonate (aragonite), and titanium
                  dioxide as an inorganic phase in a recent study ([[Hagan et
                  al. 2011a]]). From this research, it is easy to imagine that
                  the properties of a paint layer may be different along a
                  brushstroke relative to the transverse direction, due to the
                  alignment of pigment particles with an aspect ratio not equal
                  to 1. The composite structure of a painting on canvas adds
                  further complexity given the layering of different materials
                  and boundary conditions at the stretcher. Common treatment
                  approaches, such as linings, add further variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is impractical to think that we can precisely understand
                  the mechanical behavior of paintings with so many influencing
                  factors, which additionally include chemical effects of the
                  aging process, the physical aging of polymers ([[Struik
                  1980]]), load cycling, fracture, and delamination
                  ([[Tantideeravit et al. 2013]]). While researchers work to
                  better understand and model these materials for risk analysis,
                  it is important to use the best information available in a
                  heuristic approach to resolving practical problems of the
                  moment. Waller and Michalski emphasized the value of
                  heuristics in preventative conservation:
                </p>
                <p>
                  A fully rational approach would require that all possibly
                  relevant information be obtained and used in arriving at a
                  decision or evaluation. The cost of—and time required for—a
                  fully rational decision is infinite. Instead, a conservator
                  evaluates, using heuristics (simple rules of thumb or
                  intuition), whether there is an advantage in seeking more
                  information before deciding whether a particular issue, such
                  as a risk to a collection, is significant or not. ([[Waller
                  and Michalski 2004, 6]])

                <p>
                  In “Toward a Definition of the Engineering Method,” Koen
                  defines <em>heuristics</em> as “anything that provides a
                  plausible aid or direction in the solution of a problem but is
                  in the final analysis unjustified, incapable of justification
                  and fallible. It is anything that is used to guide, discover
                  and reveal a possible, but not necessarily, correct way to
                  solve a problem” ([[Koen 1988, 308]]). An important comparison
                  is given to the different approaches of the scientific and
                  engineering methods. Koen also states that “the engineering
                  method is the use of engineering heuristics to cause the best
                  change in a poorly understood situation within the available
                  resources” ([[Koen 1988, 308]]). There is clearly a similarity
                  between the work of a heritage conservation professional and
                  an engineer, with respect to problem-solving under challenging
                  circumstances with many unknowns.

                  A pertinent example of the engineering method is found in the
                  renowned body of research by Mecklenburg related to the
                  mechanics of artist materials and the effects of the museum
                  environment. In the proceedings of the 1991 Art in Transit
                  meeting, Mecklenburg and Tumosa present findings that
                  highlight the tensile properties of artists paints as a
                  function of strain rate ([[Mecklenburg and Tumosa 1991]]). In
                  contrast, subsequent research gives descriptions of material
                  behavior that use an elastic-plastic (time-independent) model
                  ([[Mecklenburg 2005]]). Strain rate is fixed to a constant
                  value in mechanical tests to generate timely and practical
                  information on the effects of the museum environment without
                  the burden of viscoelastic theory.

                <p>
                  The aim of this paper is to revisit some key concepts in the
                  time-dependent mechanical behavior of paintings, as a
                  supplement to fundamental knowledge of mechanics. The concepts
                  relate to many of the treatment methods used in practice where
                  material behavior is altered by changing different parameters.
                  Detailed theory and test results are presented elsewhere;
                  therefore, focus is given to generalized trends for clarity. A
                  brief review of lining effects on stiffness and stress
                  relaxation of painting is also provided to complement a more
                  in-depth discussion regarding the Canadian Conservation
                  Institute (CCI) Lining Project ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]).

                  <em>Stress-strain curves</em>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  A stress-strain curve is derived from a simple tensile test,
                  and it is often used to characterize the mechanical properties
                  of painting materials. Force and displacement measurements are
                  converted to stress and strain in order to remove the effects
                  of sample geometry. The initial slope of a stress-strain curve
                  in uniaxial tension is a measure of stiffness called the
                  modulus of elasticity, <em>E</em>, or Young’s modulus.
                  Experiments in shear mode define the shear modulus, while
                  hydrostatic pressure gives the bulk modulus. For a
                  viscoelastic material, these elastic moduli are time
                  dependent, and the stress-strain relationship is nonlinear due
                  to polymer relaxation during the test.
                  <a href="#fig-2-1"><strong>Fig. 2.1</strong></a> shows
                  stress-strain curves from a series of tensile tests performed
                  on free films of an artist’s oil paint. The results highlight
                  that the modulus decreases with higher temperature and reduced
                  rate of deformation, while the failure strain increases.
                  Despite this trend, there is no simple relationship between
                  stiffness and failure strain for materials in general. A
                  material may be stiff and brittle or compliant and brittle.

                <p>
                  <a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>Fig. 2.2</strong></a> illustrates
                  the results of a tensile test with the time dimension added.
                  The first graph (<a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>fig. 2.2a</strong></a>) shows the strain history as millistrain versus time, and
                  indicates that the strain rate, <em>R</em>, is constant during
                  the constant speed test due to the low failure strain. At
                  higher strains, the strain rate would measurably decrease
                  during a constant speed test due to the changing length of the
                  sample. The second graph (<a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>fig. 2.2b</strong></a>) gives stress versus time, and the third (<a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>fig. 2.2c</strong></a>) presents a stress-strain curve. The latter shows a secant
                  modulus, <em>E~s~</em> (at strain ε&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.005), and the strain
                  at failure ε~f~. Secant modulus can be a useful measure of
                  stiffness due to nonlinearity caused by relaxation during the
                  tensile test.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  A relaxation test is another useful experiment for studying
                  time-dependent material properties, and it is particularly
                  relevant to canvas-supported paintings.
                  <a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>Fig. 2.3</strong></a> illustrates
                  the different parameters in a stress-relaxation test performed
                  on a Winsor and Newton Foundation White film. The first graph
                  (<a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>fig. 2.3a</strong></a>) shows the strain history as an initial loading ramp,
                  followed by constant strain during measurement of stress
                  relaxation. The second (<a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>fig. 2.3b</strong></a>) shows the loading ramp on a stress-strain curve, and a
                  vertical drop in stress during the constant strain segment.
                  <strong><a href="#fig-2-3">Fig. 2.3c</a></strong> gives the
                  stress relaxation process on a plot of stress versus time,
                  where it appears that stress is approaching equilibration
                  after a sharp initial drop. The final plot (<a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>fig. 2.3d</strong></a>) shows the same data on a log-log scale, and highlights that
                  the sample is still relaxing. The results also show similar
                  findings for a repeat test that was performed on the same
                  sample after a twenty-four-hour recovery period. During cyclic
                  load testing on viscoelastic materials, it is important to
                  consider strain history and its effects on repeated
                  measurements.

                  of tension (kN/m) versus time after a fixed strain was applied
                  to each sample ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]). The initial
                  sharp spike is caused by the rapid initial strain (see
                  <a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>figs. 2.3b and c</strong></a>), which is followed by a quick decay in tension due to
                  stress relaxation. The model painting with a linen lining
                  shows no difference from the model painting (unlined) over the
                  measurement time scale. The sailcloth lining causes a uniform
                  vertical shift in tension due to the stiffness of the fabric,
                  which is constant over the sixty-hour period. An advantage of
                  the sailcloth lining is that its stiffness allows for a stable
                  increase in tension, with less strain imposed on the painting.
                  In fact, the strain could be reduced to roughly half and still
                  maintain a similar tension to the model painting in the
                  experimental time scale. The wax resin lining also shows a
                  strong vertical shift due to the wax stiffness; however, it
                  also exhibits relaxation characteristics.

                  The addition of relative humidity (RH) fluctuations in
                  <a href="#fig-2-4"><strong>fig. 2.4</strong></a> highlights
                  some further trends in the lined painting response. Sailcloth
                  and linen have no effect on the response of the painting,
                  since the linings do not constrain the paint layers in the
                  direction of applied tension—that is, painting and lining are
                  free to shift across one another. In contrast, the wax lining
                  impregnates the canvas and constrains the paint layers from
                  shrinking or swelling due to contact with the supporting
                  layers of the painting. The paint layers still respond to RH
                  fluctuations; however, the wax adds surface constraint that
                  prevents movement and a subsequent change in tension measured
                  at the ends of the sample. A more in-depth discussion of the
                  CCI Lining Project is provided by Daly Hartin and colleagues
                  ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]); therefore, the following
                  discussion provides more general information regarding the
                  viscoelastic behavior of painting materials.

                  <em>Time-temperature superposition</em>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Over a wide range of test conditions, it is impractical to
                  summarize tensile data from a viscoelastic material with
                  stress-strain curves. It is also not feasible to measure the
                  full relaxation behavior from glassy to rubbery—a process
                  occurring over many decades—at one temperature, due to
                  equipment limitations and time constraints. In
                  <a href="#fig-2-1"><strong>fig. 2.1</strong></a>, it is clear that a relationship exists between strain rate
                  and temperature, since increasing the rate by an order of
                  magnitude is equivalent to decreasing temperature by 10°C.
                  This implies that time-temperature superposition (TTS) is a
                  potential tool for efficiently summarizing data ({Williams,
                  Landel, and Ferry 1955}). To illustrate this method,
                  <a href="#fig-2-5"><strong>fig. 2.5a</strong></a> shows a
                  simplified summary of modulus values at three temperatures and
                  four strain rates within a practical test window. This test
                  window is bounded by equipment limitations and practical time
                  available for data collection.
                  <a href="#fig-2-5"><strong>Fig. 2.5b</strong></a> shows the
                  result of fixing data at a chosen reference temperature,
                  <em>T~ref~</em> = 20°C, and horizontally shifting data at the
                  other temperatures to line up as a single master curve. The
                  result shows a shift from glassy to rubbery behavior over a
                  broader scale than the experiments allowed in direct
                  measurement. Tabulated results of the horizontal shift factor
                  versus temperature allow one to create a master curve at any
                  <em>T~ref~</em> of interest within data limits. Defining
                  <em>T~ref~</em> at the glass transition temperature,
                  <em>T~g~</em>, would also allow comparison with theoretical
                  functions, and possible extrapolation to temperatures beyond
                  the test conditions. There are many reasons why the simple TTS
                  method may not work for certain materials; however, it is a
                  powerful tool when it does.
                </p>

                  It is helpful to consider practical situations where the
                  viscoelastic properties are of importance. As a simple
                  example,
                  <a href="#fig-2-6"><strong>fig. 2.6a</strong></a> shows a
                  schematic of a broken and curled flake of paint that is
                  deformed back into the plane of the painting. The radius of
                  curvature (<em>r</em>) and film thickness (<em>h</em>) are
                  labeled simply to highlight that it is possible to estimate
                  the strain rate from a few parameters and define the time
                  scale of the applied deformation. Rolling or unrolling a
                  canvas painting is another similar and geometrically simple
                  example. In <a href="#fig-2-6"><strong>fig. 2.6b</strong></a>, the stiffness reduction caused by decreasing the rate of
                  deformation is shown as the path from point A to point B along
                  the master curve. In contrast, path A→C indicates the effect
                  of keeping the same strain rate but using higher temperature
                  to shift the master curve horizontally. The higher temperature
                  accelerates the polymer relaxation and leads to a lower
                  stiffness at a given strain rate. The horizontal shift may
                  also be caused by a plasticizing effect, such as an increase
                  in moisture content ([[Maksimov, Mochalov, and Urzhumtsev
                  1972]]). Path A→D shows a final example from the combined
                  effect of decreasing the rate of deformation while also
                  increasing temperature. Care should, of course, be taken when
                  increasing temperature and moisture content, since extremes
                  may cause unwanted effects beyond the simple relaxation
                  process described here.

                  The concepts discussed in this section are often studied using
                  a technique called dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)
                  ([[Nielsen and Landel 1994]]). This can rapidly give modulus
                  data as a function of temperature and frequency using a single
                  sample, and also show transition regions. Experiments
                  involving tensile tests are typically used when the
                  large-strain response, or failure properties, are of interest.

                <p>
                  The purpose of using tensile test data in studies of artists
                  paints is due to the interest in characterizing their
                  large-strain response, particularly the failure criteria as a
                  function of time and temperature. The related research work of
                  Thor Smith in the 1960s is of interest since it shows the
                  application of TTS to the ultimate properties of plastics and
                  elastomers. Smith clearly summarizes an important finding in
                  one of his many papers on this topic:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The ultimate tensile properties (the stress at break σ~b~,
                    and the corresponding extension ratio λ~b~) vary markedly
                    with the temperature and with the stress-time or strain-time
                    history prior to rupture. Considerable evidence indicates
                    that data obtained at different temperatures can often be
                    superposed to give master curves which show the variation of
                    σ~b~ and λ~b~ over many decades of time at a fixed
                    temperature. Further, the temperature shift factor is the
                    same—or nearly the same—as that used to superpose
                    viscoelastic data representing small-deformation behavior.
                    In other words, the same molecular parameters which
                    influence chain mobility, thus the time and temperature
                    dependence of linear viscoelastic response, also have a
                    controlling effect on the time and temperature dependence of
                    the ultimate tensile properties. ([[Smith 1965, 275]])

                  Recent studies on artists paints have highlighted the
                  application of this approach for generating master curves of
                  failure strains from tensile data.
                  <a href="#fig-2-7"><strong>Fig. 2.7a</strong></a> shows a
                  generalized illustration of a failure envelope created using a
                  similar approach to that shown for modulus data (see
                  <a href="#fig-2-5"><strong>fig. 2.5</strong></a>). The path to point A results in failure before reaching the
                  target strain at the defined strain rate. Reducing the strain
                  rate avoids failure for the path to point B, which is outside
                  of the failure envelope.
                  <a href="#fig-2-7"><strong>Fig. 2.7b</strong></a> shows the
                  path to point C outside of the failure envelope due to a
                  horizontal shift of the master curve from a temperature
                  increase or possibly a plasticizing effect (e.g., increased
                  moisture content). Combining higher temperature and reduced
                  strain rate locates point D even further from the failure
                  line.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This concept of a failure strain mastercurve is also shown in
                  figure 2.8 using tensile data from two artists paint films at
                  <em>T~ref~</em> = 20°C ({Hagan 2017}). The acrylic paint film
                  (<a href="#fig-2-8"><strong>fig. 2.8a</strong></a>) shows a considerably larger combination of strains and
                  strain rates that avoid failure compared to the oil paint (<a href="#fig-2-8"><strong>fig. 2.8b</strong></a>). This illustrates why cracking of acrylics latex paints is
                  much less common than traditional oils over a wide range of
                  conditions.

                <p>
                  An overview of the viscoelastic properties of artists painting
                  materials was provided to highlight important trends in their
                  mechanical behavior. Example tensile test and stress
                  relaxation data were presented for paint films and lined
                  painting samples respectively. These data showed a time and
                  temperature dependence on measured stiffness and failure
                  strains. For lined painting samples, stress-relaxation data
                  indicated clear differences in the response of different
                  treatment methods. The sailcloth lining showed value in
                  maintaining consistent tension over time, potentially reducing
                  the amount of strain on the painting for a given tension.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The concepts were further developed through a discussion of
                  the time-temperature superposition principle and the creation
                  of master curves of stiffness and failure strains. This
                  technique can effectively summarize properties over a broad
                  time scale and may be referenced at a temperature of interest.
                  The master curves were used to illustrate how stiffness and
                  failure strains are manipulated by changing the rate of
                  deformation, temperature, or moisture content. In practice, it
                  is not possible to know the shape of these curves for the wide
                  variety of materials found in paintings; however, an
                  understanding of the trends in material behavior is important
                  when applying heuristics to treatment methods.

                  This paper discusses the situation in Denmark before the
                  Greenwich conference on lining of canvas paintings and how the
                  subsequent period of fifteen to twenty years was filled with
                  curiosity, eagerness to try out new ways and ideas, testing of
                  methods and materials, contemplating failures, building of new
                  and glorious equipment—and a longing for better understanding
                  of treatments and the structural behavior of the paintings. In
                  the 1990s, the focus gradually changed. Interventions became
                  more limited, techniques and materials used changed, and
                  development of new treatment methods and materials was
                  deemphasized, while better understanding of the structural
                  behavior of canvas painting and its consequences came to the
                  forefront through increased scientific study of the subject.

                <p>
                  The paintings conservation community in Denmark in the
                  mid-twentieth century, as in many other countries, was
                  composed of, on one hand, individual practitioners working
                  privately for smaller collections and museums, and for
                  historic buildings, and on the other, a few conservators
                  working at larger institutions, primarily museums, in
                  permanent positions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Painting conservators considered themselves craftsmen. Most
                  had a background in the house painting craft<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  or were trained artists from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine
                  Arts School of Painting. Training as painting conservators
                  usually followed an apprenticeship in a conservation studio or
                  work in historic buildings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  House painting or artistic training constituted the background
                  for the approach to treatments, choice of materials, and
                  recipes for treatment. This produced a somewhat conservative
                  approach, based on generations of experience, but it was
                  sometimes open to new approaches or novel materials. For
                  example, newly available commercial materials were adopted,
                  and after the Second World War, internships with and visits by
                  a generation of young conservators to conservation studios
                  across Europe provided inspiration. In this way, for example,
                  in the 1950s, the idea of simple material analysis and
                  photographic documentation gradually found its way to Denmark
                  from Belgium’s Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage
                  (KIK-IRPA) ([[Coremans 1953]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Conservators, in general, mainly undertook treatments without
                  making note of methods and materials, although some books and
                  journals about methods and materials did exist. Danish
                  conservators could draw on a tradition of apprenticeship going
                  back to the early nineteenth century ([[Scharff 1998]];
                  [[Scharff 2000]]), including some treatment descriptions
                  written in Danish ([[Greve 1855]]). Recipe books for house
                  painters or artists were also available, as well as books on
                  gilding and varnishing. Danish painting conservators in the
                  mid-twentieth century knew about and practiced the main trends
                  and techniques of structural treatments from the nineteenth
                  century onwards, including glue-based, glue-paste, and
                  wax-resin treatments, though the latter were not practiced
                  very much until the 1960s, when they were in regular use at
                  the Statens Museum for Kunst (Royal Danish Museum of Fine
                  Arts) ([[Andersen et al. 2014]]). Structural treatments were
                  divided between primary treatments (first linings), and
                  secondary retreatments (relinings), and (much less frequently)
                  more radical treatments such as transfers or marouflage.

                  This aim could well stand as the general effect of the
                  Greenwich conference on the established painting conservation
                  field in the 1970s and onwards and describes the impact on
                  young conservators making their way into the field. A number
                  of publications have dealt with the conference and its major
                  influence, and they often discuss historical developments
                  preceding and following the conference, for example, the
                  introduction to the 2003 postprint publication ([[Villers
                  2003a]]), most recently Hackney’s overview book
                  <em>On Canvas</em> ([[Hackney 2020]]), as well as elsewhere
                  ([[Bomford 2017]]; [[Burnstock 2017]]; [[Hackney 2012]]).
                  Given this background, this paper focuses on information
                  preceding the Greenwich conference that is relevant to
                  developments in Denmark, during the 1970s in particular—a
                  decade with a number of defining events in paintings
                  conservation that have had a lasting impact for the future.

                  The experiences and events of the 1960s formed the immediate
                  background. A new generation of postwar conservators with new
                  experience and ideas gained from abroad were in a position to
                  carry out various structural reforms in their institutions—and
                  to review the approach to treatments followed in most painting
                  conservation studios in Denmark.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For a while in the 1960s, wax-resin treatments were seen as a
                  major improvement and were widely used in combination with the
                  innovative equipment: the new vacuum hot table ([[Andersen et
                  al. 2014]]). Another milestone occurred when the river Arno
                  inundated a major part of the medieval city of Florence and
                  its artwork. Subsequently, conservators from abroad, including
                  eighteen painting conservators from the Nordic countries,
                  participated in the immediate rescue and undertook
                  conservation and restoration treatments ([[Plahter 1999]]).
                  The disaster itself—and the observation that treatment
                  approaches between conservators differed vastly—caused many in
                  the assembled conservation community to reconsider materials,
                  methods, and approaches and to realize that for the future of
                  conservation it would be essential to obtain a more consistent
                  entry to the profession.

                  Formal educational programs could be one of the means, but
                  only few existed at that time in Europe and the Americas. In
                  Denmark, a government commission was formed in 1965. In 1969,
                  it produced a report<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  aimed at establishing new legislation on the protection of
                  heritage in Denmark. The report considered a revision of the
                  conservation strategy and improved conservation facilities in
                  Danish museums, as well as plans to establish an educational
                  program that would supply the museums and the private market
                  with qualified conservation staff. Concurrently, UNESCO was
                  preparing the World Heritage Convention,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  which was widely adopted in 1972 (including by Denmark) with a
                  broad impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Danish conservation community held seminars, lectures, and
                  courses on various subjects while awaiting the inauguration of
                  the School of Conservation, including the development of new
                  equipment and approaches and the testing of alternative
                  materials or methods. These were presented and discussed in
                  the Nordisk Konserverings Forbund (NKF), the IIC Nordic Group,
                  and at international forums including IIC and ICOM congresses,
                  and especially at the ICOM Committee for the Care of
                  Paintings—later to become part of the ICOM Committee for
                  Conservation. The proposal by Percival-Prescott at ICOM-CC in
                  Venice in 1975 to halt lining treatments pending a full review
                  ([[Percival-Prescott 1975]]) was discussed as well, but it did
                  not have a lasting effect in Denmark. It did, however,
                  encourage consideration and testing of alternative and perhaps
                  less intrusive treatment methods.

                  In 1973, Steen Bjarnhof, head of the Statens Museum for Kunst
                  (Royal Danish Museum of Fine Arts) conservation studio,
                  answered a questionnaire distributed by Stephen Rees-Jones,
                  head of the technology department of the Courtauld Institute
                  of Art, University of London, in advance of the Greenwich and
                  ICOM-CC 1975 conferences. His answers<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  revealed the conservation studio’s use of traditional
                  materials and methods and noted the deficiencies of wax-resin
                  linings: canvases becoming slack after wax-resin lining,
                  hygroscopicity even in wax-resin linings. Bjarnhof also
                  reported on experiments with EVA dispersion using
                  “laminations”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  and further information about the experiments and
                  developments, such as those described by Hacke in the 1960s
                  ([[Hacke 1963–64]]) and Bøgh and Ketnath’s experiments with
                  EVA as adhesive ([[Bøgh, Ketnath, and Thorvildsen 1975]];
                  [[Ketnath and Bøgh 1975]]). In 1974, Bjarnhof and other Danish
                  paintings conservators attended the Greenwich conference.

                  Real Changes—The School of Conservation Is Established
                </h2>
                <p>
                  At the time of the Greenwich conference, the Royal Danish
                  Academy of Fine Arts School of Conservation had been
                  functioning for about a year. The founding of the educational
                  program in 1973 resulted in a major, planned change to the
                  field of paintings conservation in Denmark—not at first,
                  perhaps, but gradually over the following years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I entered the paintings conservation program as part of the
                  third admission of undergraduate students in conservation, in
                  late August 1977. There had been many challenges in setting up
                  a training program during the first four years, but the class
                  of 1977 found a three-year educational program with quite a
                  structured curriculum. We attended lectures, undertook a lot
                  of practical work and exercises, and practiced extensive
                  documentation, including photographic and X-ray techniques.
                  Microscopy was the main analytical technique available to
                  study a painting, its surfaces, and layered structure. The
                  thorough process of documenting observations, reflections,
                  descriptions, and errors was considered a major leap forward
                  in the professionalization of the field and underscored the
                  importance of compiling empirical knowledge for future use.
                  Coursework was based on established treatment techniques, but
                  we were also introduced new techniques and materials as
                  directed by teachers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The available literature was limited. Descriptions of
                  established techniques were provided by copies of the small
                  Greenwich offprints, including the useful “Handbook of Terms”
                  (see [[Percival-Prescott and Lewis 2003]]). Bent Hacke and
                  others presented new developments, discussing the outcomes of
                  the Greenwich conference and the innovations of Mehra and
                  Berger. Hacke had experimented with suction-table techniques
                  (termed <em>low-pressure techniques</em>) since the 1960s
                  ([[Hacke 1963–64]]; [[Hacke 1976]]; [[Hacke 1978]]), and in
                  1979 the School of Conservation received its first
                  custom-built low-pressure table, which he had designed. Hacke
                  held a seminar in September of that year for the students on
                  suction-table techniques, in which we tried out the equipment
                  and discussed “requirements” or options for treatments. These
                  requirements were similar to those proposed by Mehra (see
                  [Andersen essay
                  21](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/paper-21))
                  and consisted of a set of principles, requirements, options,
                  and methods guided by a philosophy that had formed over the
                  previous years and constituted the basis for the equipment’s
                  design as well as the techniques employed. The seminar caused
                  quite a stir, as the new equipment, the new techniques, and
                  the whole approach offered interesting alternatives to the
                  techniques we had tried during the previous years of
                  coursework—and had, we understood, been intensively discussed
                  at Greenwich.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We had also begun to follow conservators who were beginning to
                  publish post-Greenwich information on canvas painting behavior
                  and its response during treatment. Everything taken together
                  though, to be honest, made us feel somewhat lost at times. We
                  were trying to understand the real impact of the more
                  established techniques as well as understand how the new
                  techniques worked. It was obvious that more information or
                  knowledge was needed, but we tried to follow the publications
                  and the views expressed, though they at times conflicted
                  somewhat with the views of our teachers and tutors. There was
                  a clear trend towards less intervention, or even no
                  intervention, raising the question of whether to treat or not
                  to treat a given painting. And if treatment was preferable,
                  how were we to approach it?

                  The Thesis Proposal
                </h3>
                <p>
                  To illustrate the introduction of the new techniques for the
                  conservation community in Denmark, I have retrieved my
                  bachelor thesis report, which was based on thesis work done
                  over six months in 1979 and 1980 ([[Scharff 1980]]). It may
                  serve as an example of the knowledge and understanding used at
                  the time for making decisions—from a student’s point of view.
                  The thesis subject was a small seventeenth-century painting in
                  rather deteriorated condition that had been lined with glue
                  paste. Structurally, the lining no longer served a function,
                  the paint layers were cupped all over the surface and the
                  varnish had become opaque. Having established and documented
                  the condition and the problems, the student was to propose a
                  treatment: either an established method using well-known
                  materials, where arguments were less necessary, as it was the
                  normal choice; or one of the new, somewhat experimental (not
                  well established) methods, which would need to be supported by
                  arguments in its favor and references to publications and the
                  recommendations they made. To seriously propose not to treat
                  was not yet an option for a student thesis. My suggestion, to
                  try a new approach, was accepted, and I began a quest for the
                  literature and arguments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to a few 1950s publications on the subject of the
                  then-new hot tables and vacuum hot tables (e.g., [[Ruhemann
                  1952]]<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>), select publications from the 1960s provided critical views
                  on the new lining techniques and specific issues of vacuum hot
                  table treatment practice ([[Brachert 1965]]; [[Linard 1965]];
                  [[Straub 1965]]). Alternative solutions to the drawbacks of
                  established or newer lining techniques were published
                  ([[Berger 1965]]; [[Berger 1966]]; ([[Etchinson 1969]];
                  [[Hacke 1963–64]]; [[Wales 1968]]). Some publications took a
                  different approach that was new to me: attempting to define
                  some of the deterioration mechanisms (e.g., [[Keck 1969]]),
                  indirectly pointing toward a different or better practice in
                  treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The more recent part of the literature review, through the
                  1970s, was easier, as most of the literature (not least the
                  Greenwich conference papers), were relatively accessible and
                  had been recently discussed in the student group. Alternative
                  structural treatments appeared in publications from
                  international organizations such as IIC and ICOM-CC and in
                  national organizations like the NKF and the American Institute
                  for Conservation; a few authors presented ongoing work
                  throughout the decade in journals or at conferences. While
                  some publications were based on a more scientific approach,
                  most were still based on assumptions, a few experiments,
                  practical experience, and tacit knowledge, making it somewhat
                  difficult for students to evaluate the decision making, as
                  they lacked experience and had few examples of a more
                  stringent approach.

                  Examination of the thesis painting, the literature review, and
                  my considerations resulted in a treatment proposal that was
                  primarily based on treatment philosophy and techniques related
                  to Mehra and Hacke—their publications as well as the lectures
                  and workshops with Hacke.

                  The alternative “low-pressure table” equipment to be used, the
                  “lamination” adhesives and technique, and the underlying
                  philosophy rested on a new approach that Mehra and Hacke
                  shared to a considerable degree, but not entirely. There were
                  significant differences between the two, and it is interesting
                  to compare Mehra’s statements (treatment options) from 1972
                  (see [Andersen in this
                  publication](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/paper-21))
                  and his subsequent publications in the 1970s with Hacke’s
                  statements published during the same decade ([[Hacke 1976]];
                  [[Hacke 1978]]), and compiled in 1979 ([<strong>fig. 3.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-1);
                  [<strong>table 3.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/table-3-1)).
                  The second column of table 3.1 presents a set of options for
                  proper lining treatment that came out of a seminar Hacke held
                  at the School of Conservation in September 1979. The list was
                  compiled by the students based on the seminar and Hacke’s
                  previous publications ({Hacke 1976}; {Hacke 1978}).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the thesis, both Mehra and Hacke are referred to, but only
                  the Hacke-inspired (unpublished) statement is listed as an
                  appendix to the thesis. In [<strong>table 3.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/table-3-1)
                  the Mehra and the Hacke statements are shown side by side with
                  the original numbering. They appear mostly to agree, although
                  some statements appear in different order and not all appear
                  in both lists. The main difference is probably regarding the
                  use of heat or raised humidity or liquid water in the
                  treatments, along with a difference of opinion as to its
                  consequences. In the main thesis text, I summed up my opinion
                  regarding each of the statements, listing which option I chose
                  to follow in a condition list ([<strong>table 3.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/table-3-2)).
                  My condition list was introduced with acknowledgments of the
                  ideal nature of the list and the fact that it would probably
                  not be possible to fulfill all of the options. Likewise, I
                  expected that as the treatment progressed the selection of
                  treatment methods and materials most likely would involve
                  compromises compared with the ideal situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A closer look at the treatment options for the thesis work
                  reveals that item 1 (reversibility) was qualified as “optimal”
                  rather than “full” as Mehra has it. At the student seminar the
                  unrealistic option of full reversibility was discussed, while
                  attempting optimal reversibility was accepted to include a
                  possible failure situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Item 2 (“material identity”) was deselected as a treatment
                  condition to avoid material identity between the natural glue
                  materials in the painting and an aqueous animal glue commonly
                  used as a treatment constituent in consolidation. The use of
                  aqueous glue would counter the demands of items 4 and 8. It is
                  further noted in the thesis that item 9 (minimal increase of
                  weight) was also deselected as it was assumed to be of minor
                  significance on the small painting that was the designated
                  thesis subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mehra’s conditions 4, flexibility, and 5, to fully avoid heat,
                  was not included. Nor was Mehra’s term
                  <em>compatible</em> (item 8) used in the arguments for or
                  against the selected materials. In all, where the Mehra and
                  Hacke prescriptions differed, the treatment proposal had a
                  greater affinity with the Hacke statements, for example, by
                  keeping heat as low as possible but not fully ruling it out. A
                  prominent principle listed by Hacke (item 7 in [<strong>table 3.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/table-3-1))
                  was that each treatment step be kept discrete, and Mehra
                  promotes the principle as well in his Venice ICOM publication
                  ([[Mehra 1975a]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The treatment proposal could be seen as trying alternate means
                  to counter the more traditional treatment solutions and their
                  inherent problems, not least by including the new treatment
                  options employing a low-pressure/suction table. In this way,
                  the proposal followed up on the many discussions that came out
                  of the Greenwich conference and subsequent experiments,
                  discussions, and publications that the followed over the next
                  five to six years.

                  Thesis Outcome—Results of the Planned Treatment
                </h3>
                <p>
                  As expected, the actual treatment as described in the thesis
                  did not turn out fully as planned. The final treatment ended
                  up as a selection of compromises to some extent, where some of
                  the ideal demands had to be partly diluted, deselected, or
                  dismissed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For instance, the application of facing paper with an acrylic
                  solution that had been proposed did not work as planned. At
                  the suggestion of the tutors, it was replaced with use of a
                  thin layer of wax-resin paste applied at a temperature of no
                  more than 45°C. In the end, however (according to the thesis
                  documentation), a temperature of 65°C had to be used to ensure
                  the adhesion of the facing paper—thus compromising the idea of
                  keeping the temperature as low as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Subsequent removal of the previous glue-paste lining went well
                  ([<strong>figs. 3.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-2)
                  and
                  [<strong>3.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-3))
                  and so did the flattening procedure. A humidification chamber
                  setup on the low-pressure table was used, with a tabletop
                  temperature of 35°C and pressure at 50 millibars (mbar). To
                  avoid liquid water in the structure, consolidation was done
                  with an acrylic solution, and after solvent evaporation the
                  consolidant was “activated” by heating the painting on the
                  low-pressure table at 100 mbar and 42°C. The linen lining
                  canvas was coated with a layer of thickened acrylic
                  dispersion, and after a drying period, the dry acrylic layer
                  on the lining canvas and the consolidated painting were
                  activated at 100 mbar and 42°C. After cooling the proper
                  lamination was obtained, basically following directions by
                  Hacke and Ketnath ([[Hacke 1976]]; [[Ketnath 1976]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A final, unplanned step in the structural treatment was added
                  at the suggestion of the tutor to remedy a certain canvas
                  structure enhancement and moating—most likely stemming from
                  the previous glue-paste lining. The prescription was a final
                  treatment of the painting, face down on a vacuum hot table at
                  500 mbar and 42°C. The resulting painting surface after this
                  treatment did not exhibit any canvas structure at all, and the
                  painting was ready for the restoration part of the thesis
                  project. However, neither the facedown treatment nor the 500
                  mbar pressure was fully in line with the ideas of the planned
                  treatment. Nevertheless, the restoration went well, and in the
                  summer of 1980 I obtained my bachelor’s degree in conservation
                  and went on to the master’s program.

                  Consequences—Evaluation of a Treatment and Its Consequences
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In general, it is interesting to note how much the new
                  treatment concepts and material choices influenced the
                  treatment design of the thesis work for me and my fellow
                  students, and how little actual knowledge about the impact of
                  the treatment and the choice of materials to use was available
                  to us at the time. Most choices were based on the then-current
                  “demands” or “recommendations,” but they were also partly
                  based on the critique of bygone treatments and materials as
                  discussed in publications during the 1970s and especially
                  after the Greenwich conference in 1974. The Greenwich
                  offprints were also mostly based on assumptions, common sense,
                  and empirical and tacit knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was also interesting to see how treatment inadequacies or
                  shortcomings in the conglomerate of new techniques and
                  materials were addressed by reverting to better known
                  techniques and materials during the thesis
                  treatments—eventually once again reverting to empirical and
                  tacit knowledge. However, this was to gradually change over
                  the ensuing ten to twenty years. At the time of the first
                  thesis, to treat or not to treat was perhaps not yet a mature
                  question to pose, but it would turn out to be an issue of
                  increasing debate in the next couple of decades.

                  Further Developments—The 1980s and Onwards
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In the 1980s, after the relatively new suction table was added
                  as new equipment at the School of Conservation and other
                  conservation studios in Denmark, conservators across the
                  country began to further develop the equipment, as it seemed a
                  useful tool for the treatment of many canvas paintings. The
                  first suction table at the school was rather small, so an
                  all-aluminum suction frame was developed based on the design
                  of larger wooden frames at the National Museum of Denmark and
                  the Museum of Fine Arts. It was constructed to fit the surface
                  of the larger vacuum hot table and could utilize its heat
                  capacity if need be. This made it possible to treat larger
                  paintings with suction table techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Construction of minisuction equipment was the result of one
                  student thesis during these years ([[Mitka 1985]]). A
                  different student thesis included the construction of a large
                  suction table ([[Petéus 1984]]), and another large,
                  experimental table was built by Mitka at the School of
                  Conservation. All these tables had built-in heating capacity,
                  and the latter included conditioned air which flowed in from
                  below or via a chamber above the painting during treatment on
                  the suction table. Built-in sensors enabled the user to follow
                  and record temperature and humidity on paper tape.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Similar new—and even larger—low-pressure tables were designed
                  and built ad hoc for special projects in situ in manor houses
                  or for general use in the Danish conservation studios.
                  Comparable activities took place in many countries, with
                  either in-house designed equipment or commercial
                  suction-tables ([[Reeve 1984]]). The interest in the
                  techniques and equipment (see [Coddington in this
                  publication](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/paper-20))
                  and the results of the construction and use of suction tables
                  were reported and discussed at conferences such as ICOM-CC,
                  including the 1984 ICOM-CC conference in Copenhagen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the following six years, summer schools on the subject were
                  organized at the School of Conservation (in collaboration with
                  ICCROM) to introduce and discuss suction-table techniques and
                  principles and making it possible for numerous participants
                  over the years to try out selected techniques ([<strong>fig. 3.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-4)).
                  Discussions were lively (<strong>[figs.
                    3.5](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-5)</strong>
                  and
                  [<strong>3.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-6))
                  and included technical and ethical debates on the specific
                  aspects of the techniques and the use of new materials. Such
                  topics included nap-bond acrylic dispersion-adhesives,
                  EVA-based adhesives (e.g., Beva 371), fiberglass cloth,
                  limited interventions, temperature, humidity, strip-linings,
                  loose-linings, and much more. In tune with the prevailing
                  discussions in paintings conservation in general, the idea of
                  how much treatment was really necessary—and if so, what
                  kind—was discussed as well, and Percival-Prescott’s 1974
                  concept of the lining cycle and whether to treat or not to
                  treat was a regular part of conversations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In parallel with the summer schools, a set of visual teaching
                  aids was being produced in collaboration with the Getty
                  Conservation Institute. The aim was to produce step-by-step
                  images of the recently developed lining techniques, along with
                  a detailed description of each step, as a didactic tool for
                  teachers in canvas paintings conservation. The aids were used
                  at each summer school and in regular courses at School of
                  Conservation before being finalized in 1990 ([[Scharff
                  1995]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The production of the aids turned out to be a real challenge,
                  since the treatment steps needed to be explained and, if
                  possible, supported by recent knowledge. As the understanding
                  of canvas paintings’ reactions to treatments was very limited
                  at the beginning of the 1980s—and only gradually became
                  supported by publications during the second half of the decade
                  and beyond—it was not always possible to present a
                  well-supported argument for some of the treatment steps or
                  material choices. However, the process for developing the aids
                  was designed to let any teacher using a given treatment add
                  new and relevant information as it became available, as well
                  as to discuss the logic of the approaches with the students or
                  to dismiss some treatment steps as obsolete. In this way, the
                  treatment rationale and background for the treatments could be
                  updated.

                  While some parts of these teaching aids appear outdated today,
                  thirty years later, other parts remain useful, and the whole
                  set serves as both a legacy and documentation of a major
                  evolution in the philosophy and practical approach to canvas
                  paintings conservation in the two decades following the
                  Greenwich conference.

                  Teaching in paintings conservation programs has changed in
                  many respects since the 1980s and 1990s. Less emphasis is now
                  placed on learning a complete set of treatment techniques in
                  favor of a greater concentration on principles and a better
                  understanding of the materials and structures that a painting
                  is composed of, with the aim of better understanding
                  deterioration mechanisms and the properties and impact of
                  treatments and associated materials. Experimental work plays
                  an increasing role, as it further enhances the understanding
                  of the concepts. Hopefully, it will have an impact on whether
                  the future profession concentrates mainly on hands-on
                  treatments or develops a more general approach to entire
                  collections.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The development of a better scientific understanding of the
                  behavior of canvas painting structures themselves, as well as
                  treatment techniques and materials, took place in parallel
                  with the practical experiments and experiences among a limited
                  number of researchers and conservators. Results were published
                  and discussed at conferences, not least at the ICOM-CC working
                  group on structural treatment of canvas paintings that was
                  active at the second half of the 1980s and into the 1990s, as
                  presented in more recent accounts ([[Hackney 2020]]). In
                  particular, publications from Hedley, Mecklenburg, and
                  Michalski provided new insights; Hedley regularly published on
                  the behavior of canvas paintings with a special interest in
                  studying the interaction with humidity ([[Hedley 1993]]).
                  Mecklenburg and Michalski provided new and valuable insights
                  in painting structure behavior, for example at the Art in
                  Transit conference and subsequent publication ([[Mecklenburg
                  1991]]; [[Michalski 1991]]). Such advances originated from or
                  gradually fed into the educational programs in Denmark and
                  abroad, in collaboration with the steadily growing group of
                  practitioners with strong interests in canvas behavior.
                  Without continued research supporting and advancing the field,
                  it would have been impossible to gain a proper understanding
                  of the structure of a painting, its mechanics, and the impact
                  of environment and treatments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The interest in and experiments with new equipment, methods,
                  and materials in the 1980s that resulted from recognizing the
                  need for changes in canvas conservation gradually faded away
                  as a different approach to canvas painting treatments evolved
                  and became accepted. The new approach placed more focus on
                  preventive means, perhaps following principles of more limited
                  interventions, and coincided with the growing popularity of
                  EVA-based adhesives and adhesive sheets and several proposed
                  nap-bond application techniques (although still using a
                  relatively high temperature of 65°C).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, gradually, as treatment methods evolved, a better
                  understanding of the impact of structural treatments emerged,
                  and interest in preventive conservation grew, an increasing
                  number of practitioners became more reluctant to carry out the
                  number of treatments that had been customary in the past.
                  Little by little practitioners began leaning toward the more
                  limited interventions that many have identified collectively
                  using the term <em>minimalism</em> (see, e.g., [[Ackroyd and
                  Villers 2003]]). The increasing impact of preventive
                  conservation and risk management/assessment ([[Antomarchi et
                  al. 2005]]) in decision-making may also influence the approach
                  to the preservation of canvas paintings in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While further development of treatment methods and materials
                  seems largely to have been on hold over the past twenty years,
                  research into canvas paintings’ material structure and
                  mechanics has increased: How is the structure affected by the
                  environment during exhibition or storage? What is the impact
                  of conservation treatments—past and present? A growing number
                  of conservators and scientists are working together in
                  national and international research groups, taking advantage
                  of the steadily growing availability of analytical equipment
                  and methods, including the use of computer modeling to predict
                  behavior. A steady increase in publications in the field also
                  provides everyone in conservation studios and conservation
                  students in educational institutions with an ever-expanding
                  trove of relevant information. Hopefully, in the future, all
                  of this will lead to a to better understanding of material
                  behavior and deterioration phenomena, and we will be able,
                  ultimately, to predict the future response of canvas paintings
                  under given conditions and develop better means to preserve
                  them—either by active treatment procedures or by preventive
                  measures—and thus maintain our cultural heritage for future
                  generations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, we may have passed the point where there were only two
                  options: to treat or not to treat at all. Perhaps the question
                  now should be whether to line or not to line. Luckily, the
                  advances in the field in practice, as well as research since
                  the Greenwich conference, have given us a sounder basis for
                  selecting better options to preserve canvas paintings.
                  Nonetheless, there is still much to learn, and we hope that is
                  will be conducted in the spirit of the Greenwich conference,
                  which laid the ground for nearly fifty years of progress in
                  canvas paintings conservation.

                  Since the 1970s, the Courtauld Institute of Art (CIA) and
                  Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG) (formerly the National Maritime
                  Museum [NMM]) have been at the forefront of developments in
                  lining methods, including research and practice using new
                  adhesives including PVA, Beva 371, and synthetic wax-resin.
                  The RMG worked closely with Stephen Rees Jones and Gerry
                  Hedley from the Technology Department of the Courtauld to
                  adopt their innovative methods, including lining using a
                  vacuum hot table and vacuum envelopes, working together to
                  develop the way paintings would be lined in the future. The
                  present study reexamines archival materials related to the
                  Greenwich Lining Conference and subsequent practical
                  treatments undertaken in the CIA and RMG in the 1970s and
                  1980s. The authors explore the impact of the conference on
                  contemporary practice, and a small group of case-study
                  paintings is presented to evaluate the success and longevity
                  of these treatments after forty to fifty years on display in

                  From the 1970s onwards, the National Maritime Museum (NMM),
                  now Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG), and Courtauld Institute of
                  Art (CIA) were at the forefront of UK developments in lining
                  methods and the use of modern adhesives. NMM conservator
                  Westby Percival-Prescott worked closely with Professor Stephen
                  Rees-Jones and Gerry Hedley at the Courtauld to adopt their
                  innovative methods, including the use of a vacuum hot table
                  and vacuum envelope for lining ([[Percival-Prescott 2003a]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As part of the Getty Foundation’s Conserving Canvas
                  initiative, CIA and RMG collaborated once again to explore
                  lining methods and our common history of lining. The first
                  part of this collaborative project invited an expert panel of
                  liners from the UK and Europe to review the condition of
                  seventeen paintings from the two collections that had received
                  structural treatment in the late twentieth century (see the
                  Appendix at the end of this paper).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  We were interested to assess the longevity of the modern
                  lining methods used in order to inform collections care for
                  the future. Alongside this work, and to establish the
                  structural conservation history of both institutions from the
                  1970s onwards, a survey of all treatment reports was
                  undertaken, and each institution’s conservators were
                  interviewed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of the seventeen paintings (see Appendix) examined by our
                  experts, the majority remained in excellent structural
                  condition, as might be expected, as the treatments were
                  between twenty and fifty years old. Reviewing the treatment
                  documentation alongside the paintings highlighted the change
                  in attitudes towards structural conservation in the ensuing
                  decades.

                  The NMM collection contains approximately four thousand
                  paintings. In 1960, Percival-Prescott joined the NMM and
                  founded the conservation department in the Royal Observatory
                  building ([[Bomford 2005]]). He was joined by Ronald
                  Chittenden, who focused solely on structural conservation, and
                  paintings conservator Gillian Lewis. Thanks to
                  Percival-Prescott’s intense interest in painting materials and
                  his passionate views on ethical methods of conservation, his
                  department built and developed an international reputation
                  ([[Bomford 2005]]). When asked by Dr. Greenhill, then director
                  of the NMM, for a research area that could culminate in a
                  large conference, Percival-Prescott put forward the idea of
                  the structural conservation of canvas paintings, with a
                  particular focus on lining. This was the origin of the
                  Comparative Lining Techniques conference, held in Greenwich,
                  April 23–25, 1974 ([[Percival-Prescott 2003a]]). The
                  conference had an extraordinary impact on the conservation
                  profession, and Percival-Prescott’s keynote speech, “The
                  Lining Cycle,” articulated the trend for minimalism in
                  structural treatment that still prevails today
                  ([[Percival-Prescott 2003b]]).

                  From 1970 to 1974, Percival-Prescott, Lewis, and Chittenden
                  travelled throughout Europe, the East Coast of America, and
                  Russia, to learn more about lining, meeting experts and
                  filming them at work. Upon return to the UK studios, they
                  experimented with the new techniques, adhesives, and fabrics
                  discovered abroad, and extensive (unpublished) peel tests were
                  undertaken in the Engineering Research department of the Royal
                  Naval College, a few of which still remain in the
                  Percival-Prescott archive at the Hamilton Kerr Institute.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>

                </h3>
                <p>
                  To understand the trends and patterns in the use of adhesives
                  and fabrics at NMM, treatment reports from 1963 to 2000 were
                  reviewed and the information collated. Out of the 2,023
                  reports consulted, 447 included structural treatment of some
                  sort (approximately 22% of all paintings treated).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The impact of the 1974 conference was evident in the treatment
                  data, but other factors influenced the types of structural
                  work undertaken. Chittenden’s retirement as a dedicated liner
                  in the early 1980s meant that his workload was absorbed into
                  the work of other paintings conservators in the studio:
                  Caroline Hampton and Sally Wakelin, who both joined in 1974,
                  and Elizabeth Hamilton-Eddy, who joined in 1978. The move to
                  the Feather’s Place conservation studios in 2000 resulted in
                  the loss of the hot-vacuum table due to lack of space, and
                  major structural treatments such as lining were sent out to
                  private studios.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When reviewing the treatment reports from 1965 to 2000, the
                  impact of these various factors was evident: the number of
                  linings diminishes, whereas strip-linings appear in 1974 and
                  quickly become a regular occurrence ([<strong>fig. 4.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-1)).
                  Similarly, a change in thinking was noticeable, for example,
                  in the introduction of other minimal or preventative
                  treatments, such as loose-lining and local reinforcement
                  (corners and edges, and tear-mending).

                </h3>
                <p>
                  In terms of adhesives used for lining and strip-lining, the
                  NMM shows a preference for a small number of adhesives and
                  techniques, which were refined into streamlined processes
                  ([<strong>fig. 4.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-2)).
                  Initially, wax-resin lining is the only method used. Linen was
                  used almost exclusively,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  and reports mention combinations of AW2 or dammar resin with
                  wax and elemi gum, or later, MS2 resin combined with wax,
                  colophony, and elemi.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  These linings were almost all done on the hot table, using the
                  prestretching technique and the vacuum envelope developed
                  in-house ([[Chittenden, Lewis, and Percival-Prescott 2003]]).
                  Chittenden’s reports were usually very brief, such as, “lined
                  in the usual way” or “lined with satisfactory results.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  From 1971 to 1973, five sturgeon glue linings were performed.
                  These are rather rare in the UK and drew upon the team’s
                  training from “masterly restorer Brianzev” in Russia
                  ([[Percival-Prescott 2003a|, viii]]). Reports for the 1971
                  treatment of George Knight’s
                  <em>Cleopatra’s Needle Being Brought to England,</em> 1877
                  (BHC0641), revealed that “sturgeon bladder adhesive” was
                  selected because the work was “painted upon a white ground and
                  of materials which would have yellowed and darkened had wax
                  been used.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  These linings were performed only prior to the conference and
                  were quickly abandoned; studio notes and treatment reports
                  convey the impression that the technique was difficult to
                  master.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beva 371 was used for both strip-lining and lining, combined
                  with a variety of fabrics ([figs.
                  4.2](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-2)
                  and
                  [4.3](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-3)).
                  Initially, the preference was for TenCate, a polyvinyl alcohol
                  fabric from the Netherlands, but this was gradually superseded
                  by polyester sailcloth, beginning in 1982, most likely
                  introduced to the NMM by the Courtauld. Linen was used on one
                  occasion with Beva for lining but more frequently for
                  strip-lining. Other materials were used more sporadically in
                  conjunction with Beva, including woven polypropylene and glass
                  fiber. These fabrics seem to have been used experimentally
                  around the time of the lining conference and were not
                  incorporated into usual practice. Glass fiber, introduced by
                  Pierre Boissonnas ([[Boissonnas 1961]]), was used over a
                  prolonged period (1973–81), in combination with wax-resin,
                  Beva, or Beva with added wax, to help produce transparent
                  linings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As surface deformations could not be addressed during a
                  wax-resin or Beva lining, they had to be treated beforehand.
                  The NMM developed the prestretching technique, first published
                  at the 1974 conference, to introduce tension and address
                  cupping and deformation out of plane ([[Chittenden, Lewis, and
                  Percival-Prescott 2003]]). This technique was used routinely
                  in the 1970s and 1980s.

                <p>
                  Loose-lining starts in the early 1970s, and sixteen paintings
                  were loose-lined in 1975 using either TenCate or Fabrene,
                  possibly in preparation for an exhibition. TenCate was used
                  until 1986, after which it was replaced with polyester
                  sailcloth. One painting was loose-lined with wax-impregnated
                  cotton duck in 1974, possibly as an experiment around the time
                  of the conference. Linen was used regularly for loose-lining,
                  perhaps prioritizing aesthetics over mechanical properties for
                  this purpose (see [<strong>fig. 4.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-3)).

                <p>
                  Many of the paintings selected for assessment by the expert
                  panel were paintings lined using wax-resin in the 1960s and
                  1970s, as well as some that were lined or strip-lined with
                  Beva more recently. Among the paintings selected for
                  examination were several of the seemingly experimental
                  treatments undertaken immediately prior to the lining
                  conference, which reflected the Greenwich team’s interest in
                  learning new techniques. Fabrics included linen of a various
                  weights, cotton duck, and black polypropylene fabric. As
                  discussed below, two very large paintings were also among
                  those selected: one by Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg and
                  another by Carl Saltzmann, treated in 1973 and 1992,
                  respectively ([<strong>fig. 4.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-4)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  An early example of the typical NMM method of wax-resin lining
                  can be seen in the treatment of Matteo Perez d’Aleccio’s
                  <em>The Siege of Malta: Siege and Bombardment of St Michael,
                    28&nbsp;June 1565,</em>
                  1656 (BHC0255). The painting was relined in 1967, and the
                  treatment was deemed successful at the time. However, in 1989
                  the canvas was found to be sagging near the bottom edge, which
                  necessitated removal from the stretcher and restretching. The
                  painting was of a reasonably large size (137.2 x 193 cm) and
                  was exhibited in the time between the two treatments in a
                  fluctuating environment, so these issues were not felt to be
                  particularly surprising.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Due to failure of the previous lining along the top edge, de
                  Loutherbourg’s
                  <em>Defeat of the Spanish Armada, 8 August 1588</em> (BHC0264)
                  was relined in 1973. The work was included in the exhibition
                  accompanying the 1974 conference as an example of a
                  contemporary lining ([<strong>fig. 4.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-5)).
                  A wax-resin relining followed the standard NMM litho paper
                  prestretching ([[Chittenden, Lewis, and Percival-Prescott
                  2003]]). However, complications occurred in the process.
                  Records indicate that the large size of the painting (214.6 x
                  278.1 cm) necessitated relining on the hot table in two parts.
                  After some technical difficulties in heating the table to the
                  necessary temperature, it was found that the lined half
                  displayed cockling due to differential thermal expansion. The
                  expert panel cited cockling as a common phenomenon when
                  paintings were lined in sections and said that this could
                  often be magnified over a large scale. Despite the documented
                  difficulties, our experts agreed that the lining appeared to
                  be performing well, and in the long term these issues did not
                  appear to have a detrimental effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the study, several examples of experimental lining
                  fabrics were examined. Rowland Johan Robb Langmaid’s
                  <em>HMS</em> Dido, Ajax <em>and</em> Orion
                  <em>in Action Off Crete, 21 May 1941,</em> (BHC0678) was lined
                  in 1973 using Beva and a black polypropylene fabric ([<strong>fig. 4.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-6)).
                  Although well adhered, the lining textile is now displaying
                  signs of embrittlement and degradation, with splitting on the
                  turnover edges. Another unusual choice was the wax-resin
                  double lining on cotton duck with a Melinex film stuck to the
                  reverse, which was used in the 1974 relining of Dominic
                  Serres’s
                  <em>Destruction of the American Fleet at Penobscot Bay, 14
                    August 1779</em>, late eighteenth century (BHC0425). Robert Luny’s
                  <em>The East Indiaman</em> York
                  <em>and Other Vessels,</em> 1788 (BHC3735) was lined in 1974
                  onto “post office bagging,” a fairly coarse linen that had
                  been collected as a sample during the research travels prior
                  to the conference.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As indicated by the conservation records, the post-1974
                  conference years saw a general move away from wax-resin
                  linings on linen and toward Beva&nbsp;371 linings on synthetic
                  fabrics. The relining of Carl Saltzmann’s
                  <em>German Fleet Manoeuvres on High Seas</em> (BHC0648) in
                  1992, using Beva 371 on polyester sailcloth, exemplifies this
                  trend. Prior to relining the painting had suffered from a poor
                  mix of glue paste, which exhibited hard lumps, and the
                  inexplicable inclusion of egg and eggshell. As with the de
                  Loutherbourg, the painting’s vast size necessitated lining in
                  two halves, which again resulted in substantial undulations.
                  Once it was off the hot table it was noted that the lining was
                  not well adhered in places, and a hand lining with local
                  pressing was employed to address the problem. Despite the
                  initial issues the lining was very successful, and today it is
                  performing well, with little evidence of the undulations
                  present before the 1992 treatment and only very slight
                  slackness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, those reviewing these paintings in 2019 felt that the
                  vast majority were in good condition and the linings and
                  strip-linings were performing well. Aside from some
                  experimentation around the time of the lining conference, the
                  team at the NMM tended to employ tried-and-tested methods and
                  materials that they developed gradually over the years. This
                  consistent approach surely contributed to their calm ability
                  to overcome obstacles when they arose, as demonstrated in the
                  de Loutherbourg and Saltzmann treatments.

                  The Courtauld collection was established by key bequests of
                  old master paintings and Impressionist works in the 1930s.
                  When the Department of Conservation and Technology was created
                  in 1931, the collection’s paintings were first treated by the
                  experienced tutors and by the students under their
                  supervision. In 1998, Stephen Gritt was appointed as the first
                  Courtauld Gallery conservator, and the majority of this
                  workload shifted away from the Department.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  The students primarily worked on paintings from other museums,
                  societies, and private collections that dated from the
                  fourteenth century to modern periods, with treatments ranging
                  from surface cleaning to full lining/relining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>

                  From the 1950s, the department was involved in lining research
                  ([[Straub and Rees-Jones 1955]]). At the 1974 Greenwich
                  conference, students Hedley, Stephen Hackney, and Alan
                  Cummings presented their research work ([[Hedley, Hackney, and
                  Cummings 2003]]). Vishwa Mehra was invited to the department
                  on at least two occasions (1978 and 1981) to give workshops
                  demonstrating his cold lining technique.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  From 1982 until his untimely death in 1990, Hedley was a
                  lecturer focusing on, among other things, the mechanical
                  properties of synthetic canvases as lining supports ([[Hedley
                  and Villers 1982]]). The environment was thus favorable for
                  experimentation and development of techniques and materials
                  (e.g., [[Phenix and Hedley 1984]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>

                  Two strands emerge in the Courtauld reports: the paintings
                  from the Courtauld Gallery collection and the paintings from
                  external collections. Out of the 1,023 reports consulted from
                  1968 to 1996, 124 included structural treatment of some
                  description (approximately 12%). Only eighteen reports from
                  before 1980 were found, so the pre-1980 areas on the graphs
                  shown in figures here should be interpreted with caution due
                  to the unknown quantity of missing reports. Pre-1980 practices
                  were gathered through interviews with conservators studying or
                  working at the Courtauld during this period.

                  The vacuum envelope table developed by Hedley, Hackney, and
                  Cummings was used from the 1970s until the early 1980s
                  ([[Hedley, Hackney, and Cummings 2003|, 83]]). In 1984, a
                  commercially built lining table, based on the design created
                  in the department in the 1950s, came in as a long-term loan,
                  this was used until 1994. Subsequently a multipurpose suction
                  table with air-flow capability and a conventional hot-plate
                  top was acquired from Willard Conservation Ltd.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  Occasionally, hand linings were also undertaken.

                  CIA has a long history of using wax-resin. Waxes used were
                  beeswax, bleached beeswax, or microcrystalline wax, combined
                  with natural dammar or synthetic resins such as Ketone N or
                  AW2. These mixtures were used exclusively for lining until the
                  early 1970s, when Beva and polymer dispersion adhesives were
                  introduced. The very last wax-resin lining was performed in
                  1990 (<strong>fig. 4.7</strong>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beva was taken up shortly after the 1974 conference. Cummings
                  and Hedley had a long conversation with Gustav Berger during
                  the conference, and that discussion was key to the adoption of
                  Beva at the Courtauld.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
                  PRIMAL AC-634 was introduced to the conservation world by
                  Mehra in 1972 and began to be used at CIA soon after ([[Mehra
                  1972]]). It was used for cold linings until 1984, when
                  research conducted in the department showed its poor aging
                  properties ([[Howells et al. 1984]]). Plextol B500, also
                  introduced by Mehra, was used for cold linings until 1992.

                <p>
                  Fabri-Sil, a Teflon-impregnated glass fiber with a silicon
                  pressure adhesive, was introduced to CIA in the 1980s and
                  studied by Alan Phenix as his student research project
                  ([[Phenix and Hedley 1984]]|, 84.2.39). This product,
                  developed by Fieux, was used seven times at CIA from 1983 to
                  1989 ([[Fieux 1977]]). It was abandoned due the weakness of
                  the bond even after solvent reactivation, and its high
                  cost.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In terms of lining fabrics, CIA experimented with different
                  fabrics, almost entirely synthetics, before settling on
                  polyester sailcloth, a fabric Hedley had thoroughly researched
                  and tested ([<strong>fig. 4.8</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-8))
                  ([[Hedley and Villers 1982, 154]]). Other polyester fabrics
                  included Vylene and Permawear 122. In many treatment reports,
                  lining fabrics were referred to as “polyester” or “polyester
                  fabric,” and it is not possible to know precisely which
                  fabrics were used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Glass fiber was used from 1975 until 1981, most likely for
                  experimentation after the 1974 conference ([[Boissonnas
                  2003]]). There were also a few examples of marouflage onto
                  aluminum honeycomb. Polypropylene was used from 1979 and
                  abandoned by 1981. Lascaux P110, a textile with a similar
                  appearance to linen but made of polyester, was used from 1991
                  until 1995.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As at NMM, the adhesives used for strip-lining are Beva gel
                  and film. The fabrics used for strip-linings are mostly
                  synthetics, apart from one example in 1986 using linen.
                  Synthetics used include Permawear 122, polyester sailcloth,
                  and Lascaux P110.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In terms of loose-lining fabrics, there is more variety than
                  at NMM. While polyester sailcloth was adopted in 1984 and
                  remains in use, other fabrics were also tested. Linen was used
                  from 1985 until 1991 and could be combined with a lining onto
                  synthetic fabric for a more sympathetic appearance from the
                  reverse. Lascaux P110 took over linen from 1992 to 1995.

                  Reviewing the Courtauld paintings with the expert panel, it
                  was striking to see the widespread and enthusiastic adoption
                  of modern lining fabrics and adhesives for the treatment of
                  these works. The documentation of treatments, written in the
                  context of a research and teaching institution, often gives a
                  full insight into the decision-making processes and selection
                  of materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As already mentioned, very few paper records remain for the
                  earliest treatments. For example, the 1969 marouflage of
                  Lucien Pissarro’s <em>Le Brusq,</em> 1923 (P.1932.SC.322) onto
                  aluminum was recorded only by the materials and date inscribed
                  on the rigid support: “April 1969, 90% beeswax, 10% AW2
                  resin.” Similarly, the wax-resin lining of a fire-damaged
                  painting attributed to Giovanni Francesco Barbieri, or
                  Guercino,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  in 1976 is only recorded in a treatment database.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>
                  This lining appears to have been carried out using cotton duck
                  in a manner similar to that of the near-contemporaneous lining
                  of the Serres <em>Penobscot Bay</em> painting at the NMM.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the marouflage appeared to be an extreme intervention,
                  our expert panel remarked that this had been a popular
                  “preventative” measure in the 1960s. Chief among the problems
                  associated with marouflage was weave emphasis resulting from
                  the unyielding nature of the secondary support, an unfortunate
                  outcome in the treatment of the Pissarro. The painting appears
                  structurally sound with no apparent justification for the
                  marouflage. The work seemed to be an example of lining for
                  preventative measures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the 1980s, several Impressionist paintings, accessioned
                  from the Princes Gate bequest, were treated before they went
                  on display in the Courtauld Galleries for the first time
                  ([[Brown 1981]]). All then nearly a century old, these unlined
                  canvasses were suffering from planar distortion and
                  embrittlement. Some paintings had large areas of unpainted
                  ground and delicate impasto, which posed lining challenges.
                  Each painting was treated with a different solution, which
                  highlighted the speed of evolution of thinking in lining
                  practice at the time, as well as the intellectual flexibility
                  of the conservators.

                  Paul Cezanne’s <em>Turning Road (Route Tournante),</em> 1905
                  (P.1978.PG.61) was treated in 1980 using a low-pressure,
                  cold-lining technique learned from Mehra in 1978. The
                  adhesive, Primal A-C64 thickened with Natrosol, was applied
                  through a mesh screen. One particular concern was the danger
                  of staining and potentially darkening the ground with the
                  adhesive. The report describes painstaking spectrophotometer
                  readings, taken before and after treatment. The lining fabric
                  was polyester, Permawear 122, and the report contains
                  correspondence with the manufacturer. The deformations out of
                  plane ([<strong>fig. 4.9a</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-9))
                  were treated prior to lining by misting with water and drying
                  on the cold lining table at minimal pressure (8.5 cm water),
                  repeated three times with local weighting. The treatment was
                  deemed a success and was subsequently chosen to illustrate a
                  book in Gerry Hedley’s memory ([[Hedley 1993]]). Although it
                  was incorrectly described as a Plextol lining, the success of
                  the flattening moisture treatment and the lining in retaining
                  the improved surface is commented on in the picture caption.
                  Our expert panel agreed the lining was extremely successful in
                  terms of correcting overall distortion while keeping a very
                  light, unlined feel ([<strong>fig. 4.9b</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-9)).
                  Only one area of lifting of the lining on the turnover edge
                  was identified, but this was not felt to be an indicator of
                  more widespread failure concerns.

                  Edouard Manet’s
                  <em>Au Bal—Marguerite de Conflans en Toilette de Bal,</em>
                  1870–80 (P.1978.PG.233) was treated the following year, in
                  1981, to address the buckling of the canvas recorded in raking
                  light photographs before treatment. Caroline Villers’s
                  recommendation seemed to follow the successful precedent set
                  by the treatment of the Cezanne painting: to carry out a cold
                  lining at low pressure. A change of plan is described with
                  Villers’s typical understatement: “Although the tacking margin
                  had not seemed to exhibit exceptional sensitivity to
                  moisture…the canvas was found to be extremely responsive.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                  They switched to using Beva with sailcloth at 60°C–65°C and
                  using 12"Hg vacuum envelope pressure. The envelope system
                  was designed to avoid textural changes, and the conservators
                  also removed large slubs and residues from the reverse prior
                  to lining. However, when reviewing the treatment with the aid
                  of archive raking light images, it did seem that there had
                  been some increased weave emphasis. Despite this, the
                  treatment was published by Hedley as an exemplar treatment the
                  following year ([[Hedley and Villers 1982|, 157]]). It was
                  interesting to reflect on this treatment with the expert
                  group. It seemed to particularly highlight the change in
                  attitudes towards lining over the 38 years since this painting
                  was treated. The consensus now would be to accept the
                  deformations out of plane and to try to avoid lining for as
                  long as possible.

                  Edgar Degas’s <em>Lady with a Parasol,</em> 1870–72
                  (P.1978.PG.87) was treated almost immediately after the Manet.
                  The painting was first strip-lined using Permawear 122 and
                  Beva, but during restretching the original canvas fractured
                  along the turnover edge. At this point, close to the
                  exhibition opening, it was decided to mend the tear locally
                  and return to the painting after the show. The painting
                  returned for treatment in 1983 in preparation for considerable
                  travel as part of a loan to Japan and Australia, and the
                  decision was taken to line the painting ([<strong>fig. 4.10</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-10)).
                  Hedley, leading the treatment, selected Fabri-Sil, but adapted
                  the process to incorporate solvent activation, which was
                  concurrently investigated by Phenix in his research project
                  ([[Phenix and Hedley 1984]]). Using solvent activation, the
                  peel strength of Fabri-Sil increased to approximately match a
                  “strong wax-resin” formulation. Despite the treatment being
                  among the early Fabri-Sil linings, our inspection of the
                  painting found that the experimental method performed well:
                  the impasto looks crisp and sharp, and the ground layer
                  appears unchanged by the adhesive, with the lining remaining
                  well adhered throughout.

                <p>
                  Reflecting on past practice at both institutions, the impact
                  that the sharing of knowledge had in the years surrounding the
                  Greenwich lining conference was apparent. Both institutions
                  were enthusiastic about adopting new methods, adhesives, and
                  fabrics, underpinned by comparison with existing methods to
                  ensure that new techniques were at least as good as old. Most
                  treatments appear to have aged well thus far, although some
                  adhesives and fabrics have unknown aging characteristics in
                  the longer term.

                  The variety of adhesives used by the NMM conservators was
                  clustered around a very specific period: a few years before
                  and after the 1974 conference. As organizers, the conservators
                  wanted to explore all avenues of new materials and methods.
                  The experimentation led to the elimination of unsuitable
                  methods and materials, such as sturgeon glue linings and black
                  polypropylene as lining support, and the refinement and
                  adoption of methods and materials that fitted their collection
                  and work ethos. The Courtauld showed how research conducted
                  within the department informed choices of adhesives and
                  fabrics.

                  The rationale behind structural treatments was explored
                  through interviews with conservators and by reading the
                  archival documentation. Reviewing treatments with our expert
                  panel highlighted how much attitudes have changed over time
                  and the lasting influence of minimalism that was ushered in by
                  the Greenwich conference. Nowadays, the inclination is to
                  resist intervention until the point of complete failure. The
                  conclusion drawn from the 2019 examination was to prolong the
                  life of existing linings by shoring up failures at turnover
                  edges, reactivating old glues, or feeding in adhesive for
                  localized delamination. Future research will explore this
                  topic further by revisiting paintings identified as in need of
                  lining—but not treated in the 1970s due to time or budget
                  constraints—to assess their condition now.

                  The paper outlines the contribution of the Neapolitan
                  tradition to the structural conservation of paintings on
                  canvas. It is possible to trace the existence in the
                  eighteenth century of diversified practices, which included
                  the use of temporary stretchers for lining. It also defines
                  the <em>mesticatori-foderatori</em> (fillers-liners),
                  professionals who specialized in the preparation of new
                  canvases for painting and the lining of old ones. A profound
                  knowledge of the materials of painting during the nineteenth
                  century in the Museo Borbonico advised extreme caution in
                  interventions on glue-tempera paintings by Parmigianino and
                  Bertoja, which were not lined but equipped with additional
                  canvases. The use of transfer has been practiced since the
                  eighteenth century in Naples but has been consciously avoided
                  in the nineteenth century in the museum and only put into
                  practice at the beginning of the twentieth century, with
                  questionable results. In the second half of the twentieth
                  century an improvement to traditional lining techniques was
                  found by Antonio De Mata, who developed an effective procedure
                  for the preventive consolidation and lining of paintings on
                  canvas that reduced the risks of humidity. With due caution,
                  this method continues to be effective in many cases.

                <p>
                  The intention of this paper is to outline the important
                  contributions made by the Neapolitan tradition of structural
                  conservation of paintings on canvas, the history of which
                  remains little known. Knowledge of this tradition has
                  increased over the past twenty years thanks to studies that
                  have brought to light many documents presented during two
                  conferences held in the Capodimonte Museum in 1999 and 2007
                  (see [[Catalano and Prisco 2003]] and [[D’Alconzo 2007})}.
                  These studies made it possible to compare elements from the
                  examination of the paintings themselves, elucidating the
                  contents of the documents and allowing an understanding of the
                  methods employed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A number of interesting elements were thus brought to light,
                  such as the distinction—as early as the eighteenth
                  century—between the “artistic” operations of cleaning and
                  retouching and those of lining/consolidation, which were
                  entrusted to the “liner” rather than the “restorer.” The
                  studies highlighted the existence in the eighteenth century of
                  diverse practices in the museums, often limited to cautious
                  interventions, together with an awareness of the specificity
                  of the materials involved. Traditionally, animal glue and
                  flour paste were almost exclusively the materials employed to
                  consolidate the paint layers and line the canvases throughout
                  the period under consideration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These studies also identified the presence of certain
                  “professionals” who specialized in the preparation of new
                  canvases for painting and in the lining of old ones. The
                  history of the Chiarello, a family of
                  <em>mesticatori-foderatori</em> (filler-liners) from the
                  eighteenth to twentieth centuries, is of particular interest.

                <p>
                  The history of the profession of <em>foderatore</em> (liner)
                  in Naples sits at the intersection of craft, art, and
                  profession, and it is here where the definition of the
                  discipline of conservation-restoration unfolds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1960, Raffaello Causa—the renowned art historian who in the
                  1970s and ’80s would direct the <em>soprintendenza</em> for
                  the Historical and Artistic Heritage of Naples, and who at
                  that time headed the restoration laboratory of the Capodimonte
                  Museum, highlighted this aspect by observing how in our city
                  the conservation of paintings on canvas had been guaranteed by
                  means of “an indisputable skill—and we would like to say a
                  reckless ease—with which the lining of the canvases was
                  performed here in Naples, an operation widely practiced by
                  local restorers” ([[Causa 1960|, 10]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fact, it is possible since at least the eighteenth century
                  to trace the evidence and documents relating to the practice
                  of <em>rintelaggio</em> or <em>foderatura:</em> the
                  consolidation of deteriorated textile supports carried out by
                  gluing these onto a new canvas. We also find that such
                  activities were carried out early on by a particular figure,
                  the <em>telaiolo,</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  or manufacturer of canvases for painting, who would also
                  repair damaged canvases if required.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of these craftsmen was Giuseppe Maria Ranzenò, known as il
                  Filosofo (the Philosopher), who as early as 1726 was paid for
                  “<em>due tele imprimate</em>” (two primed canvases) ([[Pavone
                  1994|, 140]]). In 1740, he supplied some cases of canvas to
                  the Reale Arazzeria, established by Charles of Bourbon, which
                  produced many splendid tapestries for the royal residences
                  ([[Siniscalco 1979|, 278]]). The Arazzeria was based in Via
                  San Carlo alle Mortelle, together with the Pietre Dure
                  laboratory, in the same location where the Art Academy would
                  soon be born.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other testimonies regarding the activity of the Arazzeria
                  between 1761 and 1768 clarify the specificity of Ranzenò’s
                  profession. This information is found in a collection of
                  documents published in 1979 as part of a campaign of
                  wide-ranging research aimed at reconstructing the various and
                  multifaceted artistic activities of the eighteenth century,
                  thanks to a group of historians whose scholarship would come
                  together to give rise to the great
                  <em>Civiltà del Settecento a Napoli</em> exhibition in Naples
                  (December 1979–October 1980) ([[N.&nbsp;Spinosa 1979]]; [[<em>Civiltà del ’700 a Napoli</em>
                  1980]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the Reale Arazzeria, several painters, including Girolamo
                  Storace, Giuseppe Bonito, and Orlando Filippini, were engaged
                  to create oil paintings that served as a guide to tapestry
                  weaving ([<strong>figs. 5.1a</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-1)
                  and
                  [<strong>5.1b</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-1)).
                  Giuseppe Maria Ranzenò supplied them with prepared canvases on
                  which to make their models, and for this reason in the
                  documents he is called “<em>mesticatore</em>” ([[Siniscalco
                  1979|, 282]]), from <em>mestica</em>, the mixture with which
                  the canvases were prepared for painting. But we also find him
                  at work in other activities closely related to those of the
                  painters active for the Arazzeria, which he assisted with all
                  aspects relating to the preparation of the supports.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A payment note dated 1763 describes the variety of these
                  supplies. It refers to a “canvas for painting made by Giuseppe
                  Maria Ranzenò called the Philosopher, ordered by the Court
                  Painter D. Giuseppe Bonito to make the frieze of the tapestry
                  by the painter Filippini,” and the canvas is described as,
                  “with its good stretcher with the crossbar, prepared with
                  priming the color of lead white” ([[A. Spinosa 1979, 382]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A real restoration is then described of two old
                  <em>modelli</em> for the frieze. Orlando Filippini was in
                  charge of painting the patterns for the floral friezes that
                  adorned the tapestries, the main “stories” of which were then
                  entrusted to Bonito. Indeed, in 1768, the same Ranzenò would
                  still declare he had supplied Filippini with the canvases on
                  which to paint “the flowers for the friezes” ([[A. Spinosa
                  1979, 383]]). Evidently, sometimes these oil paintings that
                  served as <em>modelli</em> for the friezes were reused, and
                  this explains the restoration of the “old <em>modello</em> for
                  the frieze” mentioned in the note of 1762: “It has been lined
                  with a single piece of fine canvas and it has been filled in
                  many areas having first flattened it on a larger stretcher;
                  then it was attached to its own stretcher that was in the
                  Arazzeria” ([[A. Spinosa 1979, 382]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining procedure is described here with details rarely
                  found in the sources. The document indicates the type of
                  canvas used: “<em>fina</em>” (fine, or thin) and “a single
                  piece” (that is, without seams). It describes the use of a
                  stretcher that we would now call temporary: larger than the
                  original one, prepared specifically for the lining procedure.
                  And it tells us that the lined painting was then placed back
                  on its original stretcher.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also learn that Ranzenò filled the gaps with
                  “<em>stucco</em>” (filler), and we therefore learn that this
                  phase of the restoration was carried out by the liner himself.
                  In fact, the <em>stucco</em> used at the time for these
                  reparations was of a nature closely related to the
                  <em>mestica</em>—a mixture of oil and pigments with which new
                  canvases were prepared for painting (applied over a layer of
                  animal glue plus other ingredients such as flour, starch,
                  sugar). And as mentioned, Ranzenò is described precisely as a
                  <em>mesticatore.</em> The profession of one who prepares
                  canvases for painting was evidently already well defined at
                  the time and closely linked to that of the supplier of
                  canvases and stretchers—and finally to that of a liner and
                  repairer of canvases. The profession that we would call
                  restorer, but it was at the time—and for a long time
                  after—reserved for the operations considered more “noble”: the
                  “restoration” was the pictorial one, of the painting surface,
                  and the specific task of the artist. It was not yet
                  autonomous.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Paradoxically, however—precisely because it belonged to a
                  subordinate profession that lacked pretensions to artistry—the
                  type of restoration that we would call conservative, related
                  to the mending and lining of the canvas, already appears in
                  the mid‑eighteenth century with characteristics and methods
                  that have been perpetuated (with necessary adjustments), up to
                  the present day.

                  The Eighteenth-Century Restorations for the Royal Museum
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In the years 1758 and 1759, Ranzenò was engaged in the
                  restoration of the paintings from the Royal Collection housed
                  in the Palace of Capodimonte, where he directed two
                  <em>stiratori</em> (ironers), Nicola di Mauro and Pasquale
                  Senzapaura, who in this case worked exclusively on the
                  repairing and relining of canvases ([[Filangieri di Candida
                  1902|, 225]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In these years, Father Giovanni Maria della Torre was the
                  custodian of the Farnese Collection in the palace, and in
                  charge of setting up the gallery. In a letter in which he
                  gives an account of the work on the paintings, he describes
                  the intervention of the ironers as follows: “The
                  <em>accomodamento</em> [repair] of them consists in tensioning
                  again, repairing, and changing the canvases, and working on
                  them. All this is carried out by <em>manuali</em> [skilled
                  workers].”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is a further subdivision of the work. “The other part of
                  the <em>accomodamento</em> consists of filling the holes of
                  which there are many, making good the flaking […] with the
                  utmost diligence and skill by means of the
                  <em>stucco a colore</em> [colored filler].”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  This operation is assigned to Andrea Liano, an artist of
                  limited prestige who dedicated himself to the diligent repair
                  of paint losses, recovering the unity of the paintings; as a
                  result, they are deemed “so perfect that they do not require
                  anything further.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  Although it is difficult to identify with certainty
                  restorations of this historical moment and situation, we can
                  very frequently identify paintings that contain traces of
                  restorations dating back to the eighteenth century in which
                  the losses are filled with a material composed of oil and
                  earth pigments, completely similar to the preparation applied
                  on the canvases at the time. We can imagine that this phase,
                  carried out with care, effectively recovered the material—and
                  even chromatic continuity, to a certain extent—of the
                  painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contrast to the assessment of the <em>accomodamento</em>,
                  the artistic restoration, entrusted to the court painter
                  Clemente Ruta, is questioned by della Torre, who reports the
                  critical opinion of the connoisseurs (<em>Intendenti</em>): “I
                  therefore do not see what else is desirable for these same
                  paintings, and consequently I do not see any need for the
                  painter D. Clemente Ruta to bring them to the Royal Palace of
                  Naples, if not to give them a brushstroke or two, or some
                  varnish, which in the opinion of all the
                  <em>Intendenti</em> is to alter the old paintings.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A distinct intermediate activity was therefore taking shape—if
                  not conservation, exactly, perhaps adjusting or repairing—a
                  field of action somewhere between lining and artistic
                  restoration in which both Ranzenò and his collaborator
                  Senzapaura—the latter also called the Philosopher in his
                  turn—were involved. Between 1762 and 1775, the two were
                  engaged in the restoration of the copper paintings by
                  Domenichino, Ribera, and Stanzione in the Cappella del Tesoro
                  of San Gennaro in Naples Cathedral. The restoration of the
                  paintings on copper would have included a cleaning but also
                  probably consolidation of the flaking layers of paint, a
                  consistently recurring conservation problem throughout the
                  history of the numerous interventions on the seven great
                  altarpieces (see [[Cerasuolo 2010|, 113]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A few years later we see the emergence of the
                  <em>telaiolo</em> Pasquale Chiariello, the first exponent of a
                  family of restorers whose names we meet over a very broad span
                  of time, from the late eighteenth to the second half of the
                  twentieth century. In 1796, the latter supplied prepared
                  canvases to the painter Tischbein: “Six
                  <em>tele impresse</em> were delivered by the
                  <em>telajolo</em> Pasquale Chiariello to the Director of the
                  Royal Academy of Painting, D. Guglielmo Tischbein, to paint
                  figures on them” ([[Cerasuolo 2007|, 29]]). From that date
                  until almost to our own times, the activity of the Chiariello
                  family as manufacturers of canvases and as liners unfolds
                  seamlessly. From 1826 to 1828 we find repeated references to
                  the “<em>foderatori Raffaele e Antonio Chiariello</em>”
                  engaged in work for the preparation of the Real Museo
                  Borbonico ([[Catalano 2007]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the 1820s, in the preparation for the opening of the museum
                  in the rooms of Palazzo degli Studi (the current Museo
                  Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli), an intense campaign of
                  restorations was undertaken, for which many important
                  documents have survived, such as notes drawn up in order to
                  estimate the necessary expenses ([[D’Alconzo 2003]]). For the
                  “canvas paintings of the Neapolitan School” a summary table
                  lists the paintings (thirty-two works, including ones by
                  Jusepe de Ribera, Luca Giordano, Salvator Rosa, and Aniello
                  Falcone), and links them over three columns to the list of
                  operations envisaged: “<em>Foderatura e tutt’altro occorre al completo</em>” (Lining and anything else is needed in full), “<em>Spianatura a colla e rassetto in telaro</em>” (Glue leveling and rearrangement on the stretcher), “<em>Telari a zeppe</em>” (Stretchers with wedges)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  (see [[Cerasuolo 2008|, 28]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The operations described in the first two columns are
                  obviously alternatives. In fact, in less serious cases, in
                  place of the lining, only the <em>spianatura</em> operation
                  would be performed. From other documents we can better
                  understand what this “flattening” consisted of: the
                  consolidation of the paint layers carried out by applying
                  animal glue—the “strong glue” traditionally used for this
                  purpose and also used for the lining—on the reverse of the
                  canvas, without removing the painting from the stretcher, and
                  then ironing it in this way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The application on a new stretcher, “<em>a</em>
                  <em>zeppe</em>”—that is, with triangular wedges that allow the
                  canvas to be put back under tension—is almost systematically
                  proposed for lined paintings but could occasionally also be
                  carried out for those subjected to “flattening” only<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  (see [[Cerasuolo 2008|, 28]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, an expense report, for the treatment of Ribera’s
                  <em>Drunken Silenus</em>, describes the operation as follows:
                  “flattening from the front of the painting, glue on the back,
                  stretched onto the new frame and fully adjusted.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is interesting to observe that diversified practices are
                  adopted, but always implemented with materials compatible with
                  those originally used, and at the same time to note that
                  harmful practices were not employed, even though they were
                  widespread in other contemporary contexts, especially in
                  northern Europe. Such practices include the application of
                  <em>beveroni</em> (see [[Conti 2007|, 106]]), oily substances
                  of various natures applied to the reverse of canvases in order
                  to consolidate and revive their colors—which, however, over
                  time caused irreversible darkening of the tones and
                  contraction of the pictorial layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the Real Museo of Naples also, we see that both the lining
                  and the operations relating to the carpentry of the paintings
                  on panel were practiced by professional figures distinct from
                  the “restorers” who were entrusted with the operations deemed
                  more noble, namely, cleaning and pictorial restoration. The
                  work of these operators was often assessed separately,
                  although sometimes the payment was made through the party who
                  took care of the “artistic” part of the intervention
                  ([[Cerasuolo 2008|, 28]]).

                  A Family Tradition: The Chiariello
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In the middle of the nineteenth century, we meet Francesco
                  Chiariello working for the Real Museo. He was an important
                  person who proudly claimed the rights of the profession of
                  <em>telaiolo</em>. Chiariello became very popular among
                  Neapolitan artists of the time, acquiring a singular
                  reputation and importance—so much so that he is remembered by
                  various writers as an authoritative adviser. In the memoirs of
                  the life of the painter Bernardo Celentano, written by his
                  brother Luigi, for example, we find many references to him.
                  Bernardo buys his canvases from Chiariello—indeed in a letter
                  from Rome he considers the possibility of having a large
                  canvas sent from Naples, and we learn the address of his shop,
                  in Via Fosse del Grano, in the neighborhood called Museo. An
                  unusual episode then shows the ease with which Chiariello
                  offers himself to help the novice artist Bernardo in solving a
                  problem of perspective, involving for this purpose a very
                  young Domenico Morelli ([[Cerasuolo 2007|, 32–33]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A lively description by Vittorio Imbriani also allows us to
                  identify the portrait of Francesco Chiariello—called by the
                  diminutive Ciccio—in a gentleman depicted by Giovanni
                  Ponticelli in the historical painting
                  <em>The Convalescent Cavalier Bajardo</em>, presented in 1867
                  in the exhibition
                  <em>Quinta Promotrice Napoletana</em> ([<strong>fig. 5.2</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-2)).
                  Imbriani produced a booklet to accompany the exhibition (which
                  is later cited by the eminent historian and philosopher
                  Benedetto Croce), and it includes a description of the
                  <em>telaiolo</em>: “Ciccio Chiariello, the medal-winning
                  <em>telaiuolo</em> who supplies canvas to all the painters of
                  Naples, richly disguised as an Italian gentleman of the times,
                  is observing the scene” ([[Cerasuolo 2007|, 25–26]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>telaiolo</em> referred to in the description clearly
                  highlights the characteristics that make his figure singular,
                  in some way unique, in the nineteenth-century Neapolitan
                  artistic scene: he provides canvas on which to paint “to all
                  the painters of Naples,” and he is so highly thought of as to
                  be honored with awards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Francesco Chiariello had in fact received a silver medal as a
                  prize in the Solenne Mostra Industriale of 1853, the last of
                  the major biannual exhibitions dedicated to the products of
                  the National Industry of the Bourbon Kingdom. These
                  exhibitions, held by the Reale Istituto d’Incoraggiamento,
                  were aimed at encouraging entrepreneurs’ initiative and
                  supporting the manufacturing activities that had once been
                  promoted and financed by the royal court.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The exhibition of 1853 divided the exhibits into five
                  categories: Chiariello exhibited his “<em>tele buone da dipingere</em>” (good canvases for painting) in the class collectively
                  described as “different objects” and was awarded the Silver
                  Medal “for the improvement of canvases for painting,” as we
                  read in the relative *Disamina—*a report of the examination
                  made by the commission of Reale Istituto. After an interesting
                  excursus on the various types of canvas congenial to the
                  different inclinations of the artists, the “<em>artiere Chiariello</em>” is praised for his ability to prepare canvases of various
                  fabrics and preparations “corresponding to the wishes of our
                  painters.” ([[Reale Istituto d’Incoraggiamento 1855|,
                  231–32]]; see also [[Cerasuolo 2007|, 30–32]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this context, the social elevation of the “craftsman
                  Chiariello” suggests a new awareness of the dignity of the
                  artisan craft and the value of entrepreneurial skills, and
                  speaks to the personal esteem and friendship of the artists to
                  whom he supplied the “good canvases”—a guarantee of the
                  durability of their works.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Francesco was evidently proud of these medals, so much so that
                  in a plea presented to the king to claim his rights as
                  “manufacturer of canvas for painting, and liner of
                  paintings”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  he cited the entire text praising him that lay behind his
                  award from the Reale Istituto d’Incoraggiamento. In his plea
                  he asked to be named “Foderatore del Real Museo Borbonico” and
                  claimed as his right—“acquired with great labor”—the exercise
                  of the profession of liner. He also complained that “often
                  restorers”—clearly those who dealt with “artistic”
                  restoration—“allow themselves, to the detriment of art, to put
                  onto canvas paintings that should by rights have been handed
                  to the petitioner.” In addition to the services already
                  offered to the Real Museo, he cited as a credential the “large
                  silver medal” won in the public exhibition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Francesco Chiariello’s familiarity and friendship with
                  Neapolitan artists—foremost among these Domenico Morelli and
                  Giuseppe Palizzi—will be testified to, at a much later date,
                  by the certificates his son Pasquale obtained in order to
                  promote the elevation in his social status. This enterprising
                  son, in fact, succeeded in obtaining a further prestigious
                  award from King Vittorio Emanuele III in 1901: the concession
                  to “display the Royal Crest on the sign of his studio,” which
                  together with the medals won in public exhibitions will
                  prominently feature on his letterhead (see [<strong>fig. 5.3</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-3)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Permission to display the royal crest was gained thanks to an
                  impressive list of accolades by the best-known artists and
                  scholars of the time. Reference letters were signed between
                  1896 and 1900 by Domenico Morelli, Filippo Palizzi, Giulio De
                  Petra, Vittorio Spinazzola, and Vincenzo Caprile; a group of
                  professors from the Royal Institute of Fine Arts signed a
                  collective document that reads, “for a long time . . . the
                  paintings in need of lining or restorations are entrusted
                  exclusively to him either at the Real Istituto di Belle Arti
                  or by the Museo Nazionale, the Museo di San Martino, and the
                  Pinacoteca Reale of Naples.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  These reference letters also refer to Pasquale’s father, and
                  it is emphasized that the son, in the excellence of the
                  results, “even surpassed Francesco Chiariello himself, who was
                  his father and teacher, and was the first in this genre.” They
                  further highlight that “Chiariello always successfully
                  maintained the name of his father as the first preparer of
                  canvases for painting,” and on the quality of these canvases
                  they add interesting observations: “These canvases of special
                  and varied preparations have the characteristics of excellent
                  fabrics, the right amount of material and aging, so that they
                  are not subject to cracking, and the painting that the artist
                  executes on it does not alter with time, as is often seen with
                  poorly prepared and improperly aged canvases.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The emphasis is therefore placed on a direct relationship
                  between the guarantee of durability ensured by the excellence
                  of the products prepared by Chiariello and his ability to
                  restore this durability to damaged old paintings.

                  Knowledge of Materials and Careful Interventions
                </h2>
                <p>
                  To great expertise in the practice of lining, Neapolitan
                  liners added a profound knowledge of the materials of
                  painting, which during the nineteenth century advised extreme
                  caution in interventions. We have found evidence—both material
                  and documentary—of interesting interventions in the case of
                  two glue-tempera paintings: Parmigianino’s
                  <em>Holy Family,</em> and Bertoja’s
                  <em>Virgin and Child</em> ([<strong>figs. 5.4</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-4)

                  respectively) ([[Cardinali et al. 2002]]). Both interventions
                  are notable in their sensitive attention to the behavior of
                  the materials involved. In these two beautiful canvases, the
                  rare qualities provided by the medium have been preserved
                  thanks to the care taken, which ensured their good
                  conservation, and which is still effective today.

                  A document signed by the restorer Pasquale Chiariello dated
                  September 6, 1899, lists the “lining works” he carried out in
                  the National Museum of Naples. In the same list it is
                  specified that the paintings defined as
                  <em>guazzi</em> (glue-tempera paintings) “were only put behind
                  glass and ‘conditioned’ in order to avoid further damage.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The examination of the paintings revealed that the canvases of
                  the Bertoja and of the Parmigianino were not lined but
                  equipped with an additional canvas: both have been
                  “conditioned” in a similar way: using a densely woven fabric,
                  not glued, but only stretched on the reverse for protective
                  purposes, and fixed to the edges with nails that also tension
                  the original canvas ([<strong>fig. 5.6</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-6)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The edges of the canvases were fixed with strips of wood
                  nailed along the perimeter to the stretcher and then wrapped
                  with a glued paper. The stretchers, from different and

                  Glue-tempera makes colors look soft and light and is easily
                  spoiled by the application of varnish or oily materials. In
                  fact, glue, although relatively strong as a binder, does not
                  form a continuous, even film on the surface, which therefore
                  is quite porous. As a result, the colors once dried appear
                  lighter and less saturated than when wet (see [[Cerasuolo
                  2017|, 220–30]]; [[Cerasuolo 2019]]).

                  A conscious and attentive protective intervention driven by
                  the same care was taken with the two <em>Tüchlein</em> by
                  Bruegel, which were placed under the glass as a preventive
                  measure, rejecting the choice of more invasive interventions
                  so as not to distort the optical qualities of the medium (see
                  [[Cerasuolo 2017|, 220–30]]; [[Cerasuolo 2019]]).

                  The documents testify to a remarkable awareness of the
                  conservation problems posed by these works, which resulted in
                  efforts of a purely conservative nature, thus avoiding the
                  risks entailed by intrusive interventions. In 1846, Camillo
                  Guerra, a professor of painting, wrote to the director of the
                  museum reporting on the poor condition of the two Bruegels. In
                  an 1847 document in reference to one of the two paintings, he
                  wrote that “as it is painted in glue-tempera it is more easily
                  subject to deterioration.” On May 13, 1853, the Commissione
                  dei Restauri (the commission of artists who supervised
                  restorations at the Museum) took the decision “to put behind
                  glass the two tempera paintings by Pieter Bruegel, which are
                  kept in the Dutch school” (see [[Cerasuolo 2019]]).

                  The Transfer: Ancient Testimonies and Dangerous Practices
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Another important aspect of the caution shown by the museum
                  administration concerns the practice of transfer, which was
                  consciously avoided in the nineteenth century in the Museo
                  Borbonico thanks to the awareness of its dangers. We find a
                  clear testimony of this in a document dated 1810: Michele
                  Arditi strongly opposed Paolino Girgenti, who wanted to
                  transfer the <em>Strage degli Innocenti</em> by Andrea
                  Vaccaro, in order to eliminate the imperfection caused by the
                  seam joining the two pieces of canvas ([[D’Alconzo and Prisco
                  2005|, 84]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The practice of transfer was carried out very early in Naples,
                  since at least the eighteenth century. In 1742, Bernardo De
                  Dominici recounted the skill of two Neapolitan artists, Nicolò
                  di Simone and Alessandro Majello, who specialized in the
                  transfer of flaking paintings on panel onto canvas supports
                  ([[De Dominici [1742–43] 2003–14|, 796, 994]], cited in
                  [[Conti 2007|, 140]]).

                  The restoration of a painting by Fedele Fischetti,
                  <em>Noli Me Tangere</em>, from the church of Santa Caterina da
                  Siena ([<strong>fig. 5.7a</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-7)),
                  in 1998,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  enabled us to examine a material example of a partial transfer
                  procedure, probably carried out by the artist himself during
                  the execution of the painting, which can be traced back to
                  1766–1767. There are documents that refer to Fischetti’s
                  activity as a restorer ([[Nappi 1984|, 320]]), but in this
                  case it was possible to verify the procedure carried out long
                  ago directly on a painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Observation in raking light before restoration showed a clear
                  difference in the surface of the whole lower part of the
                  painting, which was smoother and more adherent to the canvas,
                  while in the upper part, lifting of the poorly adhering paint
                  layers was visible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting appeared to have been lined a long time ago, and
                  the adhesion of the lining canvas was no longer effective. But
                  when the restorer proceeded to remove the lining canvas, she
                  realized that in reality only the lower part retained the
                  original canvas, while in the upper part the pictorial layers
                  were glued directly to the canvas applied during the old
                  restoration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Evidently—probably following an accident—the painter had
                  needed to restore his own painting, which was adhering poorly
                  to the canvas. He had then removed the canvas from the
                  affected part and glued to it a new canvas of a very similar
                  weave to the original, while throughout the lower part he had
                  continued the gluing over the earlier canvas, where it had not
                  been necessary to remove it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The fact that the intervention had been carried out by the
                  artist himself is deduced from the nature of the canvas and
                  from the fact that the gaps in the upper part are filled with
                  an oily mixture quite similar to the original, applied from
                  the back—underneath the lining canvas—and the color applied on
                  the front over these fillings is similar to the original in
                  the handling of the brushstrokes and color scheme, but
                  slightly obscured in these areas. [<strong>Fig. 5.7b</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-7)
                  shows the areas affected by these “integrations.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The practice of transfer—often claimed by restorers to be a
                  secret capable of saving deteriorated paintings—causes more
                  problems than it solves, as is now well understood. Although
                  in the nineteenth century it was banned during restoration in
                  the Real Museo Borbonico, it was unfortunately no longer
                  avoided in the early twentieth century. In the years leading
                  up to the 1960s, the transfer of easel paintings was
                  considered a way of giving paintings greater durability (much
                  like the <em>strappo</em> technique used with frescoes), so
                  much so that it was also approved by rigorous ministerial
                  circulars, and indeed it was practiced repeatedly, with
                  questionable results. If the operation could have been carried
                  out without very serious consequences for Neapolitan
                  seventeenth-century paintings, which are characterized by
                  remarkably thick and compact preparatory layers—(although even
                  there it actually impoverished the paint layer and its
                  texture), in other cases the consequences of these
                  interventions were truly deleterious. This was the case with
                  Titian’s <em>Paolo III col Camauro.</em> Titian famously
                  painted directly onto lightly prepared canvas, and
                  <em>Paolo III</em> was seriously damaged by the transfer
                  carried out by Stanislao Troiano in 1932 ([[A. Cerasuolo
                  2013|, 197]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the first half of the twentieth century, Pasquale
                  Chiariello and his sons Umberto and Raffaele also carried out
                  many transfers (not always with positive results), while they
                  successfully continued the activities of the family business
                  and extending them to all “restoration”
                  operations—perpetuating the traditional practice of flour
                  paste lining ([[Cerasuolo 2007|, 41]]).

                  The Twentieth Century: The Experience of Antonio De Mata
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Finally, in the second half of the twentieth century,
                  improvements to traditional lining techniques with
                  <em>colla pasta</em> (glue paste) were developed by Antonio De
                  Mata ([[Cerasuolo 2008|, 40–42]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                  De Mata personally took care of the lining and the cleaning
                  and restoration. In his vision, structural conservation was
                  not a subordinate phase but together with the other phases of
                  conservation/restoration contributed to the aesthetic recovery
                  of the materiality of a work. He developed a temporary
                  stretcher with adjustable tie-rods that allowed a canvas’s
                  tension to be controlled by loosening and tightening as
                  necessary. He also devised a procedure for the preventive
                  consolidation of paintings on canvas. After freeing the
                  surface from dust and foreign matter, animal glue was
                  gradually applied on the back, in several stages, if
                  necessary, keeping the canvas fixed at the edges. This
                  procedure, which was completed by ironing the painting from
                  the back, reduced the risks of humidity and allowed the
                  improvement of the surface of the paint film without damaging
                  its material qualities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The procedure is particularly suitable for solving the
                  conservation problems of Neapolitan paintings on canvas of the
                  seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with their thick, rigid
                  preparation layers. Indeed, the animal glues and
                  flour—materials that have always been used for preparing
                  canvases before applying the oil ground and the oil-bound
                  paint layers (see [[Cerasuolo 2017|, 240–41]]; [[Véliz 1982,
                  50–51]]), are highly compatible with the original ones, and
                  are able to effectively consolidate old master paintings on
                  canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Comparing the condition of many paintings in the Capodimonte
                  Museum that have been lined in the last fifty years—as well as
                  documented and continuously monitored—makes it possible to
                  evaluate the positive outcome of these linings over time. In
                  many cases this method continues to be effective, and some
                  restorers who learned directly from De Mata and continued his
                  practice, can still teach us much about the behavior of
                  materials and intervention techniques. To preserve a
                  testimony, a meeting was organized in January 2014: an
                  interview with the restorers of that generation, recording
                  their memories and observations, in order to capture a
                  tradition that has been too often left unrecorded.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  The recovery of these procedures, insofar as they can be
                  effective and safe, will hopefully be a task and a legacy of
                  the new generations.
