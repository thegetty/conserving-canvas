                  In 2019 Yale University, with the support of the Getty
                  Foundation, held an international conference, where nearly
                  four hundred attendees from more than twenty countries
                  gathered to discuss a vital topic: how best to conserve
                  paintings on canvas. It was the first major symposium on the
                  subject since 1974, when wax-resin and glue-paste lining
                  reigned as the predominant conservation techniques. Over the
                  past fifty years, such methods, which were often destructive
                  to artworks, have become less widely used in favor of more
                  minimalist approaches to intervention. More recent decades
                  have witnessed the reevaluation of traditional practices as
                  well as focused research supporting significant new
                  methodologies, procedures, and synthetic materials for the
                  care and conservation of paintings on fabric supports.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Conserving Canvas compiles the proceedings of the conference,
                  presenting a wide array of papers and posters that provide
                  important global perspectives on the history, current state,
                  and future needs of the field. Featuring an expansive glossary
                  of terms that will be an invaluable resource for conservators
                  and other practitioners, this publication promises to become a
                  standard reference for the international conservation
                  community.

                  We are delighted to present the proceedings of the October
                  2019 international symposium <em>Conserving Canvas</em>. Like
                  the Getty Foundation initiative carrying the same name, the
                  symposium focused on the structural care and conservation of
                  paintings on fabric supports. Organized by the Institute for
                  the Preservation of Cultural Heritage at Yale University, and
                  with support from the Yale University Art Gallery and Yale
                  Center for British Art, this momentous event gathered no less
                  than 370 conservators and conservation scientists from around
                  the globe on Yale’s campus in 2019 to discuss what was once a
                  heated topic in the field. Here we are referring to the method
                  of wax-resin lining that previously dominated in the field and
                  was heavily criticized and largely abandoned after the
                  legendary 1974 conference held at the National Maritime Museum
                  in Greenwich, England. At that conference, conservators
                  ushered in an era of new approaches, alternative procedures,
                  and novel synthetic materials. The 2019 Yale conference was
                  the first major international gathering on the subject since
                  1974, allowing specialists to look back on more than
                  forty-five years of practice and take stock of the current
                  state of the field. Thanks to the symposium organizers,
                  professionals from India to Argentina, from Scotland to South
                  Africa met each other and exchanged ideas, setting new
                  standards for international inclusion in the field. We extend
                  special recognition and thanks to the organizers and advisors
                  who worked hard to make this experience so valuable for so
                  many: Ian McClure, Elizabeth Williams, Cynthia Schwarz, Mikkel
                  Scharf, Christina Young, Alan Phenix, and Jim Coddington.

                  The care and conservation of paintings on canvas is an ongoing
                  concern for museums around the world. Ever since the 1974
                  Greenwich conference, many conservators have shied away from
                  structural repairs perceived as being too invasive. In many
                  cases this led to unintended consequences, with new
                  generations of conservators possessing little to no practical
                  experience with structural treatments. To address this
                  knowledge gap, the Getty Foundation in 2018 launched the
                  Conserving Canvas grant initiative, which to date has
                  supported twenty-six projects involving conservators and other
                  specialists from more than three dozen countries. The
                  Conserving Canvas initiative is ensuring that conservators
                  remain fully informed about how to preserve these important
                  works of art through support for training activities,
                  scientific research, and information sharing.&nbsp;The Yale
                  conference was a crucial launching pad for this work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As you will read in this volume, presenters at the
                  <em>Conserving Canvas</em> symposium addressed historical
                  approaches to the treatment of canvas paintings; highlighted
                  current methods, materials, and research; and pointed to the
                  growing challenges associated with the structural conservation
                  of modern and contemporary works. While the record indicates
                  that the atmosphere at the Greenwich conference was quite
                  contentious, the Yale conference could not have been more
                  collegial. Productive dialogue and discussion proved how much
                  the field has developed in the last four decades, and the
                  energy and enthusiasm generated among participants was
                  positively electric. Over four days the presenters shared
                  diverse views and approaches, which prompted frank and
                  in-depth conversations. The forty papers and twenty-three
                  posters presented in these proceedings reflect that quality
                  and diversity.

                  The symposium held at Yale in October 2019 grew out of the
                  Getty Foundation’s Conserving Canvas initiative, which,
                  through a combination of practical workshops, publications and
                  research support, and expert meetings, aims to evaluate and
                  foster the structural treatment of paintings on canvas (<a href="#fig-0-1"><strong>fig. 0.1</strong></a>). The symposium was planned with the 1974 Greenwich
                  Conference on Comparative Lining Techniques,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  the last international conference to be held on this subject,
                  very much in mind. In 1974, conservators from institutions and
                  in private practice demonstrated a wide range of techniques,
                  both innovative and traditional, and in doing so raised some
                  fundamental questions that are still central to our thinking
                  and decision-making process in planning structural treatments.
                  In the forty-five years since, however, the options for lining
                  and alternatives to lining have expanded. The new options are
                  drawn from a variety of sources: advances in the materials
                  industry, with the production of synthetic adhesives and
                  textiles and the introduction of nanotechnology; new research
                  into the mechanical behavior of laminate structures; and the
                  resourcefulness of conservators who approach their work with
                  innovation. Concerns at the forefront of the field in 2019
                  also included environmental sustainability and a heightened
                  awareness of the benefits of a global perspective on painting
                  conservation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The timeliness of the Conserving Canvas initiative and the
                  conference is clear. In the planning stages, it was thought
                  the sessions would be held on Yale’s West Campus, where the
                  conservation studios and Institute for Preservation of
                  Cultural Heritage are located. High demand quickly dictated a
                  move to the more spacious auditorium at the Yale Art Gallery,
                  which filled to capacity. The auditorium was filled with over
                  370 attendees from more than twenty-five countries, likely the
                  largest gathering of painting conservators ever convened (<a href="#fig-0-2"><strong>fig. 0.2</strong></a>). This interest in the topic was also mirrored in the
                  international response in papers presented by conservators who
                  represented more than twenty countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The impact of the postprints of the 1974 conference was even
                  greater than the conference itself, as they not only presented
                  to a much wider audience the different approaches introduced
                  there, but also questioned previously held assumptions. While
                  the conference provided the opportunity for conservators to
                  compare lining techniques, with a focus on practical
                  workshops, the necessity of lining as a preservation measure
                  was ultimately called into question. For many, the most
                  perceptive and significant paper was the opening presentation
                  by Westby Percival-Prescott, “The Lining Cycle,” in which he
                  demonstrated how artists’ techniques of a certain period would
                  affect the response of those paintings to particular lining
                  practices at the time, usually evident many years later when
                  those paintings were deemed to require lining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Percival-Prescott’s paper, after reviewing different lining
                  techniques, called for research into methods that might
                  prevent the necessity of lining (see
                  <a href="#paper-42">Stoner</a> in this publication). In effect,
                  a call for historical research and a minimalist approach were
                  made.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With this context in mind, the call for papers for this
                  symposium made in September 2018 announced, “The symposium
                  will address historical approaches to and theories of the
                  structural conservation of canvas paintings; current methods,
                  materials and research, both practical and scientific; and the
                  challenges facing the structural conservation of modern and
                  contemporary works.” This reflected, in the view of the
                  Advisory Committee,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  developments and concerns in the structural treatment of works
                  on canvas today. The response to the call for papers was much
                  larger than expected and the proposals submitted guided the
                  committee to choose the sections laid out in these postprints.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While Percival-Prescott’s paper was unique in providing an
                  historical review in 1974, in the 2019 symposium historical
                  research played a very significant role. The recent research
                  into contemporary documentary sources, discussed in
                  contributions by <a href="#paper-5">Angela Cerasuolo</a>,
                  <a href="#paper-10">Matteo Rossi-Doria</a>, and
                  <a href="#paper-18">Ana Calvo et al.</a>, attest to considered
                  practices dating back to the eighteenth century and before. In
                  many cases written sources can be linked to surviving
                  treatments, often demonstrating the unexpected longevity of
                  linings carried out with natural materials. A strong case is
                  made for the use of natural materials—both for their low
                  toxicity and their performance over time. On the other hand,
                  assumptions about the stabilizing hydrophobic attributes of
                  wax-resin treatments were called into question by new
                  research, as can be seen, for example, in the work by [Emilie
                  Froment](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/paper-46).
                  A divide on seeking flexibility (as in mist lining) or
                  rigidity (as demonstrated in
                  <a href="#paper-22">Lynne Harrison’s paper</a>) in a lining or
                  lining system emerged, which also represented the trends of
                  research on lining procedures, and the mechanical behavior of
                  the composite structure of paintings since the Greenwich
                  Lining Conference. The fact that many of the practical and
                  philosophical divides in structural practices still fall along
                  geographic lines speaks to the sustained, deep roots in
                  historic treatment practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another theme that emerged at the conference was an emphasis
                  on the history and treatment of collections as a whole, as
                  well as forward-looking preventive care of collections. Here,
                  too, the role of past and ongoing research was evident,
                  although perhaps not always carried over into practice.
                  Increased levels of documentation also allow for the
                  examination and analysis of more data, mostly focused on
                  collections and their treatment histories. The greater
                  attention to documentation has enabled reviews of
                  institutional practice—which, when the data is extensive
                  enough, reveals trends, as evidenced in the contributions by
                  <a href="#paper-34">Nicola Costaras</a> and [Lauren Bradley and
                  Josh
                  Summer](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/paper-42).
                  A series of case studies covered the treatment of works large
                  and small and highlighted the significant attention paid to
                  local interventions, which demonstrate conservation’s
                  continuing ability to adopt and adapt existing techniques and
                  equipment from other fields, such as textile conservation,
                  imaging technology, and mechanical engineering. Papers
                  included research using samples of significant natural aging
                  and showed the ongoing embrace of new materials—both from
                  other fields and those specifically developed for
                  conservation. The audience was introduced to
                  <a href="#paper-30">Flock and Demuth’s “Winnie”</a> for the
                  application of glue in tear mends, for example, as well as the
                  adhesive meshes developed by
                  <a href="#paper-28">Mona Konietzny et al.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Threaded through all of these topics at the conference was the
                  ongoing question of definitions, of finding a common
                  vocabulary to describe—with as much precision and accuracy as
                  possible—what conservators see and do. This is especially
                  critical in order to exchange philosophies, methodologies, and
                  techniques with an international community that has grown out
                  of a variety of historic traditions and practice in vastly
                  different climates. To that end, we have included a
                  <a href="#glossary">glossary</a> based on the one published in
                  the 1974 preprints. Terms no longer in use have been deleted
                  and terms that have become current have been added. It is our
                  hope that this revised glossary reflects developments since
                  1974 while also attempting to define terms that can be used
                  universally. Finally, around the margins, but clearly moving
                  to a central position, is the question of sustainability, in
                  all its various forms. Indeed here is a term in need of
                  definition and common understanding.

                  One part of the conference that is not available to the reader
                  of these proceedings is the day devoted to practical
                  demonstrations—“sandbox sessions” that provided the
                  opportunity for experiential learning (<a href="#fig-0-3"><strong>fig. 0.3</strong></a>). Expert contributors led sessions on historic
                  reconstructions, innovative tools and equipment, hands-on
                  mechanical demonstrations, and localized tear mending. It is
                  the continued refinement of established practice, as well as
                  development of new, more effective practices, that these
                  sessions represent, and to which we believe these proceedings
                  will be an ongoing contribution.

                  None of this would have been possible without the support of a
                  large network of our generous, capable colleagues. First,
                  thanks are owed to the rest of the symposium Advisory
                  Committee: Alan Phenix, Mikkel Scharff, Anton Wilmering, and
                  Christina Young. At Getty, thanks also to Joan Weinstein and
                  Allison Reilly. At Yale, thanks go out to Stephanie Wiles;
                  Henry J. Heinz II, director of the Yale University Art
                  Gallery; and Courtney Martin, director of the Yale Center for
                  British Art, for their support, contribution of space and
                  resources to the symposium, and hospitality shown to the
                  participants. The conference would not have been possible
                  without the ongoing efforts of Laurie Batza, Beth Bolen, and
                  Elizabeth Williams at the Yale Institute for the Preservation
                  of Cultural Heritage. Also thanks to the Yale Conferences and
                  Events staff, especially Shannon LeGault, who arranged two
                  meals a day and warm welcomes for our 370 participants. The
                  Avangrid Foundation provided critical funding support for
                  presenters and attendees from Spain, and our special thanks go
                  to Nicole Licata Grant. The program books were designed by
                  Stephanie Bedoya with the assistance of Yale University Art
                  Gallery designer Chris Sleboda, who also designed the tote
                  bags for the participants. Advertising support from Willard
                  Conservation Products, Everett Fine Art, and Getty
                  Publications made the program books possible. At the Yale
                  University Art Gallery, thanks are owed to Molleen Theodore,
                  Liz Harnett, Mark Paturzo, and Roksana Filipowska. Many Yale
                  University conservators, conservation fellows, and interns
                  contributed to the success of the symposium, from hosting
                  guests and providing directions to assisting in sandbox
                  sessions and hanging posters, and to too many other supportive
                  roles to mention. Our deep thanks for this to Irma Passeri,
                  Kelsey Wingel, Mark Aronson, Jessica David, Anne Gunnison,
                  Olav Bjornerud, and Beth Godcher. We hope that this
                  publication will be of great value to the international
                  conservation community for years to come.

                        Many of these effects changed the appearance of the
                        paintings. These changes to the structure, topography,
                        and other attributes of the painting have been described
                        in various ways in the conservation literature. Most
                        importantly, though, a consensus emerged that these
                        changes compromised the aesthetic integrity of the
                        painting, bringing aesthetic discussions of the surfaces
                        of paintings to the fore as well as discussion of
                        technical matters.

                  In the latter part of the twentieth century, conservators
                  questioned the practice of lining paintings on canvas. This
                  inspired fundamental scientific studies of the structure,
                  material, and aging of paintings. The implications of
                  mechanical and chemical aging can now be better predicted.
                  This knowledge has provided conservators with a wide choice of
                  alternative treatments, and it supports the concept of
                  collections care.

                  Structural Conservation
                </h2>
                <p>
                  By addressing the structure of a painting, we are forced to
                  consider not only the image intended by the artist but also
                  the artwork’s physical nature and history. A stretched canvas
                  is a subtle and delicate construction devised for both
                  stability and lightness, but if the structure is damaged or
                  failing, this creates risks for both the appearance and
                  purpose of a painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As any artifact ages and deteriorates, it eventually reaches a
                  point when its appearance and functions are judged no longer
                  acceptable. Some of these changes demand action in order to
                  preserve the artifact’s use and prevent further decay. Some
                  changes are not reversible—for instance, cracks, which
                  indicate fragility and may also cause a disturbing
                  interference with an image. Yet, for a painting, cracks are
                  also viewed as a sign of authenticity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Structural conservation of a canvas painting can be a more
                  profound intervention than cleaning or varnish removal, and
                  each intervention presents fundamental aesthetic challenges
                  for the paint surface and ethical doubts for the concept of
                  reversibility. A structural treatment may be applied to an
                  entire painting, perhaps in a single rapid operation. Like
                  other aspects of conservation, such a treatment requires
                  considerable judgment and skill, and success is often judged
                  by its invisibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fifty years ago, a traditional lining method was considered a
                  normal component of any conservation treatment. The lining
                  used was defined by the choice of adhesive, and these
                  materials had a surprisingly wide range of properties, from
                  water based to water repellent. The goal of lining was to turn
                  a fragile canvas painting into one that was much more
                  resilient, but the means and the outcome were not well
                  defined. The dangers in lining were recognized, however, and
                  it was normally carried out by skilled and experienced
                  professionals. But attempts were also made to automate and
                  deskill the process by using hot tables and vacuum pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the student, there was little published information except
                  for some early discussions on reservations about glue lining,
                  the justification for introducing wax-resin adhesives, and
                  designs for hot tables ([[Ruhemann 1953]]; [[Straub and
                  Rees-Jones 1955]]). From this background, W. Percival-Prescott
                  conceived the Conference on Comparative Lining Techniques,
                  held in Greenwich (London) in 1974. This ambitious project
                  brought together experts from various backgrounds, but it
                  succeeded in uncovering much confusion of purpose and also a
                  genuine desire to improve the situation ([[Percival-Prescott
                  2003b]]). Traditional methods were described by practitioners,
                  and several research projects investigating alternative
                  adhesives and lining methods were presented. A wide variety of
                  conservation aims emerged, from restoring the original
                  appearance of a painting to accepting its existing condition
                  ([[Mehra 2003]]). For the first time, the advantages and
                  disadvantages of all materials and methods were openly
                  debated, including wax lining methods ([[Berger and Zeliger
                  2003]]; [[Cummings and Hedley 2003]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  During a period when lining was widely, uncritically accepted,
                  most practitioners had a limited range of experience and had
                  honed their skills in a narrow lining specialty based on one
                  specific adhesive. The establishment of conservation training
                  courses with academic aspirations has now largely replaced the
                  former apprenticeship training, which passed on the strengths
                  and skills of existing practices but had no mechanism to
                  compare or improve on them. Formal training has provided
                  impetus for conservation science, and the study of
                  conservation methods has influenced the materials and practice
                  of conservators, and even some artists.

                  After Greenwich, it was clear that an understanding of the
                  structure and mechanisms of stretched canvas paintings was
                  needed. This has since been achieved by a number of
                  researchers, beginning with Marion Mecklenburg and his
                  systematic studies that provided measurements of painting
                  materials under tension and in different RH conditions,
                  identifying the high tension in glue films and grounds at low
                  humidity. Measurements of breaking strains of oil paint films
                  led to an explanation of the observed cracking of canvas
                  paintings ([<strong>fig. 1.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-1)).

                  The response of paintings to moisture had been a particular
                  concern since the nineteenth century. Mecklenburg’s plot of
                  tension against RH for all the materials on a stretched and
                  primed canvas was a major advance ([[Mecklenburg 1982]];
                  [[Mecklenburg and Tumosa 1991a]]). Gerry Hedley explained the
                  mechanism of canvas shrinking when exposed to water or RH
                  approaching 100%. He also saw the effect of initial weave
                  crimp transfer from warp to weft ([[Hedley 1993]]; [[Hedley
                  and Odlyha 1993]]). The differing influence of pigments on the
                  drying (curing) of linseed oil explained why the application
                  of moisture and pressure is not enough to flatten most mature
                  lead white paints. Temperature response of paintings was also
                  investigated ([[Michalski 1991]]). Cracking of otherwise
                  flexible acrylic paintings at extremely low temperatures was
                  at first surprising. The concept of glass transition
                  temperature (Tg) clarified why familiar flexible materials
                  became brittle at these low temperatures.

                  Long-term mechanical behavior, such as relaxation and creep,
                  have also been measured, providing useful predictions of
                  future behavior. It took sixteen years to collect the data
                  shown in [<strong>fig. 1.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-2)
                  at the Canadian Conservation Institute, which shows the
                  relaxation (loss of tension) of stretched canvas paintings and
                  linings over that period of time, plotted on a logarithmic
                  time axis. Such data is critical when deciding on the best
                  choice of adhesive and lining material.

                  The use of biaxial stretching, first proposed by Berger
                  ({Berger and Russell 2000}), and electronic speckle pattern
                  interferometry (ESPI) for strain measurement ([<strong>fig. 1.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-3))
                  enabled Young and Hibberd to look in further detail at
                  conservation issues and lining practice, such as the strain
                  associated with stretcher attachments ([[Young and Hibberd
                  1999]]; [[Young and Hibberd 2000]]). The complex structure of
                  stretched canvas is now understood in sufficient detail to
                  consider computer modeling of the mechanical properties of
                  both paintings and linings. It also offers the opportunity to
                  study in more detail the effects of minimal treatments on more
                  contemporary paintings ([[Hagan et al. 2007]]; [[Hagan et al.
                  2011]]). Temporary solutions and physical protection may prove
                  to be our best options, but many have not yet been fully
                  assessed objectively.

                <p>
                  Transferring research results into conservation practice on
                  historic objects involves special problems. Understanding
                  materials in a pristine state is not enough to predict the
                  behavior of deteriorated old paintings ([[Ackroyd 2002]];
                  [[Hackney 2004b]]; [[Phenix 1995]]; [[Reeve 1984]]; [[Scharff
                  2012]]). Since an assessment of physical condition and
                  appropriate treatment requires such knowledge, measuring slow
                  processes, such as “natural” aging, is increasingly necessary
                  in order to make reliable long-term decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Progress in devising and applying new conservation treatments
                  is made difficult because at some stage practical experience
                  can be gained only by working directly on unique and valuable
                  original aged material ([<strong>fig. 1.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-4)).
                  It might be argued that this amounts to carrying out
                  scientific experiments lacking a control. As a consequence, we
                  can choose our treatment method but cannot be sure it was the
                  best of several possible options.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the UK, original nineteenth-century loose linings have
                  provided a limited source of acceptable experimental material,
                  but such material has still not been replicated reliably in
                  all its aspects by artificial aging methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the conservator concerned with historic paintings, it is
                  important to be aware of artists’ changing methods, materials,
                  and intentions. There is much detail, accumulated from the
                  examination of examples of painting practice, to inform the
                  conservator of the likely behavior of a specific painting to
                  be treated. For the period from the latter part of the
                  nineteenth century until the present, artists were less bound
                  by academy controls; their aims became more adventurous, and
                  their materials and methods expanded. As paintings from this
                  period increasingly demand attention and treatment, the
                  conservator is presented with a variety of interesting new
                  problems and conflicts, many of which have already contributed
                  to modified conservation practice for works on canvas,
                  currently leading to a more preventive approach. The demands
                  of much recently created art provide a challenge that requires
                  radical solutions, and they are pointing to new directions in
                  conservation of both contemporary and traditional art
                  ([[Heiber 2003]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some developments of lining processes using new materials,
                  such as sailcloth fabric ([[Hedley and Villers 1982]]) and
                  Beva 371 adhesive ([[Berger 1975]]), have so far survived the
                  test of time. Exploring the properties and stability of
                  possible alternative conservation structural materials is a
                  major undertaking, made more difficult by the risk that
                  material manufacturers may discontinue their supply. Economics
                  also conspire to deter time-consuming structural treatments.
                  As a consequence, for many contemporary paintings, restoration
                  often challenges existing experience and costs much more than
                  preventing damage ([<strong>fig. 1.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-5)).

                <p>
                  Given the many unavoidable problems encountered in
                  conservation treatments, protecting canvases from physical and
                  chemical deterioration is now considered a priority in many
                  museums. For the conservator, it has always been difficult to
                  predict the range of conditions to which a painting has been
                  and could be exposed. The environment that a specific painting
                  is likely to encounter remains uncertain, even within museums.
                  Increasingly, we ask what are the true risks for paintings on
                  canvas and how should we decide when intervention is
                  necessary?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Improvements in the environment of modern museums (controlled
                  and filtered air conditioning, UV filtration); careful
                  handling and operating procedures; and protection during
                  transport and handling have all contributed to more reliable
                  conditions. Defining exact relative humidity/temperature
                  (RH/T) conditions is virtually impossible, but the absence of
                  identifiable damage that can be directly attributed to current
                  museum conditions is a positive indicator. However, more
                  recently, an open-ended commitment to long-term protection by
                  air-conditioning has been challenged as expensive and
                  unsustainable in energy terms.

                  In the past, the risks of travel were unpredictable and
                  thought to be large. Conservators were therefore obliged to
                  reinforce a painting’s structure to the best of their powers.
                  With increasing loan and exhibition programs and major
                  blockbuster exhibitions, this has become an international
                  problem. The transport environment has now been examined in
                  terms of shock, vibration, moisture content, and temperature
                  along with their consequences for paintings in transit.
                  Criteria for behavior and designs for packing cases to
                  minimize exposure to risks have become established. An
                  interesting observation from the Art in Transit research group
                  was that, by using reliable methods and tight procedures,
                  transport risks could be reduced below those of handling
                  within a museum ([[Mecklenburg 1991]]).

                  By introducing consistent procedures for the physical
                  protection of works of art, it is easier to avoid much
                  accidental damage and unnecessary early deterioration.
                  Successful collections care procedures have together made the
                  idea that lining is a requirement much less persuasive and
                  forced us to be more precise about its purpose.

                  For the long-term survival of paintings, the less dramatic yet
                  equally important chemical degradation of canvas, size,
                  ground, and paint needs to be considered. However, the exact
                  condition of aged canvases and their continuing rate of decay
                  cannot be known in sufficient detail and are not readily
                  captured in most risk analysis, which is currently concerned
                  with shorter term, mainly physical activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The slow reactions of oxidation and hydrolysis that take place
                  in degrading cellulose and oil paint are the main reasons that
                  painting materials become fragile. What were originally stable
                  structures no longer perform their design function, and
                  physical damage often follows. Air pollution and light
                  contribute to this deterioration, involving chemical
                  interactions between canvas and its immediate environment.
                  They play a subtle, perhaps unstoppable, role in aging.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the period between 1900 and 1960, air pollution was at its
                  worst in many countries. Most museums were not
                  air-conditioned, and until about 1990 concentrations of
                  particulates and the strong acidic gas sulfur dioxide remained
                  unacceptably high. In the last hundred years or so, exposed
                  canvas has adsorbed sulfur dioxide from air pollution; the
                  sulfur dioxide then reacts with the cellulose in the canvas.
                  The products are not volatile and remain in the canvas,
                  facilitating hydrolysis reactions. All acidity, whether from
                  external and internal pollution or simply from oxidation,
                  cause measurable weakening and embrittlement of the canvas
                  ([<strong>fig. 1.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-6)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Efflorescence can occur on the surface of oil paintings,
                  especially unvarnished ones, and sometimes, on glazed works,
                  it is transferred onto the glass. This deposit has been
                  analyzed as fatty acids ([[Williams 1989]]), and these fatty
                  acids must have been released from the oil paint. The
                  hydrolysis of oils is well known, and migration of its
                  reaction products within dried oil paint films explains
                  efflorescence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There has been a major advance in understanding the
                  degradation of oil paint and how it changes the paint’s
                  optical performance and our perception of a painted image
                  ([[Boon, Van der Weerd, and Keune 2002]]; [[Keune 2005]]). We
                  are all familiar with the increase in transparency of oil
                  paintings and grounds. The impregnation and lining of
                  paintings with thin grounds can cause increases in
                  transparency, especially when wax resin has been used
                  ([[Bomford and Staniforth 1981]]). We now know that old paint
                  films form an ionomeric structure that continues to
                  deteriorate by hydrolysis and oxidation. Saponification
                  reactions of free acids with alkaline or basic metals present
                  in finer pigments, such as calcium, magnesium, lead, and zinc,
                  can dissolve pigments into the paint. Removal of these
                  light-dispersing pigments causes the paint to increase in
                  transparency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I recently made some experiments involving mixing acid-base
                  titration indicators into various fresh white oil paints and
                  then painting them out. In a few minutes, the pH 4, 4.1, and
                  4.7 indicators began to change color, but the pH 3.3 and 3.7
                  indicators remained unchanged for months. For comparison,
                  samples were removed and exposed to ammonia vapor to return
                  them to their initial color (for a short time). Similar
                  control samples in artists acrylic paint did not change color
                  at all. This demonstrates that oil paint becomes acidic within
                  a short period of time ([[Hackney 2020]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The acidic nature of dried oil paint is the reason why artists
                  do not paint directly on canvas but instead protect it with a
                  coat of glue size. The application of an oil ground or paint
                  on top of this water-soluble size layer produces many of the
                  structural and mechanical problems that we have to deal with.
                  A hot glue size will engulf the canvas, but when applied cold
                  it can accumulate on the canvas surface ([[Morgan et al.
                  2012]]). If and when a glue size cracks, its barrier
                  properties are reduced and volatile breakdown products (VOCs)
                  may reach the canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Similarly, if we add a consolidating or lining adhesive that
                  can become acidic on oxidation, the canvas will be exposed to
                  more rapid deterioration. These arguments suggest more
                  research is needed into both conservation adhesives and ways
                  of achieving adequate deacidification of canvas ([[Hackney,
                  Townsend, and Wyplosz 1996]]; [[Ryder 1986]]).

                  The concentration in air is not in itself a measure of
                  reaction rate, but it shows that more molecules are available
                  to react. Below 0.5 AER (air exchange rate), the rate of
                  off-gassing of acetic acid, both from the packaging and (some)
                  from the object, exceeds the combined leakage rate and rate of
                  deposition or reaction, the latter being slow processes. When
                  reactive molecules collide, only a small proportion react, but
                  in these circumstances trapped pollution molecules can collide
                  many times and will eventually react. The introduction of
                  sacrificial adsorbers or reactants might therefore be useful,
                  provided they are placed close to the object.

                  There is still plenty to do, but at last we know that we can
                  build on a growing body of knowledge. We still need to turn
                  this knowledge resource into genuine expertise and practical
                  conservation experience. We also need to embed in our minds
                  the concept of preventing deterioration, which will be
                  appreciated by future practitioners who will be still
                  addressing the same ethical issues. The Conserving Canvas
                  symposium provided a useful forum to take stock of recent
                  progress and to assess its contribution to the development of
                  an agreed way forward.

                  Paintings on canvas are composite structures with mechanical
                  properties that are difficult to characterize due to many
                  complicating issues: the wide range of artist materials and
                  techniques, which vary by region and time; the changing
                  properties of materials with age and environmental exposure;
                  and the addition of conservation treatments. Paintings are
                  also composed of viscoelastic materials, which means that
                  properties such as stiffness and extensibility are time and
                  temperature dependent. This large matrix of variables makes it
                  impossible to characterize the behavior of all paintings in
                  the same way that an engineer might describe a distinct
                  structure under a narrow window of conditions and boundary
                  constraints. Valuable information is instead derived from
                  materials testing of representative samples, development of
                  simplified models, and expert knowledge from past successes
                  and failures. As a result of the complexity, heuristics is
                  often applied in conservation treatments. This paper provides
                  a generalized overview of the mechanical behavior of paintings
                  in tension and describes trends that help to refine the
                  heuristics approach. The discussion is presented in the
                  context of a viscoelastic (time-dependent) material model
                  rather than elastic-plastic in order to highlight key
                  concepts.

                <p>
                  Those studying the mechanical behavior of artist paints and
                  painting structures will likely begin with the general
                  elastic-plastic stress-strain relationships often discussed in
                  introductory engineering texts. A classic diagram will label
                  elastic modulus, yield point, ultimate tensile strength, and
                  failure strain from a simple tensile test. The concepts then
                  become incredibly complex when delving deeper into the
                  response of polymeric materials under varying conditions. This
                  is particularly true for artists paints when considering the
                  influence of temperature, rate of deformation, moisture
                  content, additives to the polymer matrix, and many other
                  factors. To accurately characterize the small-strain behavior
                  of paint films over a wide range of conditions, it often
                  necessary to consider a linear viscoelastic material model
                  ([[Ferry 1980]]). Describing the large-strain response may
                  require adding hyperelasticity ([[Treloar 1975]]) for an
                  extension to a nonlinear viscoelastic material ([[Christensen
                  1982]]). An example of this approach was developed for acrylic
                  (latex) artists paints containing titanium dioxide ([[Hagan et
                  al. 2009]]), which provided parameters for finite element
                  analysis in software such as Abaqus. Calibrating such a
                  model—even for one material—is no easy task. It involves many
                  tests and numerical iteration to solve the best fit parameters
                  to experimental data, and simplifying assumptions still
                  remain.

                  When pigment particles are included in the polymer matrix of a
                  paint film the material becomes a particle-filled composite
                  with a viscoelastic matrix. Stiffness enhancement as a
                  function of particle volume concentration is described in many
                  micromechanics models; however, most give little consideration
                  to geometry effects. The Mori-Tanaka theory is particularly
                  useful since it considers the influence of particle shape and
                  orientation in addition to volume fraction ([[Tandon and Weng
                  1986]]). Clements and Mas extended this theory from an elastic
                  to linear viscoelastic matrix for small-strain modeling
                  ([[Clements and Mas 2001]]). The effects of particle shape and
                  concentration were highlighted for artists acrylic paints
                  using kaolin, calcium carbonate (aragonite), and titanium
                  dioxide as an inorganic phase in a recent study ([[Hagan et
                  al. 2011a]]). From this research, it is easy to imagine that
                  the properties of a paint layer may be different along a
                  brushstroke relative to the transverse direction, due to the
                  alignment of pigment particles with an aspect ratio not equal
                  to 1. The composite structure of a painting on canvas adds
                  further complexity given the layering of different materials
                  and boundary conditions at the stretcher. Common treatment
                  approaches, such as linings, add further variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is impractical to think that we can precisely understand
                  the mechanical behavior of paintings with so many influencing
                  factors, which additionally include chemical effects of the
                  aging process, the physical aging of polymers ([[Struik
                  1980]]), load cycling, fracture, and delamination
                  ([[Tantideeravit et al. 2013]]). While researchers work to
                  better understand and model these materials for risk analysis,
                  it is important to use the best information available in a
                  heuristic approach to resolving practical problems of the
                  moment. Waller and Michalski emphasized the value of
                  heuristics in preventative conservation:
                </p>
                <p>
                  A fully rational approach would require that all possibly
                  relevant information be obtained and used in arriving at a
                  decision or evaluation. The cost of—and time required for—a
                  fully rational decision is infinite. Instead, a conservator
                  evaluates, using heuristics (simple rules of thumb or
                  intuition), whether there is an advantage in seeking more
                  information before deciding whether a particular issue, such
                  as a risk to a collection, is significant or not. ([[Waller
                  and Michalski 2004, 6]])

                <p>
                  In “Toward a Definition of the Engineering Method,” Koen
                  defines <em>heuristics</em> as “anything that provides a
                  plausible aid or direction in the solution of a problem but is
                  in the final analysis unjustified, incapable of justification
                  and fallible. It is anything that is used to guide, discover
                  and reveal a possible, but not necessarily, correct way to
                  solve a problem” ([[Koen 1988, 308]]). An important comparison
                  is given to the different approaches of the scientific and
                  engineering methods. Koen also states that “the engineering
                  method is the use of engineering heuristics to cause the best
                  change in a poorly understood situation within the available
                  resources” ([[Koen 1988, 308]]). There is clearly a similarity
                  between the work of a heritage conservation professional and
                  an engineer, with respect to problem-solving under challenging
                  circumstances with many unknowns.

                  A pertinent example of the engineering method is found in the
                  renowned body of research by Mecklenburg related to the
                  mechanics of artist materials and the effects of the museum
                  environment. In the proceedings of the 1991 Art in Transit
                  meeting, Mecklenburg and Tumosa present findings that
                  highlight the tensile properties of artists paints as a
                  function of strain rate ([[Mecklenburg and Tumosa 1991]]). In
                  contrast, subsequent research gives descriptions of material
                  behavior that use an elastic-plastic (time-independent) model
                  ([[Mecklenburg 2005]]). Strain rate is fixed to a constant
                  value in mechanical tests to generate timely and practical
                  information on the effects of the museum environment without
                  the burden of viscoelastic theory.

                <p>
                  The aim of this paper is to revisit some key concepts in the
                  time-dependent mechanical behavior of paintings, as a
                  supplement to fundamental knowledge of mechanics. The concepts
                  relate to many of the treatment methods used in practice where
                  material behavior is altered by changing different parameters.
                  Detailed theory and test results are presented elsewhere;
                  therefore, focus is given to generalized trends for clarity. A
                  brief review of lining effects on stiffness and stress
                  relaxation of painting is also provided to complement a more
                  in-depth discussion regarding the Canadian Conservation
                  Institute (CCI) Lining Project ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]).

                  <em>Stress-strain curves</em>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  A stress-strain curve is derived from a simple tensile test,
                  and it is often used to characterize the mechanical properties
                  of painting materials. Force and displacement measurements are
                  converted to stress and strain in order to remove the effects
                  of sample geometry. The initial slope of a stress-strain curve
                  in uniaxial tension is a measure of stiffness called the
                  modulus of elasticity, <em>E</em>, or Young’s modulus.
                  Experiments in shear mode define the shear modulus, while
                  hydrostatic pressure gives the bulk modulus. For a
                  viscoelastic material, these elastic moduli are time
                  dependent, and the stress-strain relationship is nonlinear due
                  to polymer relaxation during the test.
                  <a href="#fig-2-1"><strong>Fig. 2.1</strong></a> shows
                  stress-strain curves from a series of tensile tests performed
                  on free films of an artist’s oil paint. The results highlight
                  that the modulus decreases with higher temperature and reduced
                  rate of deformation, while the failure strain increases.
                  Despite this trend, there is no simple relationship between
                  stiffness and failure strain for materials in general. A
                  material may be stiff and brittle or compliant and brittle.

                <p>
                  <a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>Fig. 2.2</strong></a> illustrates
                  the results of a tensile test with the time dimension added.
                  The first graph (<a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>fig. 2.2a</strong></a>) shows the strain history as millistrain versus time, and
                  indicates that the strain rate, <em>R</em>, is constant during
                  the constant speed test due to the low failure strain. At
                  higher strains, the strain rate would measurably decrease
                  during a constant speed test due to the changing length of the
                  sample. The second graph (<a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>fig. 2.2b</strong></a>) gives stress versus time, and the third (<a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>fig. 2.2c</strong></a>) presents a stress-strain curve. The latter shows a secant
                  modulus, <em>E~s~</em> (at strain ε&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.005), and the strain
                  at failure ε~f~. Secant modulus can be a useful measure of
                  stiffness due to nonlinearity caused by relaxation during the
                  tensile test.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  A relaxation test is another useful experiment for studying
                  time-dependent material properties, and it is particularly
                  relevant to canvas-supported paintings.
                  <a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>Fig. 2.3</strong></a> illustrates
                  the different parameters in a stress-relaxation test performed
                  on a Winsor and Newton Foundation White film. The first graph
                  (<a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>fig. 2.3a</strong></a>) shows the strain history as an initial loading ramp,
                  followed by constant strain during measurement of stress
                  relaxation. The second (<a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>fig. 2.3b</strong></a>) shows the loading ramp on a stress-strain curve, and a
                  vertical drop in stress during the constant strain segment.
                  <strong><a href="#fig-2-3">Fig. 2.3c</a></strong> gives the
                  stress relaxation process on a plot of stress versus time,
                  where it appears that stress is approaching equilibration
                  after a sharp initial drop. The final plot (<a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>fig. 2.3d</strong></a>) shows the same data on a log-log scale, and highlights that
                  the sample is still relaxing. The results also show similar
                  findings for a repeat test that was performed on the same
                  sample after a twenty-four-hour recovery period. During cyclic
                  load testing on viscoelastic materials, it is important to
                  consider strain history and its effects on repeated
                  measurements.

                  of tension (kN/m) versus time after a fixed strain was applied
                  to each sample ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]). The initial
                  sharp spike is caused by the rapid initial strain (see
                  <a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>figs. 2.3b and c</strong></a>), which is followed by a quick decay in tension due to
                  stress relaxation. The model painting with a linen lining
                  shows no difference from the model painting (unlined) over the
                  measurement time scale. The sailcloth lining causes a uniform
                  vertical shift in tension due to the stiffness of the fabric,
                  which is constant over the sixty-hour period. An advantage of
                  the sailcloth lining is that its stiffness allows for a stable
                  increase in tension, with less strain imposed on the painting.
                  In fact, the strain could be reduced to roughly half and still
                  maintain a similar tension to the model painting in the
                  experimental time scale. The wax resin lining also shows a
                  strong vertical shift due to the wax stiffness; however, it
                  also exhibits relaxation characteristics.

                  The addition of relative humidity (RH) fluctuations in
                  <a href="#fig-2-4"><strong>fig. 2.4</strong></a> highlights
                  some further trends in the lined painting response. Sailcloth
                  and linen have no effect on the response of the painting,
                  since the linings do not constrain the paint layers in the
                  direction of applied tension—that is, painting and lining are
                  free to shift across one another. In contrast, the wax lining
                  impregnates the canvas and constrains the paint layers from
                  shrinking or swelling due to contact with the supporting
                  layers of the painting. The paint layers still respond to RH
                  fluctuations; however, the wax adds surface constraint that
                  prevents movement and a subsequent change in tension measured
                  at the ends of the sample. A more in-depth discussion of the
                  CCI Lining Project is provided by Daly Hartin and colleagues
                  ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]); therefore, the following
                  discussion provides more general information regarding the
                  viscoelastic behavior of painting materials.

                  <em>Time-temperature superposition</em>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Over a wide range of test conditions, it is impractical to
                  summarize tensile data from a viscoelastic material with
                  stress-strain curves. It is also not feasible to measure the
                  full relaxation behavior from glassy to rubbery—a process
                  occurring over many decades—at one temperature, due to
                  equipment limitations and time constraints. In
                  <a href="#fig-2-1"><strong>fig. 2.1</strong></a>, it is clear that a relationship exists between strain rate
                  and temperature, since increasing the rate by an order of
                  magnitude is equivalent to decreasing temperature by 10°C.
                  This implies that time-temperature superposition (TTS) is a
                  potential tool for efficiently summarizing data ({Williams,
                  Landel, and Ferry 1955}). To illustrate this method,
                  <a href="#fig-2-5"><strong>fig. 2.5a</strong></a> shows a
                  simplified summary of modulus values at three temperatures and
                  four strain rates within a practical test window. This test
                  window is bounded by equipment limitations and practical time
                  available for data collection.
                  <a href="#fig-2-5"><strong>Fig. 2.5b</strong></a> shows the
                  result of fixing data at a chosen reference temperature,
                  <em>T~ref~</em> = 20°C, and horizontally shifting data at the
                  other temperatures to line up as a single master curve. The
                  result shows a shift from glassy to rubbery behavior over a
                  broader scale than the experiments allowed in direct
                  measurement. Tabulated results of the horizontal shift factor
                  versus temperature allow one to create a master curve at any
                  <em>T~ref~</em> of interest within data limits. Defining
                  <em>T~ref~</em> at the glass transition temperature,
                  <em>T~g~</em>, would also allow comparison with theoretical
                  functions, and possible extrapolation to temperatures beyond
                  the test conditions. There are many reasons why the simple TTS
                  method may not work for certain materials; however, it is a
                  powerful tool when it does.
                </p>

                  It is helpful to consider practical situations where the
                  viscoelastic properties are of importance. As a simple
                  example,
                  <a href="#fig-2-6"><strong>fig. 2.6a</strong></a> shows a
                  schematic of a broken and curled flake of paint that is
                  deformed back into the plane of the painting. The radius of
                  curvature (<em>r</em>) and film thickness (<em>h</em>) are
                  labeled simply to highlight that it is possible to estimate
                  the strain rate from a few parameters and define the time
                  scale of the applied deformation. Rolling or unrolling a
                  canvas painting is another similar and geometrically simple
                  example. In <a href="#fig-2-6"><strong>fig. 2.6b</strong></a>, the stiffness reduction caused by decreasing the rate of
                  deformation is shown as the path from point A to point B along
                  the master curve. In contrast, path A→C indicates the effect
                  of keeping the same strain rate but using higher temperature
                  to shift the master curve horizontally. The higher temperature
                  accelerates the polymer relaxation and leads to a lower
                  stiffness at a given strain rate. The horizontal shift may
                  also be caused by a plasticizing effect, such as an increase
                  in moisture content ([[Maksimov, Mochalov, and Urzhumtsev
                  1972]]). Path A→D shows a final example from the combined
                  effect of decreasing the rate of deformation while also
                  increasing temperature. Care should, of course, be taken when
                  increasing temperature and moisture content, since extremes
                  may cause unwanted effects beyond the simple relaxation
                  process described here.

                  The concepts discussed in this section are often studied using
                  a technique called dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)
                  ([[Nielsen and Landel 1994]]). This can rapidly give modulus
                  data as a function of temperature and frequency using a single
                  sample, and also show transition regions. Experiments
                  involving tensile tests are typically used when the
                  large-strain response, or failure properties, are of interest.

                <p>
                  The purpose of using tensile test data in studies of artists
                  paints is due to the interest in characterizing their
                  large-strain response, particularly the failure criteria as a
                  function of time and temperature. The related research work of
                  Thor Smith in the 1960s is of interest since it shows the
                  application of TTS to the ultimate properties of plastics and
                  elastomers. Smith clearly summarizes an important finding in
                  one of his many papers on this topic:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The ultimate tensile properties (the stress at break σ~b~,
                    and the corresponding extension ratio λ~b~) vary markedly
                    with the temperature and with the stress-time or strain-time
                    history prior to rupture. Considerable evidence indicates
                    that data obtained at different temperatures can often be
                    superposed to give master curves which show the variation of
                    σ~b~ and λ~b~ over many decades of time at a fixed
                    temperature. Further, the temperature shift factor is the
                    same—or nearly the same—as that used to superpose
                    viscoelastic data representing small-deformation behavior.
                    In other words, the same molecular parameters which
                    influence chain mobility, thus the time and temperature
                    dependence of linear viscoelastic response, also have a
                    controlling effect on the time and temperature dependence of
                    the ultimate tensile properties. ([[Smith 1965, 275]])

                  Recent studies on artists paints have highlighted the
                  application of this approach for generating master curves of
                  failure strains from tensile data.
                  <a href="#fig-2-7"><strong>Fig. 2.7a</strong></a> shows a
                  generalized illustration of a failure envelope created using a
                  similar approach to that shown for modulus data (see
                  <a href="#fig-2-5"><strong>fig. 2.5</strong></a>). The path to point A results in failure before reaching the
                  target strain at the defined strain rate. Reducing the strain
                  rate avoids failure for the path to point B, which is outside
                  of the failure envelope.
                  <a href="#fig-2-7"><strong>Fig. 2.7b</strong></a> shows the
                  path to point C outside of the failure envelope due to a
                  horizontal shift of the master curve from a temperature
                  increase or possibly a plasticizing effect (e.g., increased
                  moisture content). Combining higher temperature and reduced
                  strain rate locates point D even further from the failure
                  line.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This concept of a failure strain mastercurve is also shown in
                  figure 2.8 using tensile data from two artists paint films at
                  <em>T~ref~</em> = 20°C ({Hagan 2017}). The acrylic paint film
                  (<a href="#fig-2-8"><strong>fig. 2.8a</strong></a>) shows a considerably larger combination of strains and
                  strain rates that avoid failure compared to the oil paint (<a href="#fig-2-8"><strong>fig. 2.8b</strong></a>). This illustrates why cracking of acrylics latex paints is
                  much less common than traditional oils over a wide range of
                  conditions.

                <p>
                  An overview of the viscoelastic properties of artists painting
                  materials was provided to highlight important trends in their
                  mechanical behavior. Example tensile test and stress
                  relaxation data were presented for paint films and lined
                  painting samples respectively. These data showed a time and
                  temperature dependence on measured stiffness and failure
                  strains. For lined painting samples, stress-relaxation data
                  indicated clear differences in the response of different
                  treatment methods. The sailcloth lining showed value in
                  maintaining consistent tension over time, potentially reducing
                  the amount of strain on the painting for a given tension.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The concepts were further developed through a discussion of
                  the time-temperature superposition principle and the creation
                  of master curves of stiffness and failure strains. This
                  technique can effectively summarize properties over a broad
                  time scale and may be referenced at a temperature of interest.
                  The master curves were used to illustrate how stiffness and
                  failure strains are manipulated by changing the rate of
                  deformation, temperature, or moisture content. In practice, it
                  is not possible to know the shape of these curves for the wide
                  variety of materials found in paintings; however, an
                  understanding of the trends in material behavior is important
                  when applying heuristics to treatment methods.

                  This paper discusses the situation in Denmark before the
                  Greenwich conference on lining of canvas paintings and how the
                  subsequent period of fifteen to twenty years was filled with
                  curiosity, eagerness to try out new ways and ideas, testing of
                  methods and materials, contemplating failures, building of new
                  and glorious equipment—and a longing for better understanding
                  of treatments and the structural behavior of the paintings. In
                  the 1990s, the focus gradually changed. Interventions became
                  more limited, techniques and materials used changed, and
                  development of new treatment methods and materials was
                  deemphasized, while better understanding of the structural
                  behavior of canvas painting and its consequences came to the
                  forefront through increased scientific study of the subject.

                <p>
                  The paintings conservation community in Denmark in the
                  mid-twentieth century, as in many other countries, was
                  composed of, on one hand, individual practitioners working
                  privately for smaller collections and museums, and for
                  historic buildings, and on the other, a few conservators
                  working at larger institutions, primarily museums, in
                  permanent positions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Painting conservators considered themselves craftsmen. Most
                  had a background in the house painting craft<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  or were trained artists from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine
                  Arts School of Painting. Training as painting conservators
                  usually followed an apprenticeship in a conservation studio or
                  work in historic buildings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  House painting or artistic training constituted the background
                  for the approach to treatments, choice of materials, and
                  recipes for treatment. This produced a somewhat conservative
                  approach, based on generations of experience, but it was
                  sometimes open to new approaches or novel materials. For
                  example, newly available commercial materials were adopted,
                  and after the Second World War, internships with and visits by
                  a generation of young conservators to conservation studios
                  across Europe provided inspiration. In this way, for example,
                  in the 1950s, the idea of simple material analysis and
                  photographic documentation gradually found its way to Denmark
                  from Belgium’s Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage
                  (KIK-IRPA) ([[Coremans 1953]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Conservators, in general, mainly undertook treatments without
                  making note of methods and materials, although some books and
                  journals about methods and materials did exist. Danish
                  conservators could draw on a tradition of apprenticeship going
                  back to the early nineteenth century ([[Scharff 1998]];
                  [[Scharff 2000]]), including some treatment descriptions
                  written in Danish ([[Greve 1855]]). Recipe books for house
                  painters or artists were also available, as well as books on
                  gilding and varnishing. Danish painting conservators in the
                  mid-twentieth century knew about and practiced the main trends
                  and techniques of structural treatments from the nineteenth
                  century onwards, including glue-based, glue-paste, and
                  wax-resin treatments, though the latter were not practiced
                  very much until the 1960s, when they were in regular use at
                  the Statens Museum for Kunst (Royal Danish Museum of Fine
                  Arts) ([[Andersen et al. 2014]]). Structural treatments were
                  divided between primary treatments (first linings), and
                  secondary retreatments (relinings), and (much less frequently)
                  more radical treatments such as transfers or marouflage.

                  This aim could well stand as the general effect of the
                  Greenwich conference on the established painting conservation
                  field in the 1970s and onwards and describes the impact on
                  young conservators making their way into the field. A number
                  of publications have dealt with the conference and its major
                  influence, and they often discuss historical developments
                  preceding and following the conference, for example, the
                  introduction to the 2003 postprint publication ([[Villers
                  2003a]]), most recently Hackney’s overview book
                  <em>On Canvas</em> ([[Hackney 2020]]), as well as elsewhere
                  ([[Bomford 2017]]; [[Burnstock 2017]]; [[Hackney 2012]]).
                  Given this background, this paper focuses on information
                  preceding the Greenwich conference that is relevant to
                  developments in Denmark, during the 1970s in particular—a
                  decade with a number of defining events in paintings
                  conservation that have had a lasting impact for the future.

                  The experiences and events of the 1960s formed the immediate
                  background. A new generation of postwar conservators with new
                  experience and ideas gained from abroad were in a position to
                  carry out various structural reforms in their institutions—and
                  to review the approach to treatments followed in most painting
                  conservation studios in Denmark.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For a while in the 1960s, wax-resin treatments were seen as a
                  major improvement and were widely used in combination with the
                  innovative equipment: the new vacuum hot table ([[Andersen et
                  al. 2014]]). Another milestone occurred when the river Arno
                  inundated a major part of the medieval city of Florence and
                  its artwork. Subsequently, conservators from abroad, including
                  eighteen painting conservators from the Nordic countries,
                  participated in the immediate rescue and undertook
                  conservation and restoration treatments ([[Plahter 1999]]).
                  The disaster itself—and the observation that treatment
                  approaches between conservators differed vastly—caused many in
                  the assembled conservation community to reconsider materials,
                  methods, and approaches and to realize that for the future of
                  conservation it would be essential to obtain a more consistent
                  entry to the profession.

                  Formal educational programs could be one of the means, but
                  only few existed at that time in Europe and the Americas. In
                  Denmark, a government commission was formed in 1965. In 1969,
                  it produced a report<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  aimed at establishing new legislation on the protection of
                  heritage in Denmark. The report considered a revision of the
                  conservation strategy and improved conservation facilities in
                  Danish museums, as well as plans to establish an educational
                  program that would supply the museums and the private market
                  with qualified conservation staff. Concurrently, UNESCO was
                  preparing the World Heritage Convention,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  which was widely adopted in 1972 (including by Denmark) with a
                  broad impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Danish conservation community held seminars, lectures, and
                  courses on various subjects while awaiting the inauguration of
                  the School of Conservation, including the development of new
                  equipment and approaches and the testing of alternative
                  materials or methods. These were presented and discussed in
                  the Nordisk Konserverings Forbund (NKF), the IIC Nordic Group,
                  and at international forums including IIC and ICOM congresses,
                  and especially at the ICOM Committee for the Care of
                  Paintings—later to become part of the ICOM Committee for
                  Conservation. The proposal by Percival-Prescott at ICOM-CC in
                  Venice in 1975 to halt lining treatments pending a full review
                  ([[Percival-Prescott 1975]]) was discussed as well, but it did
                  not have a lasting effect in Denmark. It did, however,
                  encourage consideration and testing of alternative and perhaps
                  less intrusive treatment methods.

                  In 1973, Steen Bjarnhof, head of the Statens Museum for Kunst
                  (Royal Danish Museum of Fine Arts) conservation studio,
                  answered a questionnaire distributed by Stephen Rees-Jones,
                  head of the technology department of the Courtauld Institute
                  of Art, University of London, in advance of the Greenwich and
                  ICOM-CC 1975 conferences. His answers<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  revealed the conservation studio’s use of traditional
                  materials and methods and noted the deficiencies of wax-resin
                  linings: canvases becoming slack after wax-resin lining,
                  hygroscopicity even in wax-resin linings. Bjarnhof also
                  reported on experiments with EVA dispersion using
                  “laminations”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  and further information about the experiments and
                  developments, such as those described by Hacke in the 1960s
                  ([[Hacke 1963–64]]) and Bøgh and Ketnath’s experiments with
                  EVA as adhesive ([[Bøgh, Ketnath, and Thorvildsen 1975]];
                  [[Ketnath and Bøgh 1975]]). In 1974, Bjarnhof and other Danish
                  paintings conservators attended the Greenwich conference.

                  Real Changes—The School of Conservation Is Established
                </h2>
                <p>
                  At the time of the Greenwich conference, the Royal Danish
                  Academy of Fine Arts School of Conservation had been
                  functioning for about a year. The founding of the educational
                  program in 1973 resulted in a major, planned change to the
                  field of paintings conservation in Denmark—not at first,
                  perhaps, but gradually over the following years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I entered the paintings conservation program as part of the
                  third admission of undergraduate students in conservation, in
                  late August 1977. There had been many challenges in setting up
                  a training program during the first four years, but the class
                  of 1977 found a three-year educational program with quite a
                  structured curriculum. We attended lectures, undertook a lot
                  of practical work and exercises, and practiced extensive
                  documentation, including photographic and X-ray techniques.
                  Microscopy was the main analytical technique available to
                  study a painting, its surfaces, and layered structure. The
                  thorough process of documenting observations, reflections,
                  descriptions, and errors was considered a major leap forward
                  in the professionalization of the field and underscored the
                  importance of compiling empirical knowledge for future use.
                  Coursework was based on established treatment techniques, but
                  we were also introduced new techniques and materials as
                  directed by teachers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The available literature was limited. Descriptions of
                  established techniques were provided by copies of the small
                  Greenwich offprints, including the useful “Handbook of Terms”
                  (see [[Percival-Prescott and Lewis 2003]]). Bent Hacke and
                  others presented new developments, discussing the outcomes of
                  the Greenwich conference and the innovations of Mehra and
                  Berger. Hacke had experimented with suction-table techniques
                  (termed <em>low-pressure techniques</em>) since the 1960s
                  ([[Hacke 1963–64]]; [[Hacke 1976]]; [[Hacke 1978]]), and in
                  1979 the School of Conservation received its first
                  custom-built low-pressure table, which he had designed. Hacke
                  held a seminar in September of that year for the students on
                  suction-table techniques, in which we tried out the equipment
                  and discussed “requirements” or options for treatments. These
                  requirements were similar to those proposed by Mehra (see
                  [Andersen essay
                  21](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/paper-21))
                  and consisted of a set of principles, requirements, options,
                  and methods guided by a philosophy that had formed over the
                  previous years and constituted the basis for the equipment’s
                  design as well as the techniques employed. The seminar caused
                  quite a stir, as the new equipment, the new techniques, and
                  the whole approach offered interesting alternatives to the
                  techniques we had tried during the previous years of
                  coursework—and had, we understood, been intensively discussed
                  at Greenwich.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We had also begun to follow conservators who were beginning to
                  publish post-Greenwich information on canvas painting behavior
                  and its response during treatment. Everything taken together
                  though, to be honest, made us feel somewhat lost at times. We
                  were trying to understand the real impact of the more
                  established techniques as well as understand how the new
                  techniques worked. It was obvious that more information or
                  knowledge was needed, but we tried to follow the publications
                  and the views expressed, though they at times conflicted
                  somewhat with the views of our teachers and tutors. There was
                  a clear trend towards less intervention, or even no
                  intervention, raising the question of whether to treat or not
                  to treat a given painting. And if treatment was preferable,
                  how were we to approach it?

                  The Thesis Proposal
                </h3>
                <p>
                  To illustrate the introduction of the new techniques for the
                  conservation community in Denmark, I have retrieved my
                  bachelor thesis report, which was based on thesis work done
                  over six months in 1979 and 1980 ([[Scharff 1980]]). It may
                  serve as an example of the knowledge and understanding used at
                  the time for making decisions—from a student’s point of view.
                  The thesis subject was a small seventeenth-century painting in
                  rather deteriorated condition that had been lined with glue
                  paste. Structurally, the lining no longer served a function,
                  the paint layers were cupped all over the surface and the
                  varnish had become opaque. Having established and documented
                  the condition and the problems, the student was to propose a
                  treatment: either an established method using well-known
                  materials, where arguments were less necessary, as it was the
                  normal choice; or one of the new, somewhat experimental (not
                  well established) methods, which would need to be supported by
                  arguments in its favor and references to publications and the
                  recommendations they made. To seriously propose not to treat
                  was not yet an option for a student thesis. My suggestion, to
                  try a new approach, was accepted, and I began a quest for the
                  literature and arguments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to a few 1950s publications on the subject of the
                  then-new hot tables and vacuum hot tables (e.g., [[Ruhemann
                  1952]]<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>), select publications from the 1960s provided critical views
                  on the new lining techniques and specific issues of vacuum hot
                  table treatment practice ([[Brachert 1965]]; [[Linard 1965]];
                  [[Straub 1965]]). Alternative solutions to the drawbacks of
                  established or newer lining techniques were published
                  ([[Berger 1965]]; [[Berger 1966]]; ([[Etchinson 1969]];
                  [[Hacke 1963–64]]; [[Wales 1968]]). Some publications took a
                  different approach that was new to me: attempting to define
                  some of the deterioration mechanisms (e.g., [[Keck 1969]]),
                  indirectly pointing toward a different or better practice in
                  treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The more recent part of the literature review, through the
                  1970s, was easier, as most of the literature (not least the
                  Greenwich conference papers), were relatively accessible and
                  had been recently discussed in the student group. Alternative
                  structural treatments appeared in publications from
                  international organizations such as IIC and ICOM-CC and in
                  national organizations like the NKF and the American Institute
                  for Conservation; a few authors presented ongoing work
                  throughout the decade in journals or at conferences. While
                  some publications were based on a more scientific approach,
                  most were still based on assumptions, a few experiments,
                  practical experience, and tacit knowledge, making it somewhat
                  difficult for students to evaluate the decision making, as
                  they lacked experience and had few examples of a more
                  stringent approach.

                  Examination of the thesis painting, the literature review, and
                  my considerations resulted in a treatment proposal that was
                  primarily based on treatment philosophy and techniques related
                  to Mehra and Hacke—their publications as well as the lectures
                  and workshops with Hacke.

                  The alternative “low-pressure table” equipment to be used, the
                  “lamination” adhesives and technique, and the underlying
                  philosophy rested on a new approach that Mehra and Hacke
                  shared to a considerable degree, but not entirely. There were
                  significant differences between the two, and it is interesting
                  to compare Mehra’s statements (treatment options) from 1972
                  (see [Andersen in this
                  publication](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/paper-21))
                  and his subsequent publications in the 1970s with Hacke’s
                  statements published during the same decade ([[Hacke 1976]];
                  [[Hacke 1978]]), and compiled in 1979 ([<strong>fig. 3.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-1);
                  [<strong>table 3.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/table-3-1)).
                  The second column of table 3.1 presents a set of options for
                  proper lining treatment that came out of a seminar Hacke held
                  at the School of Conservation in September 1979. The list was
                  compiled by the students based on the seminar and Hacke’s
                  previous publications ({Hacke 1976}; {Hacke 1978}).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the thesis, both Mehra and Hacke are referred to, but only
                  the Hacke-inspired (unpublished) statement is listed as an
                  appendix to the thesis. In [<strong>table 3.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/table-3-1)
                  the Mehra and the Hacke statements are shown side by side with
                  the original numbering. They appear mostly to agree, although
                  some statements appear in different order and not all appear
                  in both lists. The main difference is probably regarding the
                  use of heat or raised humidity or liquid water in the
                  treatments, along with a difference of opinion as to its
                  consequences. In the main thesis text, I summed up my opinion
                  regarding each of the statements, listing which option I chose
                  to follow in a condition list ([<strong>table 3.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/table-3-2)).
                  My condition list was introduced with acknowledgments of the
                  ideal nature of the list and the fact that it would probably
                  not be possible to fulfill all of the options. Likewise, I
                  expected that as the treatment progressed the selection of
                  treatment methods and materials most likely would involve
                  compromises compared with the ideal situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A closer look at the treatment options for the thesis work
                  reveals that item 1 (reversibility) was qualified as “optimal”
                  rather than “full” as Mehra has it. At the student seminar the
                  unrealistic option of full reversibility was discussed, while
                  attempting optimal reversibility was accepted to include a
                  possible failure situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Item 2 (“material identity”) was deselected as a treatment
                  condition to avoid material identity between the natural glue
                  materials in the painting and an aqueous animal glue commonly
                  used as a treatment constituent in consolidation. The use of
                  aqueous glue would counter the demands of items 4 and 8. It is
                  further noted in the thesis that item 9 (minimal increase of
                  weight) was also deselected as it was assumed to be of minor
                  significance on the small painting that was the designated
                  thesis subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mehra’s conditions 4, flexibility, and 5, to fully avoid heat,
                  was not included. Nor was Mehra’s term
                  <em>compatible</em> (item 8) used in the arguments for or
                  against the selected materials. In all, where the Mehra and
                  Hacke prescriptions differed, the treatment proposal had a
                  greater affinity with the Hacke statements, for example, by
                  keeping heat as low as possible but not fully ruling it out. A
                  prominent principle listed by Hacke (item 7 in [<strong>table 3.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/table-3-1))
                  was that each treatment step be kept discrete, and Mehra
                  promotes the principle as well in his Venice ICOM publication
                  ([[Mehra 1975a]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The treatment proposal could be seen as trying alternate means
                  to counter the more traditional treatment solutions and their
                  inherent problems, not least by including the new treatment
                  options employing a low-pressure/suction table. In this way,
                  the proposal followed up on the many discussions that came out
                  of the Greenwich conference and subsequent experiments,
                  discussions, and publications that the followed over the next
                  five to six years.

                  Thesis Outcome—Results of the Planned Treatment
                </h3>
                <p>
                  As expected, the actual treatment as described in the thesis
                  did not turn out fully as planned. The final treatment ended
                  up as a selection of compromises to some extent, where some of
                  the ideal demands had to be partly diluted, deselected, or
                  dismissed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For instance, the application of facing paper with an acrylic
                  solution that had been proposed did not work as planned. At
                  the suggestion of the tutors, it was replaced with use of a
                  thin layer of wax-resin paste applied at a temperature of no
                  more than 45°C. In the end, however (according to the thesis
                  documentation), a temperature of 65°C had to be used to ensure
                  the adhesion of the facing paper—thus compromising the idea of
                  keeping the temperature as low as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Subsequent removal of the previous glue-paste lining went well
                  ([<strong>figs. 3.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-2)
                  and
                  [<strong>3.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-3))
                  and so did the flattening procedure. A humidification chamber
                  setup on the low-pressure table was used, with a tabletop
                  temperature of 35°C and pressure at 50 millibars (mbar). To
                  avoid liquid water in the structure, consolidation was done
                  with an acrylic solution, and after solvent evaporation the
                  consolidant was “activated” by heating the painting on the
                  low-pressure table at 100 mbar and 42°C. The linen lining
                  canvas was coated with a layer of thickened acrylic
                  dispersion, and after a drying period, the dry acrylic layer
                  on the lining canvas and the consolidated painting were
                  activated at 100 mbar and 42°C. After cooling the proper
                  lamination was obtained, basically following directions by
                  Hacke and Ketnath ([[Hacke 1976]]; [[Ketnath 1976]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A final, unplanned step in the structural treatment was added
                  at the suggestion of the tutor to remedy a certain canvas
                  structure enhancement and moating—most likely stemming from
                  the previous glue-paste lining. The prescription was a final
                  treatment of the painting, face down on a vacuum hot table at
                  500 mbar and 42°C. The resulting painting surface after this
                  treatment did not exhibit any canvas structure at all, and the
                  painting was ready for the restoration part of the thesis
                  project. However, neither the facedown treatment nor the 500
                  mbar pressure was fully in line with the ideas of the planned
                  treatment. Nevertheless, the restoration went well, and in the
                  summer of 1980 I obtained my bachelor’s degree in conservation
                  and went on to the master’s program.

                  Consequences—Evaluation of a Treatment and Its Consequences
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In general, it is interesting to note how much the new
                  treatment concepts and material choices influenced the
                  treatment design of the thesis work for me and my fellow
                  students, and how little actual knowledge about the impact of
                  the treatment and the choice of materials to use was available
                  to us at the time. Most choices were based on the then-current
                  “demands” or “recommendations,” but they were also partly
                  based on the critique of bygone treatments and materials as
                  discussed in publications during the 1970s and especially
                  after the Greenwich conference in 1974. The Greenwich
                  offprints were also mostly based on assumptions, common sense,
                  and empirical and tacit knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was also interesting to see how treatment inadequacies or
                  shortcomings in the conglomerate of new techniques and
                  materials were addressed by reverting to better known
                  techniques and materials during the thesis
                  treatments—eventually once again reverting to empirical and
                  tacit knowledge. However, this was to gradually change over
                  the ensuing ten to twenty years. At the time of the first
                  thesis, to treat or not to treat was perhaps not yet a mature
                  question to pose, but it would turn out to be an issue of
                  increasing debate in the next couple of decades.

                  Further Developments—The 1980s and Onwards
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In the 1980s, after the relatively new suction table was added
                  as new equipment at the School of Conservation and other
                  conservation studios in Denmark, conservators across the
                  country began to further develop the equipment, as it seemed a
                  useful tool for the treatment of many canvas paintings. The
                  first suction table at the school was rather small, so an
                  all-aluminum suction frame was developed based on the design
                  of larger wooden frames at the National Museum of Denmark and
                  the Museum of Fine Arts. It was constructed to fit the surface
                  of the larger vacuum hot table and could utilize its heat
                  capacity if need be. This made it possible to treat larger
                  paintings with suction table techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Construction of minisuction equipment was the result of one
                  student thesis during these years ([[Mitka 1985]]). A
                  different student thesis included the construction of a large
                  suction table ([[Petéus 1984]]), and another large,
                  experimental table was built by Mitka at the School of
                  Conservation. All these tables had built-in heating capacity,
                  and the latter included conditioned air which flowed in from
                  below or via a chamber above the painting during treatment on
                  the suction table. Built-in sensors enabled the user to follow
                  and record temperature and humidity on paper tape.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Similar new—and even larger—low-pressure tables were designed
                  and built ad hoc for special projects in situ in manor houses
                  or for general use in the Danish conservation studios.
                  Comparable activities took place in many countries, with
                  either in-house designed equipment or commercial
                  suction-tables ([[Reeve 1984]]). The interest in the
                  techniques and equipment (see [Coddington in this
                  publication](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/paper-20))
                  and the results of the construction and use of suction tables
                  were reported and discussed at conferences such as ICOM-CC,
                  including the 1984 ICOM-CC conference in Copenhagen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the following six years, summer schools on the subject were
                  organized at the School of Conservation (in collaboration with
                  ICCROM) to introduce and discuss suction-table techniques and
                  principles and making it possible for numerous participants
                  over the years to try out selected techniques ([<strong>fig. 3.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-4)).
                  Discussions were lively (<strong>[figs.
                    3.5](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-5)</strong>
                  and
                  [<strong>3.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-6))
                  and included technical and ethical debates on the specific
                  aspects of the techniques and the use of new materials. Such
                  topics included nap-bond acrylic dispersion-adhesives,
                  EVA-based adhesives (e.g., Beva 371), fiberglass cloth,
                  limited interventions, temperature, humidity, strip-linings,
                  loose-linings, and much more. In tune with the prevailing
                  discussions in paintings conservation in general, the idea of
                  how much treatment was really necessary—and if so, what
                  kind—was discussed as well, and Percival-Prescott’s 1974
                  concept of the lining cycle and whether to treat or not to
                  treat was a regular part of conversations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In parallel with the summer schools, a set of visual teaching
                  aids was being produced in collaboration with the Getty
                  Conservation Institute. The aim was to produce step-by-step
                  images of the recently developed lining techniques, along with
                  a detailed description of each step, as a didactic tool for
                  teachers in canvas paintings conservation. The aids were used
                  at each summer school and in regular courses at School of
                  Conservation before being finalized in 1990 ([[Scharff
                  1995]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The production of the aids turned out to be a real challenge,
                  since the treatment steps needed to be explained and, if
                  possible, supported by recent knowledge. As the understanding
                  of canvas paintings’ reactions to treatments was very limited
                  at the beginning of the 1980s—and only gradually became
                  supported by publications during the second half of the decade
                  and beyond—it was not always possible to present a
                  well-supported argument for some of the treatment steps or
                  material choices. However, the process for developing the aids
                  was designed to let any teacher using a given treatment add
                  new and relevant information as it became available, as well
                  as to discuss the logic of the approaches with the students or
                  to dismiss some treatment steps as obsolete. In this way, the
                  treatment rationale and background for the treatments could be
                  updated.

                  While some parts of these teaching aids appear outdated today,
                  thirty years later, other parts remain useful, and the whole
                  set serves as both a legacy and documentation of a major
                  evolution in the philosophy and practical approach to canvas
                  paintings conservation in the two decades following the
                  Greenwich conference.

                  Teaching in paintings conservation programs has changed in
                  many respects since the 1980s and 1990s. Less emphasis is now
                  placed on learning a complete set of treatment techniques in
                  favor of a greater concentration on principles and a better
                  understanding of the materials and structures that a painting
                  is composed of, with the aim of better understanding
                  deterioration mechanisms and the properties and impact of
                  treatments and associated materials. Experimental work plays
                  an increasing role, as it further enhances the understanding
                  of the concepts. Hopefully, it will have an impact on whether
                  the future profession concentrates mainly on hands-on
                  treatments or develops a more general approach to entire
                  collections.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The development of a better scientific understanding of the
                  behavior of canvas painting structures themselves, as well as
                  treatment techniques and materials, took place in parallel
                  with the practical experiments and experiences among a limited
                  number of researchers and conservators. Results were published
                  and discussed at conferences, not least at the ICOM-CC working
                  group on structural treatment of canvas paintings that was
                  active at the second half of the 1980s and into the 1990s, as
                  presented in more recent accounts ([[Hackney 2020]]). In
                  particular, publications from Hedley, Mecklenburg, and
                  Michalski provided new insights; Hedley regularly published on
                  the behavior of canvas paintings with a special interest in
                  studying the interaction with humidity ([[Hedley 1993]]).
                  Mecklenburg and Michalski provided new and valuable insights
                  in painting structure behavior, for example at the Art in
                  Transit conference and subsequent publication ([[Mecklenburg
                  1991]]; [[Michalski 1991]]). Such advances originated from or
                  gradually fed into the educational programs in Denmark and
                  abroad, in collaboration with the steadily growing group of
                  practitioners with strong interests in canvas behavior.
                  Without continued research supporting and advancing the field,
                  it would have been impossible to gain a proper understanding
                  of the structure of a painting, its mechanics, and the impact
                  of environment and treatments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The interest in and experiments with new equipment, methods,
                  and materials in the 1980s that resulted from recognizing the
                  need for changes in canvas conservation gradually faded away
                  as a different approach to canvas painting treatments evolved
                  and became accepted. The new approach placed more focus on
                  preventive means, perhaps following principles of more limited
                  interventions, and coincided with the growing popularity of
                  EVA-based adhesives and adhesive sheets and several proposed
                  nap-bond application techniques (although still using a
                  relatively high temperature of 65°C).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, gradually, as treatment methods evolved, a better
                  understanding of the impact of structural treatments emerged,
                  and interest in preventive conservation grew, an increasing
                  number of practitioners became more reluctant to carry out the
                  number of treatments that had been customary in the past.
                  Little by little practitioners began leaning toward the more
                  limited interventions that many have identified collectively
                  using the term <em>minimalism</em> (see, e.g., [[Ackroyd and
                  Villers 2003]]). The increasing impact of preventive
                  conservation and risk management/assessment ([[Antomarchi et
                  al. 2005]]) in decision-making may also influence the approach
                  to the preservation of canvas paintings in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While further development of treatment methods and materials
                  seems largely to have been on hold over the past twenty years,
                  research into canvas paintings’ material structure and
                  mechanics has increased: How is the structure affected by the
                  environment during exhibition or storage? What is the impact
                  of conservation treatments—past and present? A growing number
                  of conservators and scientists are working together in
                  national and international research groups, taking advantage
                  of the steadily growing availability of analytical equipment
                  and methods, including the use of computer modeling to predict
                  behavior. A steady increase in publications in the field also
                  provides everyone in conservation studios and conservation
                  students in educational institutions with an ever-expanding
                  trove of relevant information. Hopefully, in the future, all
                  of this will lead to a to better understanding of material
                  behavior and deterioration phenomena, and we will be able,
                  ultimately, to predict the future response of canvas paintings
                  under given conditions and develop better means to preserve
                  them—either by active treatment procedures or by preventive
                  measures—and thus maintain our cultural heritage for future
                  generations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, we may have passed the point where there were only two
                  options: to treat or not to treat at all. Perhaps the question
                  now should be whether to line or not to line. Luckily, the
                  advances in the field in practice, as well as research since
                  the Greenwich conference, have given us a sounder basis for
                  selecting better options to preserve canvas paintings.
                  Nonetheless, there is still much to learn, and we hope that is
                  will be conducted in the spirit of the Greenwich conference,
                  which laid the ground for nearly fifty years of progress in
                  canvas paintings conservation.

                  Since the 1970s, the Courtauld Institute of Art (CIA) and
                  Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG) (formerly the National Maritime
                  Museum [NMM]) have been at the forefront of developments in
                  lining methods, including research and practice using new
                  adhesives including PVA, Beva 371, and synthetic wax-resin.
                  The RMG worked closely with Stephen Rees Jones and Gerry
                  Hedley from the Technology Department of the Courtauld to
                  adopt their innovative methods, including lining using a
                  vacuum hot table and vacuum envelopes, working together to
                  develop the way paintings would be lined in the future. The
                  present study reexamines archival materials related to the
                  Greenwich Lining Conference and subsequent practical
                  treatments undertaken in the CIA and RMG in the 1970s and
                  1980s. The authors explore the impact of the conference on
                  contemporary practice, and a small group of case-study
                  paintings is presented to evaluate the success and longevity
                  of these treatments after forty to fifty years on display in

                  From the 1970s onwards, the National Maritime Museum (NMM),
                  now Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG), and Courtauld Institute of
                  Art (CIA) were at the forefront of UK developments in lining
                  methods and the use of modern adhesives. NMM conservator
                  Westby Percival-Prescott worked closely with Professor Stephen
                  Rees-Jones and Gerry Hedley at the Courtauld to adopt their
                  innovative methods, including the use of a vacuum hot table
                  and vacuum envelope for lining ([[Percival-Prescott 2003a]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As part of the Getty Foundation’s Conserving Canvas
                  initiative, CIA and RMG collaborated once again to explore
                  lining methods and our common history of lining. The first
                  part of this collaborative project invited an expert panel of
                  liners from the UK and Europe to review the condition of
                  seventeen paintings from the two collections that had received
                  structural treatment in the late twentieth century (see the
                  Appendix at the end of this paper).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  We were interested to assess the longevity of the modern
                  lining methods used in order to inform collections care for
                  the future. Alongside this work, and to establish the
                  structural conservation history of both institutions from the
                  1970s onwards, a survey of all treatment reports was
                  undertaken, and each institution’s conservators were
                  interviewed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of the seventeen paintings (see Appendix) examined by our
                  experts, the majority remained in excellent structural
                  condition, as might be expected, as the treatments were
                  between twenty and fifty years old. Reviewing the treatment
                  documentation alongside the paintings highlighted the change
                  in attitudes towards structural conservation in the ensuing
                  decades.

                  The NMM collection contains approximately four thousand
                  paintings. In 1960, Percival-Prescott joined the NMM and
                  founded the conservation department in the Royal Observatory
                  building ([[Bomford 2005]]). He was joined by Ronald
                  Chittenden, who focused solely on structural conservation, and
                  paintings conservator Gillian Lewis. Thanks to
                  Percival-Prescott’s intense interest in painting materials and
                  his passionate views on ethical methods of conservation, his
                  department built and developed an international reputation
                  ([[Bomford 2005]]). When asked by Dr. Greenhill, then director
                  of the NMM, for a research area that could culminate in a
                  large conference, Percival-Prescott put forward the idea of
                  the structural conservation of canvas paintings, with a
                  particular focus on lining. This was the origin of the
                  Comparative Lining Techniques conference, held in Greenwich,
                  April 23–25, 1974 ([[Percival-Prescott 2003a]]). The
                  conference had an extraordinary impact on the conservation
                  profession, and Percival-Prescott’s keynote speech, “The
                  Lining Cycle,” articulated the trend for minimalism in
                  structural treatment that still prevails today
                  ([[Percival-Prescott 2003b]]).

                  From 1970 to 1974, Percival-Prescott, Lewis, and Chittenden
                  travelled throughout Europe, the East Coast of America, and
                  Russia, to learn more about lining, meeting experts and
                  filming them at work. Upon return to the UK studios, they
                  experimented with the new techniques, adhesives, and fabrics
                  discovered abroad, and extensive (unpublished) peel tests were
                  undertaken in the Engineering Research department of the Royal
                  Naval College, a few of which still remain in the
                  Percival-Prescott archive at the Hamilton Kerr Institute.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>

                </h3>
                <p>
                  To understand the trends and patterns in the use of adhesives
                  and fabrics at NMM, treatment reports from 1963 to 2000 were
                  reviewed and the information collated. Out of the 2,023
                  reports consulted, 447 included structural treatment of some
                  sort (approximately 22% of all paintings treated).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The impact of the 1974 conference was evident in the treatment
                  data, but other factors influenced the types of structural
                  work undertaken. Chittenden’s retirement as a dedicated liner
                  in the early 1980s meant that his workload was absorbed into
                  the work of other paintings conservators in the studio:
                  Caroline Hampton and Sally Wakelin, who both joined in 1974,
                  and Elizabeth Hamilton-Eddy, who joined in 1978. The move to
                  the Feather’s Place conservation studios in 2000 resulted in
                  the loss of the hot-vacuum table due to lack of space, and
                  major structural treatments such as lining were sent out to
                  private studios.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When reviewing the treatment reports from 1965 to 2000, the
                  impact of these various factors was evident: the number of
                  linings diminishes, whereas strip-linings appear in 1974 and
                  quickly become a regular occurrence ([<strong>fig. 4.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-1)).
                  Similarly, a change in thinking was noticeable, for example,
                  in the introduction of other minimal or preventative
                  treatments, such as loose-lining and local reinforcement
                  (corners and edges, and tear-mending).

                </h3>
                <p>
                  In terms of adhesives used for lining and strip-lining, the
                  NMM shows a preference for a small number of adhesives and
                  techniques, which were refined into streamlined processes
                  ([<strong>fig. 4.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-2)).
                  Initially, wax-resin lining is the only method used. Linen was
                  used almost exclusively,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  and reports mention combinations of AW2 or dammar resin with
                  wax and elemi gum, or later, MS2 resin combined with wax,
                  colophony, and elemi.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  These linings were almost all done on the hot table, using the
                  prestretching technique and the vacuum envelope developed
                  in-house ([[Chittenden, Lewis, and Percival-Prescott 2003]]).
                  Chittenden’s reports were usually very brief, such as, “lined
                  in the usual way” or “lined with satisfactory results.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  From 1971 to 1973, five sturgeon glue linings were performed.
                  These are rather rare in the UK and drew upon the team’s
                  training from “masterly restorer Brianzev” in Russia
                  ([[Percival-Prescott 2003a|, viii]]). Reports for the 1971
                  treatment of George Knight’s
                  <em>Cleopatra’s Needle Being Brought to England,</em> 1877
                  (BHC0641), revealed that “sturgeon bladder adhesive” was
                  selected because the work was “painted upon a white ground and
                  of materials which would have yellowed and darkened had wax
                  been used.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  These linings were performed only prior to the conference and
                  were quickly abandoned; studio notes and treatment reports
                  convey the impression that the technique was difficult to
                  master.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beva 371 was used for both strip-lining and lining, combined
                  with a variety of fabrics ([figs.
                  4.2](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-2)
                  and
                  [4.3](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-3)).
                  Initially, the preference was for TenCate, a polyvinyl alcohol
                  fabric from the Netherlands, but this was gradually superseded
                  by polyester sailcloth, beginning in 1982, most likely
                  introduced to the NMM by the Courtauld. Linen was used on one
                  occasion with Beva for lining but more frequently for
                  strip-lining. Other materials were used more sporadically in
                  conjunction with Beva, including woven polypropylene and glass
                  fiber. These fabrics seem to have been used experimentally
                  around the time of the lining conference and were not
                  incorporated into usual practice. Glass fiber, introduced by
                  Pierre Boissonnas ([[Boissonnas 1961]]), was used over a
                  prolonged period (1973–81), in combination with wax-resin,
                  Beva, or Beva with added wax, to help produce transparent
                  linings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As surface deformations could not be addressed during a
                  wax-resin or Beva lining, they had to be treated beforehand.
                  The NMM developed the prestretching technique, first published
                  at the 1974 conference, to introduce tension and address
                  cupping and deformation out of plane ([[Chittenden, Lewis, and
                  Percival-Prescott 2003]]). This technique was used routinely
                  in the 1970s and 1980s.

                <p>
                  Loose-lining starts in the early 1970s, and sixteen paintings
                  were loose-lined in 1975 using either TenCate or Fabrene,
                  possibly in preparation for an exhibition. TenCate was used
                  until 1986, after which it was replaced with polyester
                  sailcloth. One painting was loose-lined with wax-impregnated
                  cotton duck in 1974, possibly as an experiment around the time
                  of the conference. Linen was used regularly for loose-lining,
                  perhaps prioritizing aesthetics over mechanical properties for
                  this purpose (see [<strong>fig. 4.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-3)).

                <p>
                  Many of the paintings selected for assessment by the expert
                  panel were paintings lined using wax-resin in the 1960s and
                  1970s, as well as some that were lined or strip-lined with
                  Beva more recently. Among the paintings selected for
                  examination were several of the seemingly experimental
                  treatments undertaken immediately prior to the lining
                  conference, which reflected the Greenwich team’s interest in
                  learning new techniques. Fabrics included linen of a various
                  weights, cotton duck, and black polypropylene fabric. As
                  discussed below, two very large paintings were also among
                  those selected: one by Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg and
                  another by Carl Saltzmann, treated in 1973 and 1992,
                  respectively ([<strong>fig. 4.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-4)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  An early example of the typical NMM method of wax-resin lining
                  can be seen in the treatment of Matteo Perez d’Aleccio’s
                  <em>The Siege of Malta: Siege and Bombardment of St Michael,
                    28&nbsp;June 1565,</em>
                  1656 (BHC0255). The painting was relined in 1967, and the
                  treatment was deemed successful at the time. However, in 1989
                  the canvas was found to be sagging near the bottom edge, which
                  necessitated removal from the stretcher and restretching. The
                  painting was of a reasonably large size (137.2 x 193 cm) and
                  was exhibited in the time between the two treatments in a
                  fluctuating environment, so these issues were not felt to be
                  particularly surprising.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Due to failure of the previous lining along the top edge, de
                  Loutherbourg’s
                  <em>Defeat of the Spanish Armada, 8 August 1588</em> (BHC0264)
                  was relined in 1973. The work was included in the exhibition
                  accompanying the 1974 conference as an example of a
                  contemporary lining ([<strong>fig. 4.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-5)).
                  A wax-resin relining followed the standard NMM litho paper
                  prestretching ([[Chittenden, Lewis, and Percival-Prescott
                  2003]]). However, complications occurred in the process.
                  Records indicate that the large size of the painting (214.6 x
                  278.1 cm) necessitated relining on the hot table in two parts.
                  After some technical difficulties in heating the table to the
                  necessary temperature, it was found that the lined half
                  displayed cockling due to differential thermal expansion. The
                  expert panel cited cockling as a common phenomenon when
                  paintings were lined in sections and said that this could
                  often be magnified over a large scale. Despite the documented
                  difficulties, our experts agreed that the lining appeared to
                  be performing well, and in the long term these issues did not
                  appear to have a detrimental effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the study, several examples of experimental lining
                  fabrics were examined. Rowland Johan Robb Langmaid’s
                  <em>HMS</em> Dido, Ajax <em>and</em> Orion
                  <em>in Action Off Crete, 21 May 1941,</em> (BHC0678) was lined
                  in 1973 using Beva and a black polypropylene fabric ([<strong>fig. 4.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-6)).
                  Although well adhered, the lining textile is now displaying
                  signs of embrittlement and degradation, with splitting on the
                  turnover edges. Another unusual choice was the wax-resin
                  double lining on cotton duck with a Melinex film stuck to the
                  reverse, which was used in the 1974 relining of Dominic
                  Serres’s
                  <em>Destruction of the American Fleet at Penobscot Bay, 14
                    August 1779</em>, late eighteenth century (BHC0425). Robert Luny’s
                  <em>The East Indiaman</em> York
                  <em>and Other Vessels,</em> 1788 (BHC3735) was lined in 1974
                  onto “post office bagging,” a fairly coarse linen that had
                  been collected as a sample during the research travels prior
                  to the conference.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As indicated by the conservation records, the post-1974
                  conference years saw a general move away from wax-resin
                  linings on linen and toward Beva&nbsp;371 linings on synthetic
                  fabrics. The relining of Carl Saltzmann’s
                  <em>German Fleet Manoeuvres on High Seas</em> (BHC0648) in
                  1992, using Beva 371 on polyester sailcloth, exemplifies this
                  trend. Prior to relining the painting had suffered from a poor
                  mix of glue paste, which exhibited hard lumps, and the
                  inexplicable inclusion of egg and eggshell. As with the de
                  Loutherbourg, the painting’s vast size necessitated lining in
                  two halves, which again resulted in substantial undulations.
                  Once it was off the hot table it was noted that the lining was
                  not well adhered in places, and a hand lining with local
                  pressing was employed to address the problem. Despite the
                  initial issues the lining was very successful, and today it is
                  performing well, with little evidence of the undulations
                  present before the 1992 treatment and only very slight
                  slackness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, those reviewing these paintings in 2019 felt that the
                  vast majority were in good condition and the linings and
                  strip-linings were performing well. Aside from some
                  experimentation around the time of the lining conference, the
                  team at the NMM tended to employ tried-and-tested methods and
                  materials that they developed gradually over the years. This
                  consistent approach surely contributed to their calm ability
                  to overcome obstacles when they arose, as demonstrated in the
                  de Loutherbourg and Saltzmann treatments.

                  The Courtauld collection was established by key bequests of
                  old master paintings and Impressionist works in the 1930s.
                  When the Department of Conservation and Technology was created
                  in 1931, the collection’s paintings were first treated by the
                  experienced tutors and by the students under their
                  supervision. In 1998, Stephen Gritt was appointed as the first
                  Courtauld Gallery conservator, and the majority of this
                  workload shifted away from the Department.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  The students primarily worked on paintings from other museums,
                  societies, and private collections that dated from the
                  fourteenth century to modern periods, with treatments ranging
                  from surface cleaning to full lining/relining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>

                  From the 1950s, the department was involved in lining research
                  ([[Straub and Rees-Jones 1955]]). At the 1974 Greenwich
                  conference, students Hedley, Stephen Hackney, and Alan
                  Cummings presented their research work ([[Hedley, Hackney, and
                  Cummings 2003]]). Vishwa Mehra was invited to the department
                  on at least two occasions (1978 and 1981) to give workshops
                  demonstrating his cold lining technique.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  From 1982 until his untimely death in 1990, Hedley was a
                  lecturer focusing on, among other things, the mechanical
                  properties of synthetic canvases as lining supports ([[Hedley
                  and Villers 1982]]). The environment was thus favorable for
                  experimentation and development of techniques and materials
                  (e.g., [[Phenix and Hedley 1984]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>

                  Two strands emerge in the Courtauld reports: the paintings
                  from the Courtauld Gallery collection and the paintings from
                  external collections. Out of the 1,023 reports consulted from
                  1968 to 1996, 124 included structural treatment of some
                  description (approximately 12%). Only eighteen reports from
                  before 1980 were found, so the pre-1980 areas on the graphs
                  shown in figures here should be interpreted with caution due
                  to the unknown quantity of missing reports. Pre-1980 practices
                  were gathered through interviews with conservators studying or
                  working at the Courtauld during this period.

                  The vacuum envelope table developed by Hedley, Hackney, and
                  Cummings was used from the 1970s until the early 1980s
                  ([[Hedley, Hackney, and Cummings 2003|, 83]]). In 1984, a
                  commercially built lining table, based on the design created
                  in the department in the 1950s, came in as a long-term loan,
                  this was used until 1994. Subsequently a multipurpose suction
                  table with air-flow capability and a conventional hot-plate
                  top was acquired from Willard Conservation Ltd.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  Occasionally, hand linings were also undertaken.

                  CIA has a long history of using wax-resin. Waxes used were
                  beeswax, bleached beeswax, or microcrystalline wax, combined
                  with natural dammar or synthetic resins such as Ketone N or
                  AW2. These mixtures were used exclusively for lining until the
                  early 1970s, when Beva and polymer dispersion adhesives were
                  introduced. The very last wax-resin lining was performed in
                  1990 (<strong>fig. 4.7</strong>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beva was taken up shortly after the 1974 conference. Cummings
                  and Hedley had a long conversation with Gustav Berger during
                  the conference, and that discussion was key to the adoption of
                  Beva at the Courtauld.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
                  PRIMAL AC-634 was introduced to the conservation world by
                  Mehra in 1972 and began to be used at CIA soon after ([[Mehra
                  1972]]). It was used for cold linings until 1984, when
                  research conducted in the department showed its poor aging
                  properties ([[Howells et al. 1984]]). Plextol B500, also
                  introduced by Mehra, was used for cold linings until 1992.

                <p>
                  Fabri-Sil, a Teflon-impregnated glass fiber with a silicon
                  pressure adhesive, was introduced to CIA in the 1980s and
                  studied by Alan Phenix as his student research project
                  ([[Phenix and Hedley 1984]]|, 84.2.39). This product,
                  developed by Fieux, was used seven times at CIA from 1983 to
                  1989 ([[Fieux 1977]]). It was abandoned due the weakness of
                  the bond even after solvent reactivation, and its high
                  cost.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In terms of lining fabrics, CIA experimented with different
                  fabrics, almost entirely synthetics, before settling on
                  polyester sailcloth, a fabric Hedley had thoroughly researched
                  and tested ([<strong>fig. 4.8</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-8))
                  ([[Hedley and Villers 1982, 154]]). Other polyester fabrics
                  included Vylene and Permawear 122. In many treatment reports,
                  lining fabrics were referred to as “polyester” or “polyester
                  fabric,” and it is not possible to know precisely which
                  fabrics were used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Glass fiber was used from 1975 until 1981, most likely for
                  experimentation after the 1974 conference ([[Boissonnas
                  2003]]). There were also a few examples of marouflage onto
                  aluminum honeycomb. Polypropylene was used from 1979 and
                  abandoned by 1981. Lascaux P110, a textile with a similar
                  appearance to linen but made of polyester, was used from 1991
                  until 1995.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As at NMM, the adhesives used for strip-lining are Beva gel
                  and film. The fabrics used for strip-linings are mostly
                  synthetics, apart from one example in 1986 using linen.
                  Synthetics used include Permawear 122, polyester sailcloth,
                  and Lascaux P110.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In terms of loose-lining fabrics, there is more variety than
                  at NMM. While polyester sailcloth was adopted in 1984 and
                  remains in use, other fabrics were also tested. Linen was used
                  from 1985 until 1991 and could be combined with a lining onto
                  synthetic fabric for a more sympathetic appearance from the
                  reverse. Lascaux P110 took over linen from 1992 to 1995.

                  Reviewing the Courtauld paintings with the expert panel, it
                  was striking to see the widespread and enthusiastic adoption
                  of modern lining fabrics and adhesives for the treatment of
                  these works. The documentation of treatments, written in the
                  context of a research and teaching institution, often gives a
                  full insight into the decision-making processes and selection
                  of materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As already mentioned, very few paper records remain for the
                  earliest treatments. For example, the 1969 marouflage of
                  Lucien Pissarro’s <em>Le Brusq,</em> 1923 (P.1932.SC.322) onto
                  aluminum was recorded only by the materials and date inscribed
                  on the rigid support: “April 1969, 90% beeswax, 10% AW2
                  resin.” Similarly, the wax-resin lining of a fire-damaged
                  painting attributed to Giovanni Francesco Barbieri, or
                  Guercino,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  in 1976 is only recorded in a treatment database.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>
                  This lining appears to have been carried out using cotton duck
                  in a manner similar to that of the near-contemporaneous lining
                  of the Serres <em>Penobscot Bay</em> painting at the NMM.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the marouflage appeared to be an extreme intervention,
                  our expert panel remarked that this had been a popular
                  “preventative” measure in the 1960s. Chief among the problems
                  associated with marouflage was weave emphasis resulting from
                  the unyielding nature of the secondary support, an unfortunate
                  outcome in the treatment of the Pissarro. The painting appears
                  structurally sound with no apparent justification for the
                  marouflage. The work seemed to be an example of lining for
                  preventative measures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the 1980s, several Impressionist paintings, accessioned
                  from the Princes Gate bequest, were treated before they went
                  on display in the Courtauld Galleries for the first time
                  ([[Brown 1981]]). All then nearly a century old, these unlined
                  canvasses were suffering from planar distortion and
                  embrittlement. Some paintings had large areas of unpainted
                  ground and delicate impasto, which posed lining challenges.
                  Each painting was treated with a different solution, which
                  highlighted the speed of evolution of thinking in lining
                  practice at the time, as well as the intellectual flexibility
                  of the conservators.

                  Paul Cezanne’s <em>Turning Road (Route Tournante),</em> 1905
                  (P.1978.PG.61) was treated in 1980 using a low-pressure,
                  cold-lining technique learned from Mehra in 1978. The
                  adhesive, Primal A-C64 thickened with Natrosol, was applied
                  through a mesh screen. One particular concern was the danger
                  of staining and potentially darkening the ground with the
                  adhesive. The report describes painstaking spectrophotometer
                  readings, taken before and after treatment. The lining fabric
                  was polyester, Permawear 122, and the report contains
                  correspondence with the manufacturer. The deformations out of
                  plane ([<strong>fig. 4.9a</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-9))
                  were treated prior to lining by misting with water and drying
                  on the cold lining table at minimal pressure (8.5 cm water),
                  repeated three times with local weighting. The treatment was
                  deemed a success and was subsequently chosen to illustrate a
                  book in Gerry Hedley’s memory ([[Hedley 1993]]). Although it
                  was incorrectly described as a Plextol lining, the success of
                  the flattening moisture treatment and the lining in retaining
                  the improved surface is commented on in the picture caption.
                  Our expert panel agreed the lining was extremely successful in
                  terms of correcting overall distortion while keeping a very
                  light, unlined feel ([<strong>fig. 4.9b</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-9)).
                  Only one area of lifting of the lining on the turnover edge
                  was identified, but this was not felt to be an indicator of
                  more widespread failure concerns.

                  Edouard Manet’s
                  <em>Au Bal—Marguerite de Conflans en Toilette de Bal,</em>
                  1870–80 (P.1978.PG.233) was treated the following year, in
                  1981, to address the buckling of the canvas recorded in raking
                  light photographs before treatment. Caroline Villers’s
                  recommendation seemed to follow the successful precedent set
                  by the treatment of the Cezanne painting: to carry out a cold
                  lining at low pressure. A change of plan is described with
                  Villers’s typical understatement: “Although the tacking margin
                  had not seemed to exhibit exceptional sensitivity to
                  moisture…the canvas was found to be extremely responsive.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                  They switched to using Beva with sailcloth at 60°C–65°C and
                  using 12"Hg vacuum envelope pressure. The envelope system
                  was designed to avoid textural changes, and the conservators
                  also removed large slubs and residues from the reverse prior
                  to lining. However, when reviewing the treatment with the aid
                  of archive raking light images, it did seem that there had
                  been some increased weave emphasis. Despite this, the
                  treatment was published by Hedley as an exemplar treatment the
                  following year ([[Hedley and Villers 1982|, 157]]). It was
                  interesting to reflect on this treatment with the expert
                  group. It seemed to particularly highlight the change in
                  attitudes towards lining over the 38 years since this painting
                  was treated. The consensus now would be to accept the
                  deformations out of plane and to try to avoid lining for as
                  long as possible.

                  Edgar Degas’s <em>Lady with a Parasol,</em> 1870–72
                  (P.1978.PG.87) was treated almost immediately after the Manet.
                  The painting was first strip-lined using Permawear 122 and
                  Beva, but during restretching the original canvas fractured
                  along the turnover edge. At this point, close to the
                  exhibition opening, it was decided to mend the tear locally
                  and return to the painting after the show. The painting
                  returned for treatment in 1983 in preparation for considerable
                  travel as part of a loan to Japan and Australia, and the
                  decision was taken to line the painting ([<strong>fig. 4.10</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-10)).
                  Hedley, leading the treatment, selected Fabri-Sil, but adapted
                  the process to incorporate solvent activation, which was
                  concurrently investigated by Phenix in his research project
                  ([[Phenix and Hedley 1984]]). Using solvent activation, the
                  peel strength of Fabri-Sil increased to approximately match a
                  “strong wax-resin” formulation. Despite the treatment being
                  among the early Fabri-Sil linings, our inspection of the
                  painting found that the experimental method performed well:
                  the impasto looks crisp and sharp, and the ground layer
                  appears unchanged by the adhesive, with the lining remaining
                  well adhered throughout.

                <p>
                  Reflecting on past practice at both institutions, the impact
                  that the sharing of knowledge had in the years surrounding the
                  Greenwich lining conference was apparent. Both institutions
                  were enthusiastic about adopting new methods, adhesives, and
                  fabrics, underpinned by comparison with existing methods to
                  ensure that new techniques were at least as good as old. Most
                  treatments appear to have aged well thus far, although some
                  adhesives and fabrics have unknown aging characteristics in
                  the longer term.

                  The variety of adhesives used by the NMM conservators was
                  clustered around a very specific period: a few years before
                  and after the 1974 conference. As organizers, the conservators
                  wanted to explore all avenues of new materials and methods.
                  The experimentation led to the elimination of unsuitable
                  methods and materials, such as sturgeon glue linings and black
                  polypropylene as lining support, and the refinement and
                  adoption of methods and materials that fitted their collection
                  and work ethos. The Courtauld showed how research conducted
                  within the department informed choices of adhesives and
                  fabrics.

                  The rationale behind structural treatments was explored
                  through interviews with conservators and by reading the
                  archival documentation. Reviewing treatments with our expert
                  panel highlighted how much attitudes have changed over time
                  and the lasting influence of minimalism that was ushered in by
                  the Greenwich conference. Nowadays, the inclination is to
                  resist intervention until the point of complete failure. The
                  conclusion drawn from the 2019 examination was to prolong the
                  life of existing linings by shoring up failures at turnover
                  edges, reactivating old glues, or feeding in adhesive for
                  localized delamination. Future research will explore this
                  topic further by revisiting paintings identified as in need of
                  lining—but not treated in the 1970s due to time or budget
                  constraints—to assess their condition now.

                  The paper outlines the contribution of the Neapolitan
                  tradition to the structural conservation of paintings on
                  canvas. It is possible to trace the existence in the
                  eighteenth century of diversified practices, which included
                  the use of temporary stretchers for lining. It also defines
                  the <em>mesticatori-foderatori</em> (fillers-liners),
                  professionals who specialized in the preparation of new
                  canvases for painting and the lining of old ones. A profound
                  knowledge of the materials of painting during the nineteenth
                  century in the Museo Borbonico advised extreme caution in
                  interventions on glue-tempera paintings by Parmigianino and
                  Bertoja, which were not lined but equipped with additional
                  canvases. The use of transfer has been practiced since the
                  eighteenth century in Naples but has been consciously avoided
                  in the nineteenth century in the museum and only put into
                  practice at the beginning of the twentieth century, with
                  questionable results. In the second half of the twentieth
                  century an improvement to traditional lining techniques was
                  found by Antonio De Mata, who developed an effective procedure
                  for the preventive consolidation and lining of paintings on
                  canvas that reduced the risks of humidity. With due caution,
                  this method continues to be effective in many cases.

                <p>
                  The intention of this paper is to outline the important
                  contributions made by the Neapolitan tradition of structural
                  conservation of paintings on canvas, the history of which
                  remains little known. Knowledge of this tradition has
                  increased over the past twenty years thanks to studies that
                  have brought to light many documents presented during two
                  conferences held in the Capodimonte Museum in 1999 and 2007
                  (see [[Catalano and Prisco 2003]] and [[D’Alconzo 2007})}.
                  These studies made it possible to compare elements from the
                  examination of the paintings themselves, elucidating the
                  contents of the documents and allowing an understanding of the
                  methods employed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A number of interesting elements were thus brought to light,
                  such as the distinction—as early as the eighteenth
                  century—between the “artistic” operations of cleaning and
                  retouching and those of lining/consolidation, which were
                  entrusted to the “liner” rather than the “restorer.” The
                  studies highlighted the existence in the eighteenth century of
                  diverse practices in the museums, often limited to cautious
                  interventions, together with an awareness of the specificity
                  of the materials involved. Traditionally, animal glue and
                  flour paste were almost exclusively the materials employed to
                  consolidate the paint layers and line the canvases throughout
                  the period under consideration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These studies also identified the presence of certain
                  “professionals” who specialized in the preparation of new
                  canvases for painting and in the lining of old ones. The
                  history of the Chiarello, a family of
                  <em>mesticatori-foderatori</em> (filler-liners) from the
                  eighteenth to twentieth centuries, is of particular interest.

                <p>
                  The history of the profession of <em>foderatore</em> (liner)
                  in Naples sits at the intersection of craft, art, and
                  profession, and it is here where the definition of the
                  discipline of conservation-restoration unfolds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1960, Raffaello Causa—the renowned art historian who in the
                  1970s and ’80s would direct the <em>soprintendenza</em> for
                  the Historical and Artistic Heritage of Naples, and who at
                  that time headed the restoration laboratory of the Capodimonte
                  Museum, highlighted this aspect by observing how in our city
                  the conservation of paintings on canvas had been guaranteed by
                  means of “an indisputable skill—and we would like to say a
                  reckless ease—with which the lining of the canvases was
                  performed here in Naples, an operation widely practiced by
                  local restorers” ([[Causa 1960|, 10]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fact, it is possible since at least the eighteenth century
                  to trace the evidence and documents relating to the practice
                  of <em>rintelaggio</em> or <em>foderatura:</em> the
                  consolidation of deteriorated textile supports carried out by
                  gluing these onto a new canvas. We also find that such
                  activities were carried out early on by a particular figure,
                  the <em>telaiolo,</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  or manufacturer of canvases for painting, who would also
                  repair damaged canvases if required.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of these craftsmen was Giuseppe Maria Ranzenò, known as il
                  Filosofo (the Philosopher), who as early as 1726 was paid for
                  “<em>due tele imprimate</em>” (two primed canvases) ([[Pavone
                  1994|, 140]]). In 1740, he supplied some cases of canvas to
                  the Reale Arazzeria, established by Charles of Bourbon, which
                  produced many splendid tapestries for the royal residences
                  ([[Siniscalco 1979|, 278]]). The Arazzeria was based in Via
                  San Carlo alle Mortelle, together with the Pietre Dure
                  laboratory, in the same location where the Art Academy would
                  soon be born.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other testimonies regarding the activity of the Arazzeria
                  between 1761 and 1768 clarify the specificity of Ranzenò’s
                  profession. This information is found in a collection of
                  documents published in 1979 as part of a campaign of
                  wide-ranging research aimed at reconstructing the various and
                  multifaceted artistic activities of the eighteenth century,
                  thanks to a group of historians whose scholarship would come
                  together to give rise to the great
                  <em>Civiltà del Settecento a Napoli</em> exhibition in Naples
                  (December 1979–October 1980) ([[N.&nbsp;Spinosa 1979]]; [[<em>Civiltà del ’700 a Napoli</em>
                  1980]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the Reale Arazzeria, several painters, including Girolamo
                  Storace, Giuseppe Bonito, and Orlando Filippini, were engaged
                  to create oil paintings that served as a guide to tapestry
                  weaving ([<strong>figs. 5.1a</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-1)
                  and
                  [<strong>5.1b</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-1)).
                  Giuseppe Maria Ranzenò supplied them with prepared canvases on
                  which to make their models, and for this reason in the
                  documents he is called “<em>mesticatore</em>” ([[Siniscalco
                  1979|, 282]]), from <em>mestica</em>, the mixture with which
                  the canvases were prepared for painting. But we also find him
                  at work in other activities closely related to those of the
                  painters active for the Arazzeria, which he assisted with all
                  aspects relating to the preparation of the supports.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A payment note dated 1763 describes the variety of these
                  supplies. It refers to a “canvas for painting made by Giuseppe
                  Maria Ranzenò called the Philosopher, ordered by the Court
                  Painter D. Giuseppe Bonito to make the frieze of the tapestry
                  by the painter Filippini,” and the canvas is described as,
                  “with its good stretcher with the crossbar, prepared with
                  priming the color of lead white” ([[A. Spinosa 1979, 382]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A real restoration is then described of two old
                  <em>modelli</em> for the frieze. Orlando Filippini was in
                  charge of painting the patterns for the floral friezes that
                  adorned the tapestries, the main “stories” of which were then
                  entrusted to Bonito. Indeed, in 1768, the same Ranzenò would
                  still declare he had supplied Filippini with the canvases on
                  which to paint “the flowers for the friezes” ([[A. Spinosa
                  1979, 383]]). Evidently, sometimes these oil paintings that
                  served as <em>modelli</em> for the friezes were reused, and
                  this explains the restoration of the “old <em>modello</em> for
                  the frieze” mentioned in the note of 1762: “It has been lined
                  with a single piece of fine canvas and it has been filled in
                  many areas having first flattened it on a larger stretcher;
                  then it was attached to its own stretcher that was in the
                  Arazzeria” ([[A. Spinosa 1979, 382]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining procedure is described here with details rarely
                  found in the sources. The document indicates the type of
                  canvas used: “<em>fina</em>” (fine, or thin) and “a single
                  piece” (that is, without seams). It describes the use of a
                  stretcher that we would now call temporary: larger than the
                  original one, prepared specifically for the lining procedure.
                  And it tells us that the lined painting was then placed back
                  on its original stretcher.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also learn that Ranzenò filled the gaps with
                  “<em>stucco</em>” (filler), and we therefore learn that this
                  phase of the restoration was carried out by the liner himself.
                  In fact, the <em>stucco</em> used at the time for these
                  reparations was of a nature closely related to the
                  <em>mestica</em>—a mixture of oil and pigments with which new
                  canvases were prepared for painting (applied over a layer of
                  animal glue plus other ingredients such as flour, starch,
                  sugar). And as mentioned, Ranzenò is described precisely as a
                  <em>mesticatore.</em> The profession of one who prepares
                  canvases for painting was evidently already well defined at
                  the time and closely linked to that of the supplier of
                  canvases and stretchers—and finally to that of a liner and
                  repairer of canvases. The profession that we would call
                  restorer, but it was at the time—and for a long time
                  after—reserved for the operations considered more “noble”: the
                  “restoration” was the pictorial one, of the painting surface,
                  and the specific task of the artist. It was not yet
                  autonomous.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Paradoxically, however—precisely because it belonged to a
                  subordinate profession that lacked pretensions to artistry—the
                  type of restoration that we would call conservative, related
                  to the mending and lining of the canvas, already appears in
                  the mid‑eighteenth century with characteristics and methods
                  that have been perpetuated (with necessary adjustments), up to
                  the present day.

                  The Eighteenth-Century Restorations for the Royal Museum
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In the years 1758 and 1759, Ranzenò was engaged in the
                  restoration of the paintings from the Royal Collection housed
                  in the Palace of Capodimonte, where he directed two
                  <em>stiratori</em> (ironers), Nicola di Mauro and Pasquale
                  Senzapaura, who in this case worked exclusively on the
                  repairing and relining of canvases ([[Filangieri di Candida
                  1902|, 225]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In these years, Father Giovanni Maria della Torre was the
                  custodian of the Farnese Collection in the palace, and in
                  charge of setting up the gallery. In a letter in which he
                  gives an account of the work on the paintings, he describes
                  the intervention of the ironers as follows: “The
                  <em>accomodamento</em> [repair] of them consists in tensioning
                  again, repairing, and changing the canvases, and working on
                  them. All this is carried out by <em>manuali</em> [skilled
                  workers].”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is a further subdivision of the work. “The other part of
                  the <em>accomodamento</em> consists of filling the holes of
                  which there are many, making good the flaking […] with the
                  utmost diligence and skill by means of the
                  <em>stucco a colore</em> [colored filler].”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  This operation is assigned to Andrea Liano, an artist of
                  limited prestige who dedicated himself to the diligent repair
                  of paint losses, recovering the unity of the paintings; as a
                  result, they are deemed “so perfect that they do not require
                  anything further.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  Although it is difficult to identify with certainty
                  restorations of this historical moment and situation, we can
                  very frequently identify paintings that contain traces of
                  restorations dating back to the eighteenth century in which
                  the losses are filled with a material composed of oil and
                  earth pigments, completely similar to the preparation applied
                  on the canvases at the time. We can imagine that this phase,
                  carried out with care, effectively recovered the material—and
                  even chromatic continuity, to a certain extent—of the
                  painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contrast to the assessment of the <em>accomodamento</em>,
                  the artistic restoration, entrusted to the court painter
                  Clemente Ruta, is questioned by della Torre, who reports the
                  critical opinion of the connoisseurs (<em>Intendenti</em>): “I
                  therefore do not see what else is desirable for these same
                  paintings, and consequently I do not see any need for the
                  painter D. Clemente Ruta to bring them to the Royal Palace of
                  Naples, if not to give them a brushstroke or two, or some
                  varnish, which in the opinion of all the
                  <em>Intendenti</em> is to alter the old paintings.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A distinct intermediate activity was therefore taking shape—if
                  not conservation, exactly, perhaps adjusting or repairing—a
                  field of action somewhere between lining and artistic
                  restoration in which both Ranzenò and his collaborator
                  Senzapaura—the latter also called the Philosopher in his
                  turn—were involved. Between 1762 and 1775, the two were
                  engaged in the restoration of the copper paintings by
                  Domenichino, Ribera, and Stanzione in the Cappella del Tesoro
                  of San Gennaro in Naples Cathedral. The restoration of the
                  paintings on copper would have included a cleaning but also
                  probably consolidation of the flaking layers of paint, a
                  consistently recurring conservation problem throughout the
                  history of the numerous interventions on the seven great
                  altarpieces (see [[Cerasuolo 2010|, 113]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A few years later we see the emergence of the
                  <em>telaiolo</em> Pasquale Chiariello, the first exponent of a
                  family of restorers whose names we meet over a very broad span
                  of time, from the late eighteenth to the second half of the
                  twentieth century. In 1796, the latter supplied prepared
                  canvases to the painter Tischbein: “Six
                  <em>tele impresse</em> were delivered by the
                  <em>telajolo</em> Pasquale Chiariello to the Director of the
                  Royal Academy of Painting, D. Guglielmo Tischbein, to paint
                  figures on them” ([[Cerasuolo 2007|, 29]]). From that date
                  until almost to our own times, the activity of the Chiariello
                  family as manufacturers of canvases and as liners unfolds
                  seamlessly. From 1826 to 1828 we find repeated references to
                  the “<em>foderatori Raffaele e Antonio Chiariello</em>”
                  engaged in work for the preparation of the Real Museo
                  Borbonico ([[Catalano 2007]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the 1820s, in the preparation for the opening of the museum
                  in the rooms of Palazzo degli Studi (the current Museo
                  Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli), an intense campaign of
                  restorations was undertaken, for which many important
                  documents have survived, such as notes drawn up in order to
                  estimate the necessary expenses ([[D’Alconzo 2003]]). For the
                  “canvas paintings of the Neapolitan School” a summary table
                  lists the paintings (thirty-two works, including ones by
                  Jusepe de Ribera, Luca Giordano, Salvator Rosa, and Aniello
                  Falcone), and links them over three columns to the list of
                  operations envisaged: “<em>Foderatura e tutt’altro occorre al completo</em>” (Lining and anything else is needed in full), “<em>Spianatura a colla e rassetto in telaro</em>” (Glue leveling and rearrangement on the stretcher), “<em>Telari a zeppe</em>” (Stretchers with wedges)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  (see [[Cerasuolo 2008|, 28]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The operations described in the first two columns are
                  obviously alternatives. In fact, in less serious cases, in
                  place of the lining, only the <em>spianatura</em> operation
                  would be performed. From other documents we can better
                  understand what this “flattening” consisted of: the
                  consolidation of the paint layers carried out by applying
                  animal glue—the “strong glue” traditionally used for this
                  purpose and also used for the lining—on the reverse of the
                  canvas, without removing the painting from the stretcher, and
                  then ironing it in this way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The application on a new stretcher, “<em>a</em>
                  <em>zeppe</em>”—that is, with triangular wedges that allow the
                  canvas to be put back under tension—is almost systematically
                  proposed for lined paintings but could occasionally also be
                  carried out for those subjected to “flattening” only<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  (see [[Cerasuolo 2008|, 28]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, an expense report, for the treatment of Ribera’s
                  <em>Drunken Silenus</em>, describes the operation as follows:
                  “flattening from the front of the painting, glue on the back,
                  stretched onto the new frame and fully adjusted.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is interesting to observe that diversified practices are
                  adopted, but always implemented with materials compatible with
                  those originally used, and at the same time to note that
                  harmful practices were not employed, even though they were
                  widespread in other contemporary contexts, especially in
                  northern Europe. Such practices include the application of
                  <em>beveroni</em> (see [[Conti 2007|, 106]]), oily substances
                  of various natures applied to the reverse of canvases in order
                  to consolidate and revive their colors—which, however, over
                  time caused irreversible darkening of the tones and
                  contraction of the pictorial layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the Real Museo of Naples also, we see that both the lining
                  and the operations relating to the carpentry of the paintings
                  on panel were practiced by professional figures distinct from
                  the “restorers” who were entrusted with the operations deemed
                  more noble, namely, cleaning and pictorial restoration. The
                  work of these operators was often assessed separately,
                  although sometimes the payment was made through the party who
                  took care of the “artistic” part of the intervention
                  ([[Cerasuolo 2008|, 28]]).

                  A Family Tradition: The Chiariello
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In the middle of the nineteenth century, we meet Francesco
                  Chiariello working for the Real Museo. He was an important
                  person who proudly claimed the rights of the profession of
                  <em>telaiolo</em>. Chiariello became very popular among
                  Neapolitan artists of the time, acquiring a singular
                  reputation and importance—so much so that he is remembered by
                  various writers as an authoritative adviser. In the memoirs of
                  the life of the painter Bernardo Celentano, written by his
                  brother Luigi, for example, we find many references to him.
                  Bernardo buys his canvases from Chiariello—indeed in a letter
                  from Rome he considers the possibility of having a large
                  canvas sent from Naples, and we learn the address of his shop,
                  in Via Fosse del Grano, in the neighborhood called Museo. An
                  unusual episode then shows the ease with which Chiariello
                  offers himself to help the novice artist Bernardo in solving a
                  problem of perspective, involving for this purpose a very
                  young Domenico Morelli ([[Cerasuolo 2007|, 32–33]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A lively description by Vittorio Imbriani also allows us to
                  identify the portrait of Francesco Chiariello—called by the
                  diminutive Ciccio—in a gentleman depicted by Giovanni
                  Ponticelli in the historical painting
                  <em>The Convalescent Cavalier Bajardo</em>, presented in 1867
                  in the exhibition
                  <em>Quinta Promotrice Napoletana</em> ([<strong>fig. 5.2</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-2)).
                  Imbriani produced a booklet to accompany the exhibition (which
                  is later cited by the eminent historian and philosopher
                  Benedetto Croce), and it includes a description of the
                  <em>telaiolo</em>: “Ciccio Chiariello, the medal-winning
                  <em>telaiuolo</em> who supplies canvas to all the painters of
                  Naples, richly disguised as an Italian gentleman of the times,
                  is observing the scene” ([[Cerasuolo 2007|, 25–26]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>telaiolo</em> referred to in the description clearly
                  highlights the characteristics that make his figure singular,
                  in some way unique, in the nineteenth-century Neapolitan
                  artistic scene: he provides canvas on which to paint “to all
                  the painters of Naples,” and he is so highly thought of as to
                  be honored with awards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Francesco Chiariello had in fact received a silver medal as a
                  prize in the Solenne Mostra Industriale of 1853, the last of
                  the major biannual exhibitions dedicated to the products of
                  the National Industry of the Bourbon Kingdom. These
                  exhibitions, held by the Reale Istituto d’Incoraggiamento,
                  were aimed at encouraging entrepreneurs’ initiative and
                  supporting the manufacturing activities that had once been
                  promoted and financed by the royal court.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The exhibition of 1853 divided the exhibits into five
                  categories: Chiariello exhibited his “<em>tele buone da dipingere</em>” (good canvases for painting) in the class collectively
                  described as “different objects” and was awarded the Silver
                  Medal “for the improvement of canvases for painting,” as we
                  read in the relative *Disamina—*a report of the examination
                  made by the commission of Reale Istituto. After an interesting
                  excursus on the various types of canvas congenial to the
                  different inclinations of the artists, the “<em>artiere Chiariello</em>” is praised for his ability to prepare canvases of various
                  fabrics and preparations “corresponding to the wishes of our
                  painters.” ([[Reale Istituto d’Incoraggiamento 1855|,
                  231–32]]; see also [[Cerasuolo 2007|, 30–32]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this context, the social elevation of the “craftsman
                  Chiariello” suggests a new awareness of the dignity of the
                  artisan craft and the value of entrepreneurial skills, and
                  speaks to the personal esteem and friendship of the artists to
                  whom he supplied the “good canvases”—a guarantee of the
                  durability of their works.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Francesco was evidently proud of these medals, so much so that
                  in a plea presented to the king to claim his rights as
                  “manufacturer of canvas for painting, and liner of
                  paintings”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  he cited the entire text praising him that lay behind his
                  award from the Reale Istituto d’Incoraggiamento. In his plea
                  he asked to be named “Foderatore del Real Museo Borbonico” and
                  claimed as his right—“acquired with great labor”—the exercise
                  of the profession of liner. He also complained that “often
                  restorers”—clearly those who dealt with “artistic”
                  restoration—“allow themselves, to the detriment of art, to put
                  onto canvas paintings that should by rights have been handed
                  to the petitioner.” In addition to the services already
                  offered to the Real Museo, he cited as a credential the “large
                  silver medal” won in the public exhibition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Francesco Chiariello’s familiarity and friendship with
                  Neapolitan artists—foremost among these Domenico Morelli and
                  Giuseppe Palizzi—will be testified to, at a much later date,
                  by the certificates his son Pasquale obtained in order to
                  promote the elevation in his social status. This enterprising
                  son, in fact, succeeded in obtaining a further prestigious
                  award from King Vittorio Emanuele III in 1901: the concession
                  to “display the Royal Crest on the sign of his studio,” which
                  together with the medals won in public exhibitions will
                  prominently feature on his letterhead (see [<strong>fig. 5.3</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-3)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Permission to display the royal crest was gained thanks to an
                  impressive list of accolades by the best-known artists and
                  scholars of the time. Reference letters were signed between
                  1896 and 1900 by Domenico Morelli, Filippo Palizzi, Giulio De
                  Petra, Vittorio Spinazzola, and Vincenzo Caprile; a group of
                  professors from the Royal Institute of Fine Arts signed a
                  collective document that reads, “for a long time . . . the
                  paintings in need of lining or restorations are entrusted
                  exclusively to him either at the Real Istituto di Belle Arti
                  or by the Museo Nazionale, the Museo di San Martino, and the
                  Pinacoteca Reale of Naples.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  These reference letters also refer to Pasquale’s father, and
                  it is emphasized that the son, in the excellence of the
                  results, “even surpassed Francesco Chiariello himself, who was
                  his father and teacher, and was the first in this genre.” They
                  further highlight that “Chiariello always successfully
                  maintained the name of his father as the first preparer of
                  canvases for painting,” and on the quality of these canvases
                  they add interesting observations: “These canvases of special
                  and varied preparations have the characteristics of excellent
                  fabrics, the right amount of material and aging, so that they
                  are not subject to cracking, and the painting that the artist
                  executes on it does not alter with time, as is often seen with
                  poorly prepared and improperly aged canvases.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The emphasis is therefore placed on a direct relationship
                  between the guarantee of durability ensured by the excellence
                  of the products prepared by Chiariello and his ability to
                  restore this durability to damaged old paintings.

                  Knowledge of Materials and Careful Interventions
                </h2>
                <p>
                  To great expertise in the practice of lining, Neapolitan
                  liners added a profound knowledge of the materials of
                  painting, which during the nineteenth century advised extreme
                  caution in interventions. We have found evidence—both material
                  and documentary—of interesting interventions in the case of
                  two glue-tempera paintings: Parmigianino’s
                  <em>Holy Family,</em> and Bertoja’s
                  <em>Virgin and Child</em> ([<strong>figs. 5.4</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-4)

                  respectively) ([[Cardinali et al. 2002]]). Both interventions
                  are notable in their sensitive attention to the behavior of
                  the materials involved. In these two beautiful canvases, the
                  rare qualities provided by the medium have been preserved
                  thanks to the care taken, which ensured their good
                  conservation, and which is still effective today.

                  A document signed by the restorer Pasquale Chiariello dated
                  September 6, 1899, lists the “lining works” he carried out in
                  the National Museum of Naples. In the same list it is
                  specified that the paintings defined as
                  <em>guazzi</em> (glue-tempera paintings) “were only put behind
                  glass and ‘conditioned’ in order to avoid further damage.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The examination of the paintings revealed that the canvases of
                  the Bertoja and of the Parmigianino were not lined but
                  equipped with an additional canvas: both have been
                  “conditioned” in a similar way: using a densely woven fabric,
                  not glued, but only stretched on the reverse for protective
                  purposes, and fixed to the edges with nails that also tension
                  the original canvas ([<strong>fig. 5.6</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-6)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The edges of the canvases were fixed with strips of wood
                  nailed along the perimeter to the stretcher and then wrapped
                  with a glued paper. The stretchers, from different and

                  Glue-tempera makes colors look soft and light and is easily
                  spoiled by the application of varnish or oily materials. In
                  fact, glue, although relatively strong as a binder, does not
                  form a continuous, even film on the surface, which therefore
                  is quite porous. As a result, the colors once dried appear
                  lighter and less saturated than when wet (see [[Cerasuolo
                  2017|, 220–30]]; [[Cerasuolo 2019]]).

                  A conscious and attentive protective intervention driven by
                  the same care was taken with the two <em>Tüchlein</em> by
                  Bruegel, which were placed under the glass as a preventive
                  measure, rejecting the choice of more invasive interventions
                  so as not to distort the optical qualities of the medium (see
                  [[Cerasuolo 2017|, 220–30]]; [[Cerasuolo 2019]]).

                  The documents testify to a remarkable awareness of the
                  conservation problems posed by these works, which resulted in
                  efforts of a purely conservative nature, thus avoiding the
                  risks entailed by intrusive interventions. In 1846, Camillo
                  Guerra, a professor of painting, wrote to the director of the
                  museum reporting on the poor condition of the two Bruegels. In
                  an 1847 document in reference to one of the two paintings, he
                  wrote that “as it is painted in glue-tempera it is more easily
                  subject to deterioration.” On May 13, 1853, the Commissione
                  dei Restauri (the commission of artists who supervised
                  restorations at the Museum) took the decision “to put behind
                  glass the two tempera paintings by Pieter Bruegel, which are
                  kept in the Dutch school” (see [[Cerasuolo 2019]]).

                  The Transfer: Ancient Testimonies and Dangerous Practices
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Another important aspect of the caution shown by the museum
                  administration concerns the practice of transfer, which was
                  consciously avoided in the nineteenth century in the Museo
                  Borbonico thanks to the awareness of its dangers. We find a
                  clear testimony of this in a document dated 1810: Michele
                  Arditi strongly opposed Paolino Girgenti, who wanted to
                  transfer the <em>Strage degli Innocenti</em> by Andrea
                  Vaccaro, in order to eliminate the imperfection caused by the
                  seam joining the two pieces of canvas ([[D’Alconzo and Prisco
                  2005|, 84]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The practice of transfer was carried out very early in Naples,
                  since at least the eighteenth century. In 1742, Bernardo De
                  Dominici recounted the skill of two Neapolitan artists, Nicolò
                  di Simone and Alessandro Majello, who specialized in the
                  transfer of flaking paintings on panel onto canvas supports
                  ([[De Dominici [1742–43] 2003–14|, 796, 994]], cited in
                  [[Conti 2007|, 140]]).

                  The restoration of a painting by Fedele Fischetti,
                  <em>Noli Me Tangere</em>, from the church of Santa Caterina da
                  Siena ([<strong>fig. 5.7a</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-7)),
                  in 1998,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  enabled us to examine a material example of a partial transfer
                  procedure, probably carried out by the artist himself during
                  the execution of the painting, which can be traced back to
                  1766–1767. There are documents that refer to Fischetti’s
                  activity as a restorer ([[Nappi 1984|, 320]]), but in this
                  case it was possible to verify the procedure carried out long
                  ago directly on a painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Observation in raking light before restoration showed a clear
                  difference in the surface of the whole lower part of the
                  painting, which was smoother and more adherent to the canvas,
                  while in the upper part, lifting of the poorly adhering paint
                  layers was visible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting appeared to have been lined a long time ago, and
                  the adhesion of the lining canvas was no longer effective. But
                  when the restorer proceeded to remove the lining canvas, she
                  realized that in reality only the lower part retained the
                  original canvas, while in the upper part the pictorial layers
                  were glued directly to the canvas applied during the old
                  restoration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Evidently—probably following an accident—the painter had
                  needed to restore his own painting, which was adhering poorly
                  to the canvas. He had then removed the canvas from the
                  affected part and glued to it a new canvas of a very similar
                  weave to the original, while throughout the lower part he had
                  continued the gluing over the earlier canvas, where it had not
                  been necessary to remove it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The fact that the intervention had been carried out by the
                  artist himself is deduced from the nature of the canvas and
                  from the fact that the gaps in the upper part are filled with
                  an oily mixture quite similar to the original, applied from
                  the back—underneath the lining canvas—and the color applied on
                  the front over these fillings is similar to the original in
                  the handling of the brushstrokes and color scheme, but
                  slightly obscured in these areas. [<strong>Fig. 5.7b</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-7)
                  shows the areas affected by these “integrations.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The practice of transfer—often claimed by restorers to be a
                  secret capable of saving deteriorated paintings—causes more
                  problems than it solves, as is now well understood. Although
                  in the nineteenth century it was banned during restoration in
                  the Real Museo Borbonico, it was unfortunately no longer
                  avoided in the early twentieth century. In the years leading
                  up to the 1960s, the transfer of easel paintings was
                  considered a way of giving paintings greater durability (much
                  like the <em>strappo</em> technique used with frescoes), so
                  much so that it was also approved by rigorous ministerial
                  circulars, and indeed it was practiced repeatedly, with
                  questionable results. If the operation could have been carried
                  out without very serious consequences for Neapolitan
                  seventeenth-century paintings, which are characterized by
                  remarkably thick and compact preparatory layers—(although even
                  there it actually impoverished the paint layer and its
                  texture), in other cases the consequences of these
                  interventions were truly deleterious. This was the case with
                  Titian’s <em>Paolo III col Camauro.</em> Titian famously
                  painted directly onto lightly prepared canvas, and
                  <em>Paolo III</em> was seriously damaged by the transfer
                  carried out by Stanislao Troiano in 1932 ([[A. Cerasuolo
                  2013|, 197]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the first half of the twentieth century, Pasquale
                  Chiariello and his sons Umberto and Raffaele also carried out
                  many transfers (not always with positive results), while they
                  successfully continued the activities of the family business
                  and extending them to all “restoration”
                  operations—perpetuating the traditional practice of flour
                  paste lining ([[Cerasuolo 2007|, 41]]).

                  The Twentieth Century: The Experience of Antonio De Mata
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Finally, in the second half of the twentieth century,
                  improvements to traditional lining techniques with
                  <em>colla pasta</em> (glue paste) were developed by Antonio De
                  Mata ([[Cerasuolo 2008|, 40–42]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                  De Mata personally took care of the lining and the cleaning
                  and restoration. In his vision, structural conservation was
                  not a subordinate phase but together with the other phases of
                  conservation/restoration contributed to the aesthetic recovery
                  of the materiality of a work. He developed a temporary
                  stretcher with adjustable tie-rods that allowed a canvas’s
                  tension to be controlled by loosening and tightening as
                  necessary. He also devised a procedure for the preventive
                  consolidation of paintings on canvas. After freeing the
                  surface from dust and foreign matter, animal glue was
                  gradually applied on the back, in several stages, if
                  necessary, keeping the canvas fixed at the edges. This
                  procedure, which was completed by ironing the painting from
                  the back, reduced the risks of humidity and allowed the
                  improvement of the surface of the paint film without damaging
                  its material qualities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The procedure is particularly suitable for solving the
                  conservation problems of Neapolitan paintings on canvas of the
                  seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with their thick, rigid
                  preparation layers. Indeed, the animal glues and
                  flour—materials that have always been used for preparing
                  canvases before applying the oil ground and the oil-bound
                  paint layers (see [[Cerasuolo 2017|, 240–41]]; [[Véliz 1982,
                  50–51]]), are highly compatible with the original ones, and
                  are able to effectively consolidate old master paintings on
                  canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Comparing the condition of many paintings in the Capodimonte
                  Museum that have been lined in the last fifty years—as well as
                  documented and continuously monitored—makes it possible to
                  evaluate the positive outcome of these linings over time. In
                  many cases this method continues to be effective, and some
                  restorers who learned directly from De Mata and continued his
                  practice, can still teach us much about the behavior of
                  materials and intervention techniques. To preserve a
                  testimony, a meeting was organized in January 2014: an
                  interview with the restorers of that generation, recording
                  their memories and observations, in order to capture a
                  tradition that has been too often left unrecorded.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  The recovery of these procedures, insofar as they can be
                  effective and safe, will hopefully be a task and a legacy of
                  the new generations.

                  The Russian school of oil painting conservation has come a
                  long way since the 1960s—from applying only traditional
                  structural treatment techniques with water-based adhesives to
                  accepting modern approaches and synthetic polymer materials.
                  This article is devoted to the milestones achieved during this
                  process. Transformation of traditional lining methods is
                  discussed, including changes in procedure and formulations.
                  The paper also covers the development of less invasive
                  conservation techniques (such as tear mending, sizing, and
                  hydrophobization) and putting them into practice.

                <p>
                  The tradition of Russian conservation officially started in
                  1743, when the German artist Lucas Conrad Pfandzelt came to
                  Saint Petersburg to care for the royal painting gallery.
                  During the first decades of its existence, conservators
                  established main principles that were retained for about two
                  centuries. One of these was sticking to a complex structural
                  treatment that would always include such serious interventions
                  as transferring paintings from their original supports and, of
                  course, lining ([[Alyoshin 1989|, 55]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  For a very long time after the October Socialist Revolution of
                  1917, conservation in Russia developed in isolation from the
                  rest of the world. With the beginning of the thaw period in
                  Soviet culture (from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s) the
                  sphere of heritage preservation experienced significant
                  evolution, and the restoration community started to wander
                  away from techniques developed in the nineteenth century. In
                  1957, with the founding of the All-Union Central Research
                  Laboratory for Conservation and Restoration of Museum
                  Valuables,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  conservation science in Russia gained impetus; however, it was
                  not until the 1960s that conservators of easel paintings were
                  able to access professional literature and scientific events
                  from abroad to learn about methods used in current practice by
                  their foreign colleagues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These developments coincided with the advances in the chemical
                  industry—all of which set the stage for big changes in the
                  conservation field in Russia. Analyzing professional
                  scientific journals published in GOSNIIR in the 1960s,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  we can see a deep interest in chemical research into the
                  objects. The use of new synthetic materials for consolidation,
                  the study of biocide agents, and the use of new conservation
                  equipment such as vacuum hot tables were discussed. During
                  this period worldwide experience was collected and evaluated.
                  Some of the journal issues were devoted solely to reviewing
                  specialized essays for museum conservation professionals.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the 1960s to the 1980s, Soviet conservators reviewed,
                  created, and adapted structural conservation techniques, some
                  of which were considered to be a quantum leap in our country.
                  At that time, the most flourishing branch was on the track of
                  choosing noninvasive methods (as they were understood then).
                  Despite some new approaches introduced to the professional
                  community during the Greenwich conference on comparative
                  lining techniques ([[Villers 2003b]]), Soviet conservators
                  would not turn away from natural materials and traditional
                  methods. But the aim to make treatments less invasive and more
                  reversible triggered a significant number of research
                  projects. Such operations as tear mending, consolidation of
                  the flaking paint layer, and improvement of deformations were
                  reconceived in order to avoid dipping canvases in collagen
                  adhesives and to delay lining for as long as possible.

                  Transformations of Traditional Lining Technique
                </h2>
                <p>
                  From the beginning of 1960s until the mid-1980s, attention was
                  particularly given to the traditional lining technique. A lot
                  of experiments were undertaken to work out best recipes
                  ([[Lelekova 1966|, 107–8]]) or to pick plasticizers.
                  Historically, natural honey was used for this purpose, but its
                  effects and properties in lining compounds were always
                  questioned. In 1960, research on different lining adhesives
                  was published in which specialists from State Central Arts and
                  Conservation Studios<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  discussed shrinkage of sturgeon glue films, both pure and with
                  added different plasticizers. As a result of their
                  experiments, the authors proposed using polyvinyl alcohol with
                  glycerin, as these materials guarantee a more predictable
                  effect, whereas the plasticizing properties of honey were
                  considered insignificant and very much dependent on the amount
                  of sucrose in its composition ([[Trostyanskaya, Tomashevich,
                  and Sorokina 1960|, 181–82]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, the results of this research were not widely applied
                  in practice. New instructions and publications would still
                  recommend that conservators use compounds for lining made up
                  of different proportions of sturgeon glue and honey. For
                  example, Margarita Alekseyeva and Zinaida Tcherkasova in an
                  article on aqueous lining solutions mention all the known
                  drawbacks of sturgeon glue–honey compounds but still include
                  the recipes in their guidelines ([[Alekseyeva and Tcherkasova
                  1968|, 19–21]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The authors offer two practical methods of performing the
                  process of lining canvases. The first is based on a recipe
                  with a 1:1 ratio of honey to the dry sturgeon glue, by weight.
                  It suggests that the lining canvas be glued three times: the
                  first two with a 4%–8% solution and the third with an 8%–10%
                  solution. All three layers of glue should be dried in
                  sequence. The original canvas is covered with a 3%–6% water
                  solution of sturgeon glue with honey. After it dries, a second
                  layer of 8%–10% solution is applied. And as this second layer
                  becomes tacky, the two canvases are joined, evenly pressed
                  together, and ironed using warm and cold irons alternately
                  until the condensed moisture stops being released.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second method is based on a recipe with 2:1 ratio of dry
                  sturgeon glue to honey, again by weight. The lining canvas is
                  prepared with two layers of warm 6%–8% solution of sturgeon
                  glue and honey. The original canvas of the painting is infused
                  with the same compound from one to five times, with each layer
                  being allowed to dry between coats. Before the lining
                  procedure, both canvases would be infused with a 12%–17%
                  solution prepared in a proportion of 2–3:1 of dry sturgeon
                  glue and honey, respectively. As the layers on both canvases
                  become tacky, they are joined evenly and left to dry in a
                  vertical position for three to six hours. After that, the
                  canvases are ironed using warm and cold irons alternately
                  until the condensed moisture stops being released
                  ([[Alekseyeva and Tcherkasova 1968|, 22]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Several years later these methods and their variations were
                  included by Ivan Gorin and Zinaida Tcherkasova in chapter of a
                  text for art colleges teaching conservation; it remained the
                  most popular guide to practical restoration for at least 20
                  years ([[Gorin and Tcherkasova 1977|, 126]]). Interestingly,
                  it also has chapters on structural treatments with wax-resin
                  adhesives that were already falling out of practice by that
                  time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1974, Larissa Yashkina made a presentation at Greenwich
                  conference, basing her speech on a variation of the first
                  method described above, though she offered slightly different
                  formulations of the lining compounds and gave more technical
                  details about the procedure ([[Yashkina 2003]]). It was a more
                  common method at that time, and considered to be more
                  reliable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Further investigations on sturgeon-glue lining compounds were
                  conducted in 1970s and 1980s. In 1975, Roza Yabrova presented
                  a paper discussing some new materials for plasticizing
                  sturgeon glue ([[Yabrova 1975]]). Her comparative research
                  showed that such additives as polyethylene glycol (trade name
                  PEG 600), carbamide, and sorbitol could replace natural honey,
                  without all its problems and drawbacks. But traditions seem to
                  extremely strong among the Russian conservators, as none of
                  these materials were adopted in standard practice, so later
                  research continued to focus on sturgeon-honey solutions—as
                  well as concentrating on solving the problem of collagen glues
                  being prone to biodeterioration ([[Nazarova 1984]]; [[Nazarova
                  and Potapov 1984]]; [[Rebrikova 2013]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nowadays traditional lining technique is still one of the most
                  common methods of consolidation of original canvas supports of
                  the paintings. But during the past ten years there has been a
                  significant change in the whole procedure. First of all,
                  sturgeon has become an endangered species in Russia—since 2013
                  it has been protected by a federal law that limits sturgeon
                  fishing and processing. The State Research Institute for
                  Restoration has studied rabbit-skin glue an as alternative to
                  sturgeon glue and came to the conclusion that if used in
                  less-concentrated solutions, rabbit-skin glue can be
                  successfully applied to consolidate paint and ground layers
                  and also used for lining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>

                  Moreover, there is now a trend toward reducing the amount of
                  additives in the lining compounds. As the storage and exhibit
                  conditions in Russian museums have generally become more
                  stable—with balanced temperature and humidity—there is no need
                  to add biocides and plasticizers during each treatment. Case
                  studies demonstrate good results for paintings that were
                  treated with collagen glue solutions without honey
                  ([[Alyoshkina 2015]]; [[Voronina 2019]]; [[Yurovetskaya
                  2016]]).

                  Treatments to Postpone Lining
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In the 1970s and 1980s, leading studios and institutions
                  evolved new methods of preserving linen canvases that are
                  still widely used in conservation practice in Russia. One of
                  the most vivid examples is a tear-mending technique developed
                  at the State Research Institute for Restoration (GOSNIIR) in
                  the 1970s that is still widely used by conservators throughout
                  the country ([[Surovov and Yashkina 1979]]). It suggests that
                  tears and cuts of the textile painting supports are treated
                  with 5% solution of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) in ethanol or
                  isopropanol. Saturated threads are interwoven and after drying
                  are fixed using a hot spatula. This adhesive has been widely
                  used in conservation practice in Russia since 1950s
                  ([[Rumyantsev 1953]]), especially for treating murals,
                  ceramics, and fabric painting supports. Its glass transition
                  temperature (Tg) is approximately 60°C–70°C. “PVB films are
                  resistant to light and heat-sealable at temperatures above
                  120°C.…PVB films are noted for their biostable and abrasion
                  resistance properties as well as for good colorfastness
                  against ultraviolet light, low static generation, and low
                  water absorbtion” ([[Sannikova 2018|, 106]]). In 2008, the
                  tear-mending technique was slightly extended by adjusting the
                  method for strip-lining two-sided paintings to avoid overlaps
                  of new margins over the paint layer ([[Yashkina and Churakova
                  2013]]). The working procedure has also slightly changed.
                  Following a general trend holding that less is more,
                  conservators tend to use less adhesive for the process:
                  instead of saturating canvas around the tears, they just apply
                  it to the direct spots.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A method of stabilizing canvases by starch sizing was
                  introduced by conservators of the Tretyakov gallery and came
                  into common practice as a procedure for conserving canvas
                  ([[Yushkevich 1995]]). The technique was first developed in
                  1970s but was not published until the mid-1990s, being
                  constantly improved in the interim by its author, Galina
                  Yushkevich.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before performing the operation, the picture must be stretched
                  on paper margins; the painting layer should be fully covered
                  by the facing. These precautions guarantee that the canvas of
                  the painting is kept from shrinking during treatment, which
                  involves heat and moisture. Afterwards, the painting is put
                  face down on a flannel or a woven felt to protect the impasto.
                  Sizing is performed by applying a 10% starch paste on the
                  reverse of the picture and spreading it evenly. After the
                  paste dries a little it is delicately removed with a palette
                  knife. The small amount of remaining starch is pressed with a
                  warm iron. This causes the residue of the paste to be absorbed
                  into the structure of the picture, which helps reduce canvas
                  deformations and makes the support less responsive to changes
                  in temperature and humidity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This method is also very effective for removing deformations,
                  so it was adopted by many conservators and is still widely
                  used in many studios. However, during the past few years this
                  method has been reevaluated. Saturating canvas with starch
                  ultimately makes the linen fibers more brittle and prone to
                  microbiological damage. Nowadays cellulose ethers are mostly
                  substituted for the starch; this also functions to better
                  adsorb dust and glue residues from the canvas ([[Churakova,
                  Karasyova, and Yurovetskaya 2018, 56]]), but such total
                  saturation of fabric support is still questionable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the late 1980s, another interesting technique used to
                  stabilize canvas supports was introduced by GOSNIIR:
                  hydrophobization of textile supports with solutions of
                  organosilicons in isopropanol or refined gasoline
                  ([[Malachevskaya and Yashkina 1986]]). Two coats of a 5%
                  solution of polymethylhydrosiloxane are applied by brushing or
                  spraying onto the reverse side of the picture sixty minutes
                  apart. This coats the textile fibers and reduces the canvas’s
                  response to changes in temperature and humidity. The process
                  of polymerization is usually finished after eight to ten days
                  of exposure, when the solvent evaporates. The properties of
                  organosilicons (such as polymethylhydrosiloxane) still allow
                  for later protein glue treatments, including sturgeon glue
                  linings ([[Fedoseeva 1999, 68–69]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Evaluating methods of hydrophobization of canvases with
                  solutions of organosilicons seems to be a more complicated
                  task for now. All tests performed with the samples showed very
                  good results. According to publications on the project,
                  treated canvases quickly repel surface moisture, do not get
                  wet, are not prone to shrinkage and deformation, and withstand
                  sharp increases in humidity ([[Nazarova, Malachevskaya, and
                  Yashkina 1990]]). Moreover, the air and vapor permeability of
                  canvases did not change ([[Malachevskaya and Yashkina 2013]]).
                  However, when this treatment was applied to the paintings, it
                  turned out that on some artworks the consolidation operations
                  with water-based solutions were not as effective as they were
                  on the untreated with organosilicon objects. Moreover, the
                  process of degradation of polymethylhydrosiloxane is still to
                  be investigated.

                <p>
                  We did not have an industry dedicated to conservation products
                  in the former Soviet Union, nor do we currently have one in
                  Russia. None of the polymers that have been studied, tested,
                  and applied were produced specifically for conservation
                  purposes; all of them were created for the production sector
                  and then adapted to conservation needs. In the 1990s, not only
                  the political but also the economic life of our country
                  underwent serious changes after the collapse of the Soviet
                  Union. Many manufacturers either closed or changed production
                  technology, afterwards offering new materials to the market.
                  At the same time, importation of European and American
                  conservation materials started to grow, so people working in
                  the conservation and restoration sphere suddenly had a broad
                  selection of totally new polymers to get acquainted with.
                  Consequently, the beginning of the new period in Russian
                  history started with a lot of experimentation, comparative
                  work, and research in the conservation field. Specialists
                  returned to the international conservation community,
                  attending conferences and scientific seminars and learning
                  more about the work of their foreign colleagues. At this time
                  a lot of tests were also established, including those on
                  materials for structural conservation of canvases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  GOSNIIR conducted comparative research on three acrylic
                  dispersions: Lascaux 498&nbsp;HV (Lascaux Colours &amp; Restauro)
                  was compared to two adhesives originally produced in Russia
                  for coated paper and textile manufacturing. The first has the
                  trade name ABV1B and is a copolymer of butyl acrylate,
                  methacrylic acid, and vinyl acetate. The second has the trade
                  name AK-243 and is a copolymer of ethyl acrylate, methacrylic
                  acid, vinyl acetate, and acrylonitrile. Both have a working
                  concentration of up to 50% ([[Fedoseeva et al. 2016|, 98–99}
                  no perms doc +}). All three dispersions meet the general
                  requirements for a strip-lining adhesive: to not penetrate
                  deeply into the threads of the canvas, not cause shrinkage of
                  the canvas, have a high adhesive capacity, and form a film
                  with elasticity that persists over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Results of the comparative analysis showed that the AK-243 and
                  ABV-1B dispersions are superior to the Lascaux adhesive on a
                  number of indicators; in particular, they penetrate less into
                  the threads of the canvas and do not cause shrinkage
                  ([[Fedoseeva, Malachevskaya, and Yashkina 1997]]).
                  Nevertheless, today the most popular adhesives for
                  strip-lining are Beva products (Beva&nbsp;371 Film or Beva D-8
                  Dispersion) and Lascaux 498&nbsp;HV ([[Romanova 2019]]). This
                  popularity is despite the fact that both AK-243 and ABV-1B are
                  still produced in Russia: manufacturers sell them only in
                  industrial-scale volumes and retailers are not interested in
                  organizing packaging the products in smaller sizes,
                  conservators have problems obtaining them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following international trends, in the 1990s, the Russian
                  conservation community started to familiarize itself with
                  synthetic materials for lining and to compare them with
                  traditional techniques ([[Fedoseeva 1998]]). There were also
                  some intentions to develop or adapt Russian synthetic polymers
                  for the lining process.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  In the end, an understanding that the most common sturgeon
                  glue lining has obvious drawbacks and is not suitable for all
                  artworks led to adopting a method for treating oil paintings
                  that has been well known for lining textiles since the 1970s,
                  when it was introduced at the Pranas Gudynas Centre for
                  Restoration in Lithuania.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The method employs an acrylic adhesive with the trade name
                  A-45-K, which is a copolymer of vinyl acetate, butyl acrylate,
                  and acrylic acid in ethyl acetate ({Emelyanov 2004}). In a
                  form of either a dispersion or acetone solution, it can be
                  brushed or sprayed on a lining cloth and later activated by
                  temperature ([[Semechkina 1993|, 125]]). Its properties are in
                  many ways similar to Plextol and Lascaux adhesives, but
                  choosing a local manufacturer was preferred in the 1970s, not
                  only to support the country’s economy but also because this
                  particular material was well-known and tested. A-45-K has not
                  become very popular for standard lining procedures for
                  canvases, but it showed good results in a few specific case
                  studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One example is the lining support of the eighteenth century
                  painting
                  <em>Conclusions of Field Marshall General Count B.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Minikh on
                    the Seizure of Ochakov</em>” ([<strong>figs. 6.1a and b</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/6-Yurovetsksya/fig-6-1))
                  ([[Iurovetskaia et al. 2019]]). Silk was used as a support
                  ([<strong>fig. 6.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/6-Yurovetsksya/fig-6-2)),
                  and the image layer combined oil, gold paint, and ink.
                  Adhesive A-45-K dissolved in acetone was sprayed on the
                  surface of the lining cloth ([<strong>fig. 6.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/6-Yurovetsksya/fig-6-3))
                  and after matching with the original support was activated
                  locally by heat ([<strong>figs. 6.4a and b</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/6-Yurovetsksya/fig-6-4)).
                  Effective application of A-45-K for this art piece still has
                  not led to widespread adoption of this technique among
                  professional conservators because, since 2006, when this
                  method was first introduced for lining the Mikhail Vrubel
                  painting <em>Gwydon</em> on a sackcloth support, it has become
                  increasingly complicated to buy the material from the
                  manufacturers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nowadays, restoration professionals in Russia often face
                  difficulty accessing materials adapted for conservation
                  purposes in our country and thus turn to reliable professional
                  materials by internationally known suppliers. In this way, the
                  conservation field in Russia is experiencing globalization,
                  with all its challenges and opportunities, and mostly sticking
                  to materials and techniques that are used worldwide. This
                  certainly makes our work more comfortable, but it also
                  eliminates distinctions between different conservation schools
                  with their unique methods and approaches.

                <p>
                  In his essay “Three Days that Changed Conservation,” David
                  Bomford reflected upon the circumstances surrounding the 1974
                  Conference on Comparative Lining Techniques and its status as
                  an important inflection point in the history of paintings
                  conservation: “It was the beginning of a new precision, a new
                  refinement, and it heralded a new technical intelligence in
                  targeting conservation treatments …. Greenwich was when
                  conservation came of age” ([[Bomford 2017|, 1]]). What
                  followed was a proliferation of approaches to treatment,
                  coincident adoption of new materials, and a need for
                  supportive fundamental and practical research.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The past forty-five years have seen technical refinements of
                  traditional methods, changes in the ways that conservators
                  communicate the nuances of structural treatment, engineering
                  of new purpose-built equipment for lining and alternatives to
                  lining, development of new approaches to lining, changes in
                  material formulations, adoption of sophisticated research
                  instrumentation, and increased international exchange of
                  information. While the advances have been numerous, the
                  challenges ahead are equally numerous and increasingly
                  formidable. This paper attempts to anticipate some of these
                  significant challenges and to provide a framework for
                  sustainable collaborative efforts to address future
                  difficulties.

                  The Current State of Terminology
                </h2>
                <p>
                  One of the efforts of the Greenwich conference proceedings was
                  the production of a handbook of terms used in the lining of
                  paintings—an attempt to define about three hundred terms so
                  that conservators from different countries and different
                  lining traditions and philosophies could communicate
                  effectively. This handbook was reproduced for subsequent
                  conferences and seminars, and it is included as a glossary in
                  the volume republished nearly 20 years ago ([[Villers
                  2003b]]). Despite the handbook’s status as a key resource in
                  the training of paintings conservators, and despite
                  international efforts to standardize terminology in the realm
                  of conservation of cultural heritage,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Cecil Krarup Andersen found in 2012 that the frequency of
                  deviations from terminology established in the Greenwich
                  Handbook increased with the passage of time in
                  English-language publications included in AATA ([[Andersen
                  2012]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The reasons behind these deviations are many. Given the
                  adoption of English as a lingua franca in conservation
                  literature, Andersen and others have noted the persistence of
                  English cognates in different lining traditions, resulting in
                  a collection of terms having essentially the same meaning:
                  lining, relining, doubling, and redoubling, for example.
                  Additionally, the introduction of new materials and innovative
                  approaches to treatment have given rise to adjustments to
                  classical terminology and the creation of new terms and
                  variants. Further confusion can result from techniques falling
                  under umbrella terms while being fundamentally different
                  procedures. For example, the thread-by-thread tear-mending
                  techniques first described by Winfried Heiber ([[Heiber
                  2003]]), and adapted by Petra Demuth and others, have
                  influenced the development of various bridging and reweaving
                  techniques for the stabilization and reestablishment of
                  tension in torn supports. Of the two, reweaving may be more
                  consistent with Heiber’s approach, yet both approaches may be
                  described as thread-by-thread tear mending or a modified
                  Heiber technique.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One might suggest that our terminology has sprawled due to the
                  lack of an explicit, unified imperative for international
                  consistency. Inconsistent terminology may be cause for alarm;
                  however, this “problem” is a natural consequence of parallel
                  research and practical innovation that leverages the material
                  traditions of varied regional practice. The expansion of our
                  shared lexicon and authors’ apparent agency to redefine
                  accepted terminology suggests that the international community
                  has engaged in rapid adoption of new techniques and materials
                  to such a degree that flexibility has been valued over rigid
                  language structures. To stifle experimental creativity by
                  imposing specific linguistic constraints could strip some of
                  the nuance from technical descriptions of practical
                  applications—particularly if those communications originate
                  from outside of English-speaking traditions. If the trajectory
                  of modern structural treatment is founded upon flexible
                  decision-making trees—an intentional move away from
                  prescriptive treatment—then it is imperative that paintings
                  conservators aim to embrace and understand the breadth of
                  traditions and techniques that exist internationally.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  In the current global environment, with its mounting
                  uncertainties due to climate change, political unrest, and
                  public health crises, and given the limited resources
                  allocated to the conservation of cultural heritage,
                  conservators must seek out opportunities to create efficient
                  practices. Shared knowledge, sustained longitudinal research,
                  and the ability to anticipate future material challenges will
                  have increased value in the decades ahead. Our best shot for
                  rising to these demands is through international
                  collaboration.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Of course, conservators must be able to communicate the
                  technical aspects of their work with precision and clarity,
                  and we must be willing to make nuanced adjustments to our
                  terminology with the accumulation of scientific,
                  philosophical, and practical information—shifting away from
                  idealistic “reversibility” in favor of the practical
                  “retreatability,” and gaining a more granular understanding of
                  increased transparency of oil paint films ([[Van Loon 2008]])
                  due to deterioration processes and through structural
                  intervention ([[Froment 2019]]), for example. Although the
                  adoption of English as the operating language imposes some
                  structure for a shared terminology, doing so also inhibits the
                  participation and investment of experts globally, and we risk
                  the erosion of nuance with each translation. If conservators
                  embrace international collaboration as a benchmark of
                  sustainable practice,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  we will increase the probability of discovering new insights
                  and relationships among differing international (and
                  intergenerational) practices.

                  This initiative would be a significant undertaking building
                  upon and necessarily superseding efforts such as the Greenwich
                  conference handbook of terms and the LMCR project spearheaded
                  by the Associazone Giovanni Secco Suardo;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  however, the benefits and potential efficiencies should be
                  apparent to the reader, and the greater understanding and
                  respect for traditions and innovations outside of the English
                  language would help to build a more inclusive international
                  community.

                  While parallels to medical fields might suggest that
                  conservators should adopt a standardized lexicon, so much of
                  the variation in our work is influenced by geography—the
                  materials and techniques employed by the artist, the
                  environmental conditions to which the painting has been
                  subjected, and historical regional restoration practices—that
                  a monolithic definition of best practice is neither reasonable
                  nor sustainable. Rather, adopting a multilingual,
                  multiregional approach to terminology would ensure that our
                  common knowledge does not suffer an erosion of empirical
                  nuance.

                  Our terminology is only as good as our ability to fully
                  understand the material demands of a treatment, and our
                  ability to execute effective treatments depends on accurate
                  heuristics and decision-making as well as appropriate use of
                  purpose-built equipment. Each of these parameters is developed
                  and delineated through fundamental and practical research. Our
                  understanding of material properties and environmental
                  response, the development of technologies and equipment in
                  support of treatment refinements, and the evaluation of
                  treatment procedures all require collaboration between
                  conservators and scientists. Scientists ensure that research
                  methodologies are sound, and that the interpretation of data
                  holds scientific merit, and conservators ultimately decide how
                  applicable the scientific research is to their daily practice,
                  wherein conservators sort materials and techniques
                  qualitatively (e.g., “weak” versus “strong” and “sympathetic”
                  versus “invasive,” for example) for specific use cases.

                  Expanding Publication of “Ordinary” Treatments
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Research only gets us so far toward understanding structural
                  treatment. Ultimately, hands-on experimentation, practical
                  treatment, and object-level study are supported by fundamental
                  and practical research. A conservator’s ability to recalibrate
                  their heuristic understanding of treatment options relies upon
                  an accumulation of data: experiential, anecdotal, and peer
                  reviewed. Unfortunately for everyday practice, the
                  conservation treatment literature is overwhelmingly geared
                  toward the extraordinary: iconic paintings, material
                  curiosities, and technical challenges. It can be difficult for
                  a conservator to know when a project or observation is
                  appropriate for or worthy of publication. Thoughts that this
                  treatment is not interesting enough for publication or this
                  painting is not important enough for publication are
                  counterproductive in the long term, resulting in collective
                  blind spots in the conservation literature.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A more sustainable and collaborative approach to this problem
                  would be to encourage the publication of seemingly routine
                  data about methods of manufacture and treatment procedures,
                  either making room within established scholarly spaces or
                  supporting new publication venues devoted to communications of
                  “routine” treatments. This is an uncomfortable thought,
                  however, for some practitioners and institutions, especially
                  in the realm of conservation of modern and contemporary
                  materials, wherein confidentiality is often key to the
                  conservator-client (and conservator-client-dealer-foundation)
                  relationship. We cannot expect colleagues to jeopardize their
                  working relationships, but we should not feel satisfied by a
                  discourse illustrated with redacted images and presentation
                  slides with do-not-tweet warnings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A reasonable compromise that would provide some degree of
                  confidentiality while enabling the aggregation of treatment
                  data would be to encourage periodic publication of treatments
                  within an institution or private practice over the course of
                  five to ten years. These summaries would overcome the
                  misconception that individual treatments may not be worthy of
                  publication, while tracking adoption and use of techniques and
                  materials. Moreover, such publications would provide
                  opportunities to discuss successes and shortcomings of
                  treatments both ordinary and extraordinary. Lastly, this
                  initiative would generate opportunities for conservators to
                  think critically about their work and how their philosophies
                  evolve over time. In sum, a critical mass of such publications
                  would provide enough information to allow the field to better
                  describe use boundaries among different structural treatment
                  options in different exhibition and storage environments. Of
                  course, this proposal hinges upon the support of existing
                  editorial boards and/or the foundation of one or more new
                  journals.

                  Increasing Practitioners’ Command of Diverse Treatment
                  Methodologies
                </h3>
                <p>
                  An outgrowth of the production of a new international
                  terminology and broader publication of practical treatment
                  information (and indeed, of the Conserving Canvas initiative)
                  should be the increase of conservators’ capacity for
                  understanding and commanding multiple approaches for
                  structural treatment. The past few decades have seen a
                  proliferation of new cleaning technologies aimed at greater
                  specificity, efficacy ([[Ormsby et al. 2010]]), control
                  ([[Tauber et al. 2018]]), and increased safety to the
                  practitioner.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  Yet the same demand for specificity in structural treatment is
                  seemingly lacking; a paintings conservator might be expected
                  to utilize only a few structural treatment procedures each for
                  humidification, consolidation, tear mending, and lining. One
                  goal of modern structural treatment should be to work toward
                  the understanding of and proficiency in multiple techniques to
                  service different needs and to achieve differing effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ways in which we describe treatment parameters can be
                  expanded by considering varied approaches. For instance, a
                  more nuanced understanding of treatment possibilities makes it
                  possible to better define one’s intent with a treatment:
                  whether or not adhesive methods are required, and if they are,
                  where within the structure of the painting one aims to
                  localize the adhesive bond, and what is intended for the
                  method of retreatability. From there, the choice of materials
                  and the ability to control the conditions imposed upon the
                  painting during treatment determines (in part) the success at
                  realizing the intent of the treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An individual conservator, a training program, and a museum
                  might have their own proficiencies when it comes to structural
                  treatment; by relying upon each other, we are able to fill in
                  knowledge gaps and develop formal and informal advisory groups
                  to guide individual treatments and long-term practical
                  advancement. An ancillary benefit of gaining proficiencies
                  across several different types of structural treatment is an
                  increased ability to adapt when working in nonideal conditions
                  or when material formulations change.

                  Material Sustainability and Probable Impacts on Structural
                  Treatment
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In recent years, sustainability has transformed from a
                  buzzword to an urgent concern. Increased focus has been placed
                  upon material sourcing, with specific attention paid to
                  materials refined from petroleum and other nonrenewable
                  resources. Other key factors in material sustainability are
                  environmental impact (how a material influences the stability
                  of various biomes) and human health and safety (how chronic
                  and acute exposures affect organ function and how materials
                  metabolize and bioaccumulate within the body). One consequence
                  of pursuing sustainable materials and practices is the
                  greening of our chemistry, either by choice or through
                  governmental regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of the various regulatory frameworks worldwide, the European
                  Union’s Regulation, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction
                  of Chemicals (REACH) is a good predictor of materials to which
                  conservators might lose access in the near future.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  Under REACH is a list of substances of very high concern
                  (SVHC): a register of chemicals that are deemed problematic
                  and have been proposed for restricted use or other
                  regulations. Suppliers and manufacturers can receive
                  authorizations to formulate substances containing restricted
                  materials; however, if a manufacturer were to find a
                  substitute chemical that performs similarly while being
                  unrestricted, there is a strong likelihood that the
                  formulation of the substance will change. For the purposes of
                  structural treatment, conservators need to be aware of the
                  current formulations of our common materials and the chemical
                  similarities between components of conservation materials and
                  those on the SVHC list.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the number of changes to paintings conservation
                  practice resulting from governmental regulations should be
                  low, there are examples of anticipated changes that are of
                  significant concern. Phthalates feature in general on the SVHC
                  list,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  mostly because of the risk of oral exposure due to the
                  presence of phthalate plasticizers in children’s toys and in
                  plastic bottles. The most common occurrence of phthalates in
                  paintings conservation is in the formulation of Beva 371 and
                  Beva 371b, both of which include Cellolyn 21, a phthalate
                  ester of rosin acids.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  Replacing Cellolyn 21 in the formulation of Beva products will
                  likely change the tacking, setting, and melting temperatures
                  of the adhesive.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  Phenol ethoxylates, a class of nonionic surfactants, are under
                  increasing scrutiny.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  Nonylphenol ethoxylates, for example, are restricted materials
                  under REACH, but they have been used in the past in
                  formulations of acrylic dispersions. It is likely that the
                  surfactant components of acrylic dispersions will undergo a
                  series of substitutions, possibly resulting in different
                  working properties and changes to the pH of acrylic dispersion
                  formulations. Lastly, some of our common solvents have been
                  deemed problematic, including many aromatic solvents. Any
                  restrictions placed upon these solvents could have
                  implications for reversibility of certain treatments and for
                  the feasibility of some adhesive formulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to material substitutions due to governmental
                  regulations, conservation materials extracted from threatened
                  or endangered species may not be available in the future.
                  Examples of these species include many types of sturgeon, from
                  which protein glues can be extracted, and some algae species
                  responsible for the production of agar-agar and agarose.
                  Conservators need to be aware of the possibility of
                  formulation changes. Not only do we have a moral obligation to
                  comply with regulations, but we also have an ethical
                  obligation to anticipate material changes and the impact such
                  changes may have on retreatability of current treatments.
                  Luckily, being prepared for changes in the name of
                  sustainability can be accomplished by attempting to address
                  all of the challenges highlighted above.

                <p>
                  Our ever-evolving understanding of the structural treatment of
                  paintings on fabric supports is built upon nuance and
                  experience expressed first in native tongues and shared across
                  cultures thereafter. If conservators and scientists can work
                  together to communicate effectively and efficiently, to
                  explore the limits of our current techniques, to respect the
                  expertise inherent in regional traditions, and to encourage
                  fundamental and practical research within our international
                  conservation framework, we will have followed sustainable and
                  adaptable trajectories for progress. These collaborative
                  efforts will be most effective if we avoid impulses toward
                  secrecy and proprietarianism, embrace communications detailing
                  treatments and studies, both routine and extraordinary—whether
                  they be successes or failures—and we plan ahead for conditions
                  where problematic or scarce materials need to be replaced.
                  Thus, multilingual and multiregional inclusiveness will
                  provide the field with a plurality of best practices to adopt,
                  adapt, and evolve into the future.

                  The previous conservation treatments of van Dyck’s
                  <em>Equestrian Portrait of Charles I</em> present a history of
                  lining. Having been lined with a glue-paste adhesive twice in
                  the late nineteenth century, the painting was relined with a
                  wax-resin adhesive in 1952, and in the recent treatment was
                  relined with Lascaux 375, an equivalent heat-seal adhesive to
                  Beva 371. This article describes the recent treatment,
                  starting with the removal of the wax-resin lining, and
                  includes the repairs to the original canvas and the relining,
                  which was carried out in two separate stages on a heated
                  low-pressure table while the painting was held in a vacuum
                  envelope.

                <p>
                  The <em>Equestrian Portrait of Charles I</em> by Anthony van
                  Dyck (NG 1172), painted around 1637–38, monumental in scale
                  (368 x 292.5 cm), imposingly depicts the king as the divinely
                  chosen ruler of Great Britain, celebrating the union between
                  England and Scotland following the accession of Charles’s
                  father, James I, to the throne in 1603 ([<strong>fig. 8.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-1)).
                  Van Dyck’s choice of an equestrian portrait not only
                  demonstrates the king’s horsemanship but is also deliberately
                  reminiscent of equestrian statues in Ancient Rome that were
                  intended as assertions of temporal power. It was painted
                  toward the end of a period of relative prosperity in England
                  and set in a tranquil English landscape, shortly before the
                  country was plunged into a bloody civil war in which Charles
                  lost his throne—and his head when he was executed on January
                  30, 1649. The depiction of this poignant moment in English
                  history has ensured its popularity with visitors to the
                  National Gallery and its importance within the collection.
                  Only rarely has it been taken off display, and it normally
                  hangs in Room 31, where it creates an imposing impression and
                  forms a vista to draw the public into the Gallery as they
                  enter through the Central Hall.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Van Dyck painted the portrait on a twill weave canvas with a
                  black ticking pattern, which has a central horizontal join
                  ([<strong>fig. 8.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-2));
                  it bears Charles I’s original cipher at the center of the
                  reverse. This type of canvas, commonly used for domestic
                  upholstery, was probably chosen for its strength and toughness
                  and because it could be obtained in large widths, making it an
                  attractive choice of material for large paintings. The canvas
                  was prepared with a red-brown ground followed by a thick,
                  oil-based gray priming.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The decision to fully retreat the picture in 2018 was based on
                  the fact that the lining canvas was detaching from the
                  original and the previously applied varnish and retouchings
                  had discolored significantly. All lining activity at the
                  National Gallery since the late 1970s has entailed the
                  relining of paintings—that is, the replacement of an old and
                  degraded lining with a new one. On the occasions when
                  previously unlined pictures have required structural
                  attention, less invasive forms of treatment than lining have
                  been selected. In the case of the van Dyck, the recent
                  relining was a nonimpregnating, nap-bond treatment carried out
                  with an equivalent of Beva 371, Lascaux Heat-Seal Adhesive
                  375, using a vacuum-envelope technique.

                  Early History and Ownership
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The painting’s checkered early history has affected its
                  condition. In 1650, shortly after Charles I’s execution,
                  Cromwell sold the painting to Sir Balthazar Gerbier, who
                  resold it to Gisbert van Ceulen in Antwerp, from where it was
                  sold yet again to Duke Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of
                  Bavaria and governor of the Spanish Netherlands ([[Martin
                  1972|, 44]]). In 1698, the painting was looted from Munich by
                  Emperor Joseph I, who gifted the picture to the first Duke of
                  Marlborough in 1706. From then, it remained in the UK at
                  Blenheim Palace until the National Gallery acquired it in 1885
                  for the sum of £17,500. Throughout all these changes in
                  ownership the painting would have been rolled up and
                  transported by horse and cart or by ship. The raised,
                  horizontal craquelure in the picture is indicative of the
                  painting having been rolled, as are the large number of splits
                  and losses at the sides ([<strong>fig. 8.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-3)).
                  A series of vertical of losses at the right edge also suggest
                  that the rolled canvas was tied too tightly, crushing the
                  paint in these areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since the painting entered the National Gallery’s collection
                  it has rarely travelled. During World War I the picture was
                  evacuated to Overstone Park, outside of Northampton. During
                  the Second World War, it went first to Penrhyn Castle, and
                  then in 1941 to the Manod slate mine in Wales. On both of
                  these latter occasions it was transported upright on its
                  stretcher in a large wooden case strapped to the back of a
                  lorry. On its journey to Manod the truck had to pass through a
                  tunnel that was not tall enough to accommodate the height of
                  the case. This had been anticipated, and the road had been dug
                  up beforehand to make extra height, but even so there was
                  insufficient headroom for the truck to pass through, and the
                  truck’s tires had to be deflated ([[Clark 1977|, 6]]; [[Davies
                  and Rawlins 1946|, 13]]). On its return trip to the Gallery in
                  June 1945 the painting travelled mostly by train. More
                  recently, in January 2018, the painting was lent to the Royal
                  Academy’s exhibition <em>Charles I: King and Collector</em>,
                  and it again remained on its stretcher for the short journey
                  across London.

                  Early Relining Treatments
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Before the recent treatment, which began with a cleaning in
                  June 2018, the painting had already been lined at least four
                  times; as a result, it presents a potted history of lining at
                  the Gallery. It was acquired already lined, almost certainly
                  with a glue-paste adhesive, and relined immediately after
                  acquisition with glue-paste by William Morrill, a private
                  liner who regularly undertook work for the Gallery. Morrill
                  was the second generation of a dynasty of liners renowned for
                  their tough, durable linings—which, by today’s standards,
                  often produced overly flat picture surfaces. In the case of
                  the <em>Equestrian Portrait,</em> this was achieved at the
                  expense of squashing the impasto in the picture, leaving
                  moated depressions around these areas.

                  It is worth emphasizing the durability of the Morrill family’s
                  linings, a number of which still remain on National Gallery
                  paintings, and they have stayed in a stable condition despite
                  now being around 170 years old. In 1889, however, four years
                  after his initial lining, Morrill was asked to reline the
                  painting again, because it was considered that the central
                  join protruded too much. This time he did another paste
                  relining but using two lining canvases. However, this lining
                  created further damage. Morrill cut away all the excess canvas
                  at the back of the join, and completely removed the stitching
                  in the central section as well but left the stitching intact
                  at the ends of the join. During the relining, the two original
                  pieces of canvas shrank apart, leaving a 4–5&nbsp;mm gap across the
                  center of the join, and at the points where the stitching
                  remained, the painting bulged away from the lining canvas,
                  forming large air pockets. The bulge at the left was ironed
                  flat, leaving a slight depression, but ironing the one at the
                  right created a raised crease in the original canvas and a
                  50-cm-long vertical line of paint loss. A similar crease was
                  made in the center of the bottom edge. Additionally, during
                  the lining removals that Morrill undertook, fragments of old
                  glue became trapped underneath the picture, causing holes and
                  indentations in the picture surface, mostly around the edges.

                <p>
                  By 1952, Morrill’s lining canvases had embrittled, tearing at
                  the turnover edges, and the surface of the painting had become
                  undulated. By this time the Gallery no longer used private
                  restorers, having established a conservation department in the
                  late 1940s. Arthur Lucas, who later became the Gallery’s chief
                  restorer, decided to remove Morrill’s double lining using a
                  mixture of water and ethanol to soften the glue layers, and to
                  then reline the painting with a single piece of linen adhered
                  with a wax-resin mixture (58% plain beeswax, 40% dammar resin,
                  2% stand oil) using heated hand irons. There was a vogue for
                  wax lining at the Gallery from shortly after the war until the
                  late 1970s, when it was supplanted by Beva 371. Lucas’s
                  decision to reline the picture may have been considered
                  legitimate at the time, but nowadays it might be considered
                  more appropriate to flatten the undulations and repair the
                  edges of the lining by adding a strip lining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lucas’s lining also had its problems. The water and ethanol
                  used to remove Morrill’s lining made the original canvas
                  buckle and undulate, and these problems were not addressed
                  with any flattening treatments before relining. The relining
                  was initially carried out with the painting face down, and the
                  lining canvas, stretched onto a loom and prepared with the
                  wax-resin, was placed on top of it—a standard procedure at the
                  time. The lining canvas was ironed from the reverse, lightly
                  tacking the painting to the lining, which was then turned face
                  up so that the ironing could continue over the facing tissue
                  covering the front of the picture. The temperature of the
                  irons was reduced, and the wax adhesive did not get hot enough
                  to form an even layer nor form a good bond between the two
                  canvases. The result was that the rippled undulations caused
                  during the delining remained and, due to the considerably
                  uneven distribution of wax, more pronounced lumps and bumps
                  were created in the picture surface ([<strong>fig. 8.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-4)).
                  By 2018, the painting was detaching from the lining,
                  particularly at the edges.

                  After cleaning, a template was made of the damages and
                  distortions at the front by marking these areas onto thick
                  sheets of Melinex (polyester film), so that they could be
                  accurately located on the back of the picture during the later
                  stages of the treatment.

                <p>
                  The central join was then faced with Japanese tissue adhered
                  with a wheat starch and sturgeon glue adhesive, to provide
                  extra reinforcement to this area. This was followed by an
                  overall facing of Eltoline tissue and a beeswax and dammar
                  adhesive, diluted in mineral spirit and applied cold. The
                  intention was to enable the removal of the overall facing
                  without affecting the Japanese tissue, so that the join would
                  remain reinforced during a future rolling operation when the
                  painting needed to be turned face up after the removal of the
                  wax lining from the reverse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting was taken to the relining studio and placed face
                  down on a large table covered with silicon-coated Melinex. The
                  stretcher was removed and the lining canvas peeled away in
                  strips—a relatively easy task given that the lining canvas had
                  already become detached in parts and the adhesive had become
                  weak and brittle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The bulk of the wax resin, particularly the thicker areas—up
                  to 7 or 8&nbsp;mm thick—were scraped from the back of the original
                  using sharpened metal strips, leaving a thin film of the wax
                  resin, which was then removed with scalpels (see [<strong>fig. 8.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-2)).
                  A certain amount of the wax-resin adhesive remained
                  impregnated within the original canvas, but no attempt was
                  made to extract this using solvents as the adhesive had not
                  darkened the thick oil-based red ground and gray priming
                  layers. Throughout the treatment, the center of the painting
                  was reached by kneeling on large cushioned pads.

                  Once the old lining adhesive had been removed, the repairs to
                  the canvas were carried out. The splits at the sides of the
                  canvas were repaired with Evo-Stik Resin ‘W,’ an aqueous PVA
                  adhesive. Many of the splits, as well as losses at the edges
                  and small holes in the center of the picture, required inserts
                  of new, oil-primed linen canvas adhered with the same PVA
                  adhesive and then heated with a hot spatula and placed under
                  weights until dry (see [<strong>fig. 8.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-3)).

                <p>
                  The old, hard oil-based filling material used across the join
                  was generally well adhered, and so was left in place apart
                  from small, localized sections that had cracked and needed
                  replacing with inserts of new canvas. The join was reinforced
                  at the back with a 5-cm-wide strip of Stabiltex, a thin,
                  gauze-like polyester, that was preimpregnated with Lascaux 375
                  and attached using a hot spatula.

                  Abrasions to the back of the canvas caused by the previous
                  delinings had left the red ground visible in several areas at
                  the back, and these were consolidated with an aqueous acrylic
                  adhesive, Primal B60A. The hollow areas were then filled with
                  Mowiol GE 4-86, an aqueous polyvinyl alcohol binder, mixed
                  with chalk and tinted with pigments to match the canvas color.

                <p>
                  Many of the broader undulations in the canvas had disappeared
                  with the removal of the wax resin, but some remained,
                  particularly in the central area of the picture. The entire
                  painting was given a flattening treatment by locally
                  moistening the back of the canvas and covering it with boards
                  and weights while the areas dried overnight. This was done
                  section by section, starting from the center and working out
                  toward the edges. The Melinex template made at the outset
                  proved useful in locating specific areas of distortion, such
                  as the creased areas of canvas, which were also moistened and
                  massaged flat with a hot spatula. This proved reasonably
                  successful. Attempts were also made to flatten the numerous
                  small depressions in the picture surface caused by the
                  fragments of old glue pressed into the paint surface, as well
                  as the moated depressions around areas of impasto. These
                  treatments, however, had little effect.

                  Turning the Painting Face Up
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The painting was then ready to be turned face up. It had been
                  planned to do this by rolling the painting onto a large wooden
                  roller, and then unrolling it face up. However, given the
                  number of splits and the amount of damage at the sides, there
                  was a risk that rolling might cause further splitting. It was
                  therefore decided to adhere a temporary strip lining to the
                  facing at the front of the painting so that it could be
                  attached to its stretcher and then turned over. The strip
                  lining consisted of Saatifil PES 120/41, a thin polyester
                  adhered with Beva film heat-sealed with spatulas from the back
                  of the canvas. The stretcher, fitted with a polycarbonate
                  panel, was placed over the reverse of the picture, and the
                  strip lining was then stapled to the stretcher. A further
                  polycarbonate panel was slid under the front of the painting
                  and taped around the back of the stretcher. The painting,
                  stretched onto the stretcher and sandwiched between the two
                  polycarbonate sheets, was then lifted off the table and turned
                  face up onto the table, which was covered with freshly
                  siliconed Melinex.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The stretcher, the temporary strip lining, and facings were
                  all removed, and the losses in the painting were filled with
                  Mowiol and chalk, tinted to match the color of the original
                  gray priming. Following this, the painting was slid face up
                  onto the paneled stretcher, sandwiched between the
                  polycarbonate panels and Melinex, and be set aside while the
                  lining canvas and vacuum envelope were prepared.

                  Preparation of the Lining Canvas
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The lining canvas was prepared in an upper studio, as the
                  ceiling height in the lining studio was too low to accommodate
                  the wooden loom. The canvas—a single piece of linen with
                  double warp and weft yarns—was stretched onto an expandable
                  loom and wetted and prestretched three times to reduce the
                  canvas’s potential to shrink. The final wetting was done using
                  a deacidifying solution of magnesium bicarbonate in distilled
                  water with the intention of improving the longevity of the
                  lining and its future removability ([[Ryder 1986]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining canvas was sized with one part Lascaux 375 to three
                  parts mineral spirit, applied by brush. This not only provides
                  a uniform appearance at the back after lining but also aids
                  future reversibility by ensuring that more of the adhesive
                  remains stuck to the lining canvas, rather than to the back of
                  the original. Knots in the canvas were more readily removed
                  (with scalpels) after the sizing, and both sides of the canvas
                  were lightly sanded to give a smooth surface before a further
                  six coats of Lascaux 375, diluted 1:1 in mineral spirit, were
                  brushed onto one side of the canvas, with 24 hours drying time
                  allowed between each coat. This produced an even adhesive
                  layer that completely covered the canvas texture. The Lascaux
                  375 adhesive was not applied to the back of the painting, as
                  that would have produced an overly strong bond between the two
                  canvases and would impair the future removal of the lining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining canvas was then removed from the loom and rolled
                  onto a wooden roller, which was then taken to the lining
                  studio.

                  Construction of the Vacuum Envelope
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The vacuum envelope consisted of three lower sheets of thick
                  Melinex taped together with good-quality cellophane tape and
                  covered with overlapping sheets of silicon-coated Melinex,
                  which were taped at the edges to the thick Melinex ([<strong>fig. 8.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-5)).
                  The lining canvas was unrolled on top of the silicon-coated
                  Melinex with the adhesive layer face up, and the painting was
                  then positioned on top of the lining adhesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The same loom used in the preparation of the lining canvas was
                  positioned around the edges. The two long sides of the loom
                  were reinforced with wooden strips to prevent it from bowing
                  when the materials were stretched onto it, and holes were also
                  drilled through the short sides of the loom to accommodate the
                  tubing, which would later be connected to the two vacuum pumps
                  (see [<strong>fig. 8.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-5)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining canvas was first stretched onto the loom using
                  staples. The thick Melinex was also stapled to the loom
                  through a layer of tape to stop the Melinex from tearing, and
                  the staples were then covered with more tape to prevent air
                  leakage from within the envelope. The loom was lightly keyed
                  out at the corners so that the lining canvas and Melinex were
                  reasonably taut.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Strips of siliconed Melinex were taped around the edges of the
                  picture to stop the exposed areas of Lascaux 375 at the edges
                  of the painting from sticking to the top sheet of Melinex when
                  the adhesive was heated (see [<strong>fig. 8.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-5)).
                  This enabled the extraction of air from the central areas of
                  the picture and ensured that the entire painting could be
                  maintained under vacuum pressure throughout the lining

                  The air extraction system consisted of plastic plumbing pipes
                  drilled with holes at regular intervals and placed around the
                  edges of the picture and positioned on top of canvas webbing,
                  which further aided the extraction of air (see [<strong>fig. 8.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-5)).
                  The tubes connecting the pipework to the pumps were inserted
                  through a hole at each end of the loom and sealed in place
                  with silicon sealant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The top sheet of thinner Melinex, three sheets taped together,
                  was placed over the picture and taped to the top of the loom.
                  Previously, the wooden keys in the corners had been covered
                  with foam, and the edges of the loom rounded, in order to
                  avoid any sharp edges inside the envelope that might tear the
                  thin Melinex when under vacuum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Apart from its size and the air extraction system, the
                  construction of the envelope did not differ significantly from
                  the one presented by Gerry Hedley, Stephen Hackney, and Alan
                  Cummings at the Greenwich lining conference in 1974 ([[Hedley,
                  Hackney, and Cummings 2003]]). As they discovered, the
                  rigidity of the underlying thick Melinex is important in
                  preventing areas of impasto and surface distortions in the
                  painting from becoming “centered,” or partially pushed out to
                  the back of the lining when under vacuum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The pumps were not fitted with pressure gauges, and three
                  holes were drilled into the tubing at both ends to introduce
                  air leakage and thereby a reduction in pressure. This number
                  of holes was sufficient to allow the top layer of Melinex to
                  be comfortably pushed away from the paint surface.

                <p>
                  A large Willard Multi-purpose Low Pressure Table with a
                  surface area of 4&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp;m was used as the heat source. The
                  painting, being larger than the table, had to be heated in two
                  stages. Heating one half of the painting while the other
                  remains cool presents a problem, however: as the first section
                  is heated, the envelope and the materials inside it expand,
                  and can cause undulations between the heated and unheated
                  areas. Several means were used to obviate this:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The unheated section was warmed with domestic electric
                      blankets covered with foil to retain the heat. This
                      achieved a temperature of around 32°C on the picture
                      surface.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Four fan heaters were placed under the envelope pointing
                      upward and toward the edge of the lining table. This gave
                      a temperature of 38°C–40°C on the area of the painting
                      above the edge of the table.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      A centimeter-thick strip of Plastazote foam was taped
                      along the edge of the table to raise the envelope away
                      from the tabletop, to create an air gap that would reduce
                      the temperature at this point.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The envelope was moved onto the Willard table with the half
                  overhanging (not on the table) supported with adjustable props
                  ([<strong>fig. 8.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-6)).
                  For half an hour before the table was heated the vacuum pumps
                  were left running at full strength, with all the holes in the
                  tubing covered with tape. This ensured that any air trapped
                  between the lining canvas and painting was extracted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The holes in the tubing were then untaped and the pressure
                  reduced. The table’s heaters, set at 70°C, were switched on,
                  and at around 45°C, the temperature at which the adhesive
                  begins to soften, local areas of the painting were treated
                  with hot spatulas to improve small remaining surface
                  distortions. The temperature at the top surface was
                  independently monitored with thermocouples, and once these had
                  reached 68°C, the envelope was lifted off the table and the
                  second half was then positioned, with a slight overlap between
                  the two sections. The electric blankets were removed and the
                  foil placed over the already heated section.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the measures used to prevent undulations from
                  occurring, these did begin to appear, but they disappeared
                  instantly when the props at the unheated end were raised,
                  increasing the air gap between the envelope and the edge of
                  the table, and thereby reducing the temperature at this point.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once the entire painting had been heated, it was carried,
                  still under vacuum, to a large table, where it cooled within
                  fifteen minutes. The envelope was dismantled, and the
                  following day the painting was restretched onto its existing
                  stretcher using copper tacks, and the keys were secured.
                </p>
                <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  The treatment did much to improve the surface appearance of
                  the painting by removing the lumps and undulations created by
                  the 1952 wax relining and also provided a more durable support
                  for the picture than had been previously achieved. Although
                  improvements were made to the raised creases that were a
                  result of Morrill’s second relining, the flattened and moated
                  areas of impasto remained unchanged. After the relining had
                  been completed, the painting was retouched and revarnished
                  before being returned to display in Room 31 ([<strong>fig. 8.7</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-7)).

                  Mist lining was developed by Jos van Och at the Stichting
                  Restauratie Atelier Limburg (SRAL) in Maastricht, The
                  Netherlands, in the 1990s. It has since been used successfully
                  to line numerous paintings, large and small, of different
                  ages, conditions, and painting techniques. Pretreatments are
                  used to solve distinct problems, leaving the action of lining
                  solely to providing additional support. The mist-lining system
                  avoids the use of heat, moisture, and high pressure and thus
                  respects the integrity of the original structure and texture.
                  Mist lining provides an alternative, low-cost system to
                  traditional or other modern lining techniques. Careful
                  selection of lining support, the manner in which the lining
                  adhesive is applied, and the means to set the bond
                  differentiates this technique. The acrylic adhesive creates a
                  “bridge” between the two canvases without impregnation.
                  Choosing the right solvent for activation allows the acrylic
                  adhesive to bond well to a wide variety of previously treated
                  canvases, including wax-resin lined paintings. The bond has
                  good shear resistance, though its peel force is lower.
                  Delining of previously mist-lined canvases is therefore
                  facilitated, allowing mist-lined canvases to be delined
                  successfully, even over time.

                <p>
                  Lining canvas paintings has ever been a contentious action.
                  Many canvas paintings have been lined, and at times relined.
                  Age and condition have often not been prerequisites for
                  implementing linings, as for a time it was seen as a
                  preventative measure. Linings were intended to carry the load
                  that the original damaged support could no longer bear, as
                  well as solving a multitude of other structural issues,
                  including consolidation and improvement of cupping and planar
                  distortions. This often “one-stop” <span></span>process was
                  deemed long lasting, beneficial, and cost efficient. The type
                  of lining carried out tended to be dependent on the training
                  of the conservator-restorer, studio practice, and geographical
                  location. Time has shown that the life span of linings is
                  determinable, and the lining cycle continues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The “moratorium” on lining called for after 1974 Greenwich
                  conference on comparative lining techniques ([[Villers
                  2003b]]) never materialized, but the idea encouraged
                  conservators to think of other options for structural repair.
                  Full linings fell out of fashion, and strip-lining as well as
                  thread-by-thread tear mending became standard practice.
                  However, these options cannot be used for severely
                  structurally compromised canvas paintings—thus, full lining
                  continues to be necessary. The mist-lining process is still a
                  relatively new technique and not yet part of many
                  conservators’ toolkits. Familiarity with this process can
                  expand the contemporary conservator’s repertoire and provide
                  one of a few ethical solutions for structural support.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mist-lining process was invented and developed by Jos van
                  Och in the 1990s at the Stichting Restauratie Atelier Limburg
                  (SRAL) ([[Fife, van Och, and Harrison 2017]]; [[Seymour and
                  van Och 2005]];[[van Och and Hoppenbrouwers 2003]]). The term
                  <em>mist lining</em> was coined by SRAL in the early 2000s and
                  is now used to denote the technique, system, and process. The
                  mist-lining system has roots in developments in structural
                  treatments for lining canvases initially presented in the
                  1970s by Gustav Berger and Vishwa R. Mehra ([[Berger 1972a]];
                  [[Mehra 1975a]]; [[Mehra 1975b]]).

                  Mist lining is a noninvasive lining technique that involves
                  spraying minimal amounts of an acrylic dispersion resin onto
                  an auxiliary canvas before adhering that canvas to the reverse
                  of the original support, often without tension. This open
                  adhesive network is regenerated from the dry state,
                  eliminating moisture. Solvent vapors (or gentle heat) are used
                  to swell and tackify the adhesive.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Bonding occurs under light pressure when the adhesive is
                  activated. The system can be classified as a cold-lining
                  method and forms a nap bond. The lining adhesive remains
                  sandwiched between the two canvases with no impregnation of
                  either textiles or decorative layers, which aids reversibility
                  and negates any alteration of appearance.

                  Mist-Lining Methodology
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The origins of mist lining lie in the desire to find an
                  ethical replacement for more invasive lining techniques.
                  Conservators commit to following a code of ethics. These
                  emphasize that cultural heritage should be preserved for
                  future generations while respecting aesthetic, historic, and
                  intangible significances, as well as maintaining physical
                  integrity. Conservators should, thus, limit treatment to
                  necessary actions and strive to use compatible, non-altering
                  products, materials, and procedures. Treatments should not
                  interfere with future actions, examination, or analysis, and
                  should be reversible.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  The non-impregnating, easily reversible mist-lining system
                  complies with this ethos.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mist-lining process is not a stand-alone procedure and
                  must be considered in relation to other treatments that will
                  be carried out on the painting, either before or after lining.
                  The mist-lining methodology requires each problem to be
                  handled independently. Simply put, the issues presented by the
                  painting are analyzed and solutions to deal with each specific
                  situation are found and resolved independently of lining. The
                  lining action is, thus, kept separate from other required
                  treatments. This enables the process to be highly adaptable
                  and tailored to the individual case.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mist lining is typically carried out after any reduction of
                  planar distortions, overall treatment of the support,
                  consolidation of paint layers, individual mending and/or
                  strengthening of tears and holes, and removal of undesired
                  superficial layers. Deformations are first flattened by
                  prestretching the support and applying gentle and gradual
                  lateral tension, often combined with humidification.
                  Conversely, the mist-lining system will conform to any
                  preexisting out-of-plane deformations and thus can be used to
                  support (modern) canvas paintings devised with a more
                  three-dimensional nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consolidation of paint layers occurs as a separate step using
                  an appropriate adhesive. Removal of varnish layers and
                  overpaints is carried out prior to lining, though linings can
                  be effectuated with any nonoriginal coatings left intact.
                  Subsequent treatments often involve filling of paint losses,
                  retouching, and revarnishing. After lining, it is imperative
                  to consider fully the implications of the choice of solvent
                  for varnish application, or the use of heat to impress texture
                  in fills, as both solvent exposure and heat will affect the
                  lining adhesive. Some examples of pretreatments implemented
                  prior to mist lining are reported in the
                  <em>Mist-Lining Handbook</em> ([[Seymour and Strombek 2022]]).
                  Mist lining has been a successful choice for paintings that
                  have a past structural treatment legacy, whether lined with
                  glue-paste or wax-resin adhesives or both. Research has been
                  carried out showing that the sprayed acrylic adhesive adheres
                  well to canvases impregnated with wax resin ([[Contreras
                  2015]];[[Fischer 2002]]). This property enables the use of
                  heat on these thermo-sensitive structures to be avoided.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mist-lining process allows conservators to make the best
                  choice for the needs of the individual canvas painting, rather
                  than using a standardized technique to solve all issues. The
                  choice to use the mist-lining system, thus, comes at the
                  initial stage of the decision-making process—when considering
                  the treatment plan—although the commitment to using the system
                  can be altered, if necessary, as treatment progresses. The
                  order of treatments, therefore, needs to be fully considered
                  before the plan is confirmed. Our philosophy is to leave
                  options open as much as possible. Each step of the treatment
                  process is thought through, taking into account the
                  consequences for subsequent procedures and future behavior of
                  materials inherent in the system. For this reason, the
                  pretreatments described have great importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The decision to use this system comes with a caveat.
                  Expectations for results need to be tempered to accept
                  surfaces that are not as “flat as a board” or linings that are
                  not as “rigid as a plank.” This system does not produce the
                  same degree of surface finish and stiffness provided by
                  traditional linings. The natural drape of the canvas and
                  texture of paint layers will not be significantly altered
                  during lining. Any out-of-plane texture or impasto (including
                  cupping) that exists before lining will be maintained.
                  Consolidation problems are not resolved. The key, as
                  mentioned, is to treat these defects, as necessary, prior to
                  lining and to accept a certain natural “aged” look. (This may
                  mean taking a different approach to dealing with clients or
                  owners of paintings.) Nor does the system provide a stiff
                  lining support. Mist lining moves away from the idea that the
                  lining should carry all the stress within the laminate
                  structure. Instead, a mist lining provides “gentle” support to
                  the original materials, helping to mitigate dimensional
                  changes induced by climatic variations, but not preventing
                  them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These aspects of the system remain open to debate. No complete
                  scientific study comparing mist-lining results to those of
                  other lining systems has been carried out. This “new” approach
                  thus remains unprovable. However, numerous paintings, large
                  and small in scale and presenting a wide variety of past
                  treatments and conditions, have been lined with this system.
                  These have performed well over the last thirty years, so
                  perhaps the “proof is in the pudding.” Ongoing research aims
                  to provide further insight and answers to these issues
                  ([[Poulis, Seymour, and Yasmine 2020]]).

                  The Mist-Lining Process
                </h2>
                <p>
                  As mentioned, the mist-lining technique uses an acrylic
                  dispersion resin sprayed onto a prepared auxiliary textile
                  support. The result is an open network, rather than a
                  continuous layer of adhesive, which is allowed to dry on
                  application. After the lining canvas is placed in position,
                  the adhesive can be regenerated in-situ with solvent vapors.
                  Bonding occurs under low pressure without the use of heat or
                  moisture. The system effects a nap-bond with no impregnation
                  of the original textile or migration into the decorative
                  layers. This aids reversibility and avoids any change in
                  appearance. Delining can be effected by applying peel forces
                  (sometimes after solvent exposure) with little or no adhesive
                  remaining attached to the original textile.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The technique requires little equipment and is easy to set up
                  in the studio or on site. The low-pressure envelope can easily
                  be adapted to accommodate paintings of different sizes or
                  orientations (horizontal or vertical). Linings have been
                  effectively implemented on all sizes of paintings, including
                  large, oversized formats.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  Low-pressure tables can also be used, if a flatter lining
                  surface is needed. Furthermore, the adhesive mixture and
                  application process can be applied to effect strip-linings if
                  a full lining is not desirable.

                  Canvas Selection and Preparation
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Factors influencing the choice of lining canvas are the
                  ability to develop a nap, flexibility versus rigidity (drape),
                  responsiveness to humidity fluctuations, type of weave, and
                  thickness of the canvas. The response rate of warp and weft
                  threads to external conditions should be similar. Open-weave
                  fabrics are preferred, as less tension is required to decrimp
                  the fabric and to remount the painting. More importantly,
                  solvent vapors can diffuse more readily through open-weave
                  textiles so less solvent volume is required during activation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A wide range of textiles have been used by the SRAL team over
                  the years. Research into the mechanical properties of linen,
                  polyester, and mixed-fiber textiles have been considered
                  ([[Young and Jardine 2012]]). Choices are made on a
                  case-by-case basis. The canvas requires a spun-yarn textile
                  fabric, rather than a monofilament. Typically, open-weave
                  lightweight natural linen fabrics or a fire-resistant
                  lightweight spun-yarn polyester textile (Trevera CS) are used.
                  Many other fabric types have also been experimented with and
                  employed ([[Seymour and Strombek 2022]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining canvas may be tensioned prior to the application of
                  the sprayed adhesive. Natural linen textiles are decrimped,
                  only if the weave is dense, as the necessity is less for
                  open-weave textiles. The desired tension of the lining textile
                  is dependent on numerous factors. Firstly, the conservator
                  should determine if the lining process will take place under
                  tension or with either or both canvases in a free state. This
                  decision may depend on logistics (size), the condition of the
                  painting (first lining or relining), and future display
                  (environmental factors). Tension is thus considered a variable
                  in the process and cannot be quantified with a constant
                  number; however, the tension applied when preparing the lining
                  canvas should not be more than what will be required when
                  remounting the painting. The aim is not to overstretch the
                  adhesive when the lining is complete and to effect in an
                  undisturbed point-to-point bond between the two canvases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The size of the original support (including tacking margins)
                  is masked out on the lining canvas to ensure that the edges of
                  the lining fabric are not coated with adhesive. The surface of
                  the stretched lining canvas is prepared by enhancing the nap.
                  The yarn is disrupted to encourage fibers to protrude from the
                  surface. Nap fibers are fluffed up using sandpaper worked
                  gently in the same directions as the weave. The yarn should
                  not be broken. Care is taken not to disturb the napped surface
                  before spraying on the adhesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Interleaf textiles can be inserted as required to provide
                  enhanced local (to support tears or holes) or overall
                  stiffness. Nonwoven polyester or woven glass-fiber interleafs
                  (adhered prior to lining with either Plextol mixtures or Beva
                  371 Film) are typically used at SRAL. These will mitigate the
                  return of viscoelastic, out-of-plane deformations.

                  Currently, two methacrylic ester-acrylic ester copolymer
                  dispersions are mixed to obtain desired performance stiffness
                  and solubility characteristics. Plextol D&nbsp;540 and Dispersion
                  K&nbsp;360 (adjusted to pH 7) are used in a 30:70 ratio, but other
                  formulations are being further investigated due to the
                  discontinuation of Plextol D&nbsp;540. The manufacturer of Plextol
                  (Synthomer) has recommended as a substitute Plextol D&nbsp;512.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  This and other alternatives (Plextol D&nbsp;498 and Plextol B&nbsp;500)
                  are being tested to compare results at Delft University of
                  Technology (TU Delft) ([[Poulis, Seymour, and Mosleh
                  2020]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>

                <p>
                  A high-volume, low-pressure (HVLP) compressed-air spray gun is
                  used to spray the adhesive onto the canvas in a fine mist. The
                  spray mist only encapsulates the raised nap and does not
                  impregnate the lining fabric or create a continuous coating.
                  As only the nap is coated, the mechanical-physical properties
                  of the canvas are unchanged; it remains flexible and able to
                  conform to the drape and morphology dictated by the original
                  canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The optimum result is achieved when the adhesive is sprayed
                  from different angles in more than one layer. The aim is to
                  use as little adhesive as possible, something that is
                  currently judged through experience. The coating should remain
                  open and “fluffy” so as to allow the solvent vapors easy
                  access. A thinner layer of adhesive will react more quickly to
                  the solvent vapors and will need less pressure to create a
                  bond, but the bond achieved will be more resistant if the
                  adhesive layer is more substantial. It is, however, never the
                  aim to have a thick layer of adhesive! The ultimate thickness
                  of the sprayed adhesive layer is considered one of the key
                  variables of the system. We suggest those new to the system
                  practice these decision-making processes on mock-ups to gain
                  insight into such variables. [<strong>Figs. 9.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/9-Seymour/fig-9-1)

                  The sprayed adhesive is allowed to dry before lining occurs.
                  The two canvases are brought together before a subsequent bond
                  is effected within a low-pressure envelope. The original
                  canvas is carefully positioned on the lining canvas in contact
                  with the sprayed area. Smaller paintings can be lined face up
                  with the lining canvas loomed or untensioned, while larger
                  paintings are typically lined without being tensioned and face
                  down. In the latter case, the lining canvas is often rolled
                  into position over the exposed reverse of the original. It is
                  imperative that placement is carried out carefully and
                  precisely, so as not to flatten the fluffed, open network of
                  the adhesive and to ensure that the weave of the lining canvas
                  aligns with that of the original. Dragging the original over
                  the sprayed adhesive surface will deform the adhesive surface
                  and compress it into a continuous coating.

                  The Low-Pressure Envelope
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The low-pressure envelope consists of two differing
                  thicknesses of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic
                  sheeting and a ring of perforated pipes connected to a
                  centrifugal fan (or vacuum cleaner) ([<strong>fig. 9.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/9-Seymour/fig-9-3)).
                  Both plastic sheets should be solvent (and heat) resistant.
                  The plastic sheeting is typically sourced at local building
                  merchants. The thicker plastic sheet can be stretched to a
                  working frame that is larger than the lining canvas or taped
                  to a flat surface such as a table or floor. The thinner,
                  unstretched plastic sheet should be flexible enough to
                  accommodate surface topography (e.g., impasto, cupping). In
                  some cases, the setup can be reversed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The design of the low-pressure envelope is another key
                  variable of this adaptive system. Varying the thickness and
                  tension of the plastic sheeting will modify the pressure
                  exerted. The flexibility of the plastic sheeting allows an
                  even pressure to be applied over the whole surface area as the
                  plastic conforms to the topography of the structure within the
                  low-pressure envelope. A stiffer sheet of plastic (such as
                  Melinex) would exert pressure on high points and the force
                  exerted would be imposed on a smaller area. Using a too-stiff
                  membrane could potentially cause moating or even flatten
                  impastos; it could also push out-of-plane structures, such as
                  seams, forward. Slight deformations in the canvas can,
                  however, be manipulated, but the system does not exert
                  sufficient pressure to push severe deformations into plane.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Air is extracted from the low-pressure envelope using a ring
                  of perforated pipes (diameter about 2 cm). We typically use
                  PVC pipes intended to house electrical wires in walls, which
                  are sourced from local building merchants. Other improvised
                  versions could be utilized, such as garden hosepipes or
                  washing machine hose. The tubes should not deform when air is
                  extracted. Lengths of up to 3 meters can be bought and
                  modified to the desired size. Connection pieces make it
                  possible to extend beyond this dimension and connect at the
                  corners. The ring should be a good 20–30 centimeters wider
                  than the (loomed) lining canvas. Both plastic sheets used for
                  the envelope should be larger than the ring. Holes are drilled
                  into one side of the pipes at regular intervals. When
                  assembled, all corners and joints are taped together to ensure
                  the ring maintains its shape and does not disconnect during
                  lining. A T connector is used to attach the ring to the
                  centrifugal fan. When placed in the envelope, the pipes are
                  covered with a textile “sock” to ensure that the plastic
                  sheeting is not drawn into the holes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Air is extracted from the center of the envelope by including
                  a piece of cloth slightly larger than the ring system. We call
                  this a “breather.” It is typically placed on top of the
                  stiffer membrane. Note that there should also be soft material
                  placed under the envelope, outside the system, to ensure the
                  envelope is floating and that, if punctured, it will not be
                  sucked down to the flat surface, which would induce excess
                  pressure during lining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the centrifugal fan is turned on, air is extracted from
                  between the two plastic membranes evenly. Sharp edges (e.g.,
                  working loom members) should be padded with cloth coverings.
                  These also aid in the extraction of air from the center of the
                  envelope to the ring system. Thin nonwoven fabrics can also be
                  placed over the paint surface if desired; however, these stop
                  the upper plastic membrane from following the morphology of
                  the surface and may diminish the bond achieved. The exact
                  conformation to the surfaces (upper paint and lower textile)
                  by the plastic sheets permits a point-to-point bonding at a
                  low, even pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the low-pressure envelope is used in the lining
                  process it can also be used for a variety of other
                  conservation treatments. Further information on the materials
                  used is provided in the
                  <em>Mist-Lining Handbook</em> ([[Seymour and Strombek 2022]]).
                  We advise some experimentation prior to determining the setup
                  for the low-pressure envelope.
                </p>
                <h3 id="bond-formation" tabindex="-1">Bond Formation</h3>
                <p>
                  As opposed to a continuous coating, when dried, the open
                  adhesive network can effect a light bond with a very small
                  amount of adhesive. A dried thick, continuous (stiff) coating
                  of an adhesive will need to deform or soften in order to
                  uniformly connect the two undulating surfaces. In this case,
                  heat and high pressure can expedite and ensure a good bond,
                  but often at the expense of paint modification and
                  impregnation of nonoriginal materials into the original
                  textile and decorative layers. In the mist-lining system, the
                  “fluffy” adhesive layer has a volume that accommodates the
                  distance between the two woven textiles. During lining, gentle
                  pressure is sufficient to ensure that the two canvases remain
                  connected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The adhesive is reactivated in-situ using solvent vapors.
                  Solvent exposure induces swelling, allowing the adhesive to
                  regenerate and become tacky. The volume of solvent vapors
                  required to regenerate the adhesive is carefully calculated to
                  ensure that the adhesive swells and becomes sticky, but does
                  not dissolve, ensuring that the adhesive remains between the
                  lining and the original canvas. Solvent selection is dependent
                  upon a number of factors, including the sensitivity of paint
                  and varnish layers, the condition of the reverse of the
                  original support, any remnants of previous lining adhesives,
                  and, of course, the solubility parameters of the adhesive.
                  Acrylic dispersions are sensitive to a range of solvents,
                  including alcohols and aromatic hydrocarbons.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  Mixtures of these can also be considered. The choice of
                  solvent(s), duration of exposure to solvent vapors, and the
                  pressure exerted within the low-pressure envelope will affect
                  the bond strength achieved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Testing ensures that the best solvent is selected. We
                  recommend using smaller sections of a representative lining
                  canvas sprayed with a similar amount of adhesive to test for
                  an effective representative bond. Sections are placed on the
                  reverse of the original and exposed to different preselected
                  solvent vapors for the same amount of time. The sections are
                  left under weight until the solvent has evaporated, and then
                  each is peeled away evaluating the effectiveness of the bond.
                  Experience builds an expectation of results, but tests do
                  ensure a better understanding of the individual variables that
                  can be implemented for particular cases.

                  Effecting a Mist Lining
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The lining is carried out within the low-pressure envelope
                  ([<strong>fig. 9.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/9-Seymour/fig-9-4)).
                  First, the solvent vapors are introduced into the envelope
                  using a “solvent-delivery cloth”—typically, an open-weave
                  cotton cheesecloth. The ability of the solvent-delivery cloth
                  to absorb the solvents used will dictate the volume of solvent
                  that is needed; the volume used at SRAL is 60 ml of solvent
                  per square meter of cheesecloth. The cheesecloth should be
                  slightly larger than the area of sprayed adhesive, as it will
                  shrink slightly as the fluid solvent is absorbed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The solvent-delivery cloth is rolled up and encapsulated in
                  plastic (clingfilm or Saran wrap) before the solvent is
                  introduced. The solvent is injected into the package using a
                  needle and syringe. Sufficient time must be allowed before
                  placing the solvent-delivery cloth in the envelope for the
                  solvent to spread evenly throughout the cloth. When the
                  solvent has evenly dampened the solvent-delivery cloth and the
                  lining set up is established, it is rolled out inside the
                  envelope, placed at the reverse of the lining canvas, as can
                  be seen in [<strong>fig. 9.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/9-Seymour/fig-9-5).
                  Placing the cloth in the envelope and rolling it out inside
                  the envelope should be practiced until it can be done quickly
                  enough that solvent is not lost through evaporation (during
                  the application process).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The solvent vapors, thus delivered, defuse through the lining
                  fabric to the open adhesive network. Once the adhesive is
                  tacky (but not dissolved), the solvent-delivery cloth is
                  removed; typically, this takes between ten and twenty minutes.
                  Air is extracted from the envelope to expedite the activation
                  time, but continual pressure is not necessary at this stage.
                  The solvent-delivery cloth should be replaced with a dry cloth
                  to facilitate solvent evaporation during bond formation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once the solvent-delivery cloth has been removed, the air is
                  extracted from the low-pressure envelope. This causes the two
                  canvases to be drawn together and the reactivated, (thin)
                  adhesive spray coating can bridge distance between the two.
                  Pressure is maintained until the majority of solvent vapors
                  have evaporated and the adhesive is reset. The amount of
                  pressure in the envelope is determined by the degree of air
                  extracted by the centrifugal fan and the thickness/stiffness
                  of the plastic sheeting. Typically, values of 90 mbar are
                  reached and maintained for about sixty to ninety minutes. For
                  safety reasons, as solvent vapors are being passed through an
                  electrical motor, an attendant should be present at all times
                  during the lining. The risk of sparks igniting dust particles
                  within the motor should be prevented by using the motor
                  exclusively for air extraction. Air exchange values can be
                  used to reduce risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We recommend that conservators experiment and become
                  comfortable with the system variables before undertaking a
                  mist lining. Results are impressive ([<strong>figs. 9.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/9-Seymour/fig-9-6)
                  and

                  Aspects to consider are pretreatments, thickness of the
                  adhesive layer, the type of solvents and lining canvas
                  selected, and the setup of the envelope.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  The SRAL team has imparted our knowledge and experiences of
                  the Mist-Lining system to the wider conservation field over
                  the years (see Appendix for a chronology of workshops and
                  conferences disseminating the mist-lining system). Students
                  studying conservation in The Netherlands have been instructed
                  in the system since the early 1990s. International interns,
                  fellows, and junior conservators working at SRAL over the past
                  thirty years have all used the system. Papers have been
                  written describing it, and presentations have been given at
                  conferences (see [Barbosa et
                  al.](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/9-Seymour/paper-54)

                  Dissemination has had successes and failures and has led to
                  further modifications in the system. The expertise of the
                  system still remains largely in-house at SRAL, however, and
                  the use of this relatively new system is not widespread.
                  Because the system is adaptive and tailored to the needs of
                  the painting, it is full of variables that may be difficult to
                  grasp if not encountered in practice. Thus, confidence in
                  considering this non-invasive and gentle approach to the
                  structural repair of canvases may be lacking in many
                  conservators less familiar with the system.

                  In 2019, with the generous support of the Getty Foundation’s
                  Conserving Canvas Initiative, SRAL organized the Mist-Lining
                  Workshop to further disseminate this technique and share our
                  experiences. The aim was to provide midcareer conservators
                  from different world regions with hands-on experience of this
                  alternative option for the structural repair of canvas
                  paintings. At the same time, this global group also brought
                  new thoughts and inspired further adaptations and developments
                  of the mist-lining system ([[Nadeau et al. 2020]]). The
                  workshop was documented in film and print. The video, produced

                  It is full of information on case studies, material
                  information, and sources. Once practiced, the mist-lining
                  system’s variables become something that the conservator can
                  use to tailor treatment to the particular needs of each case.
                  The materials and equipment needed are low cost and relatively
                  easy to source locally. We hope that these new resources will
                  give this viable system new traction as a treatment option.

                <p>
                  The mist-lining system remains frequently used at SRAL. A
                  numerical quantification of paintings treated with this system
                  has not been carried out. However, it is safe to say that over
                  the past thirty years, some hundreds of paintings, belonging
                  to local, national, and international collections have been
                  treated by the SRAL team using this process. To date, none of
                  any of those so treated have been returned due to failure of
                  the lining. This body of work provides empirical confirmation
                  of the success of the system. Of course, failures—or rather,
                  disappointments—have occurred. These setbacks are typically
                  evident immediately after lining, before the artwork is
                  returned to its collection, and thus can be resolved
                  immediately. Reflecting on these complications provides
                  learning lessons for the SRAL team and encourages further
                  developments or adaptations of the system.

                  Conservation ethics have shifted over the past decades towards
                  a minimal approach and avoidance of invasive treatments. The
                  change in ethos to the structural repair of canvases allows
                  the conservator to identify and find solutions to separate
                  problems presented by the painting. Lining has become, with
                  the mist-lining system, a custom action. There are, of course,
                  drawbacks to lining with this system, such as covering the
                  original canvas from view and using solvent vapors to
                  regenerate the lining adhesive, because those vapors permeate
                  throughout the painting structure. However, the choice of
                  adhesive and its relatively long-term chemical stability mean
                  that the adhesive bond can be reversed in the future. The
                  original reverse of the canvas can thus be regained, if
                  necessary, as the adhesive remains primarily on the lining
                  canvas when delining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The idea that the original canvas will never be the same again
                  after a lining is carried out can now be left behind. The
                  mist-lining system is noninvasive and can provide additional
                  support for canvases without changing the stiffness of the
                  original canvas and without influencing the appearance or
                  saturation of the paint layers. While this process may not be
                  the only modern solution to resolve this new way of thinking,
                  it is an effective and versatile technique that has been used
                  successfully for the last thirty years at SRAL and elsewhere
                  to line a vast number of damaged paintings—and to reline
                  paintings previously lined with glue-paste or wax-resin
                  adhesives.

                  The author, a liner with long experience in structural
                  conservation of paintings, describes the huge changes he has
                  seen over the past forty years, specifically in the Italian
                  context. Along a path that has passed from tradition to
                  alternative synthetic materials and minimalism, the author
                  learned to adopt an attitude of respecting each painting and
                  adapting treatment to its individual needs while maintaining
                  safety. The essay focuses on a reconsideration and revaluation
                  of traditional methods—whether they can be still used and if
                  their characteristics can be better described from a chemical
                  and mechanical perspective.

                <p>
                  Forty years has passed since I first stepped into a
                  conservation studio. I have spent all those years in Italy,
                  but I have also had the opportunity to travel and build strong
                  friendships with colleagues over the world. Working with them,
                  I realized that each of us comes from a specific background
                  that has particular economic issues, culture, and conservation
                  management, all of which has influenced our training,
                  knowledge, approaches, methodologies, and working practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Italy is a small and challenging country with a huge heritage
                  to preserve and a very long conservation history that has
                  influenced generations of conservators in Europe. Because of
                  this richness, in 1939, Italy established precise rules and
                  roles to defend and protect its heritage based on central
                  control by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage ([[Coccolo
                  2017]]). The ministry fixes the scale of priorities, the way
                  projects have to be designed, and how cost estimates must be
                  calculated (often by the square meter). It is a low-value
                  economy, with private companies covering ninety percent of
                  active conservation, competing to reduce prices and trying to
                  work within tight schedules. It’s not necessary to describe in
                  detail how this public administration manages conservation
                  needs, but certainly one of the first concerns is how to be
                  sustainable without sacrificing quality of treatments. Our
                  community in Italy has suffered under this condition, and only
                  occasionally has it been possible to share our methods,
                  approach, problems, and concerns with an international
                  community. For this reason, I am deeply grateful to the Getty
                  Foundation for the great opportunity offered by the Conserving
                  Canvas initiative.

                <p>
                  At the Yale conference in 2019 we all focused on linings,
                  showing different approaches and methods, but only a few
                  presentations mentioned the need for some sort of
                  consolidation of the paint layers. In my practice I deal with
                  many different cases that show severe deterioration. What I
                  see, most of the time, apart from structural damage (tears,
                  accidents, deformation, etc.) is the loss of strength of all
                  original materials, due mostly to inappropriate environmental
                  conditions. I can’t mention all the different forms that the
                  degradation takes, but what worries me most is the increase in
                  porosity of many painting structures, the weakness of the
                  supports, the risk of losses, and in general the fragility of
                  these incredible artifacts ([<strong>fig. 10.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/fig-10-1)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consolidation is an irreversible process, and for this reason
                  it is viewed as an embarrassment, something that’s better not
                  to talk about. The Center for the Study of Restoration
                  Materials (CESMAR7), an Italian association devoted to
                  research on polychrome surfaces, organized two international
                  meetings on this specific issue in 2006 and 2008 ([[CESMAR7
                  2008]]; [[CESMAR7 2010]]). We realized at that time only a few
                  publications covered the subject and little research was being
                  done; it looked to us that everybody was trying to avoid this
                  field full of uncertainties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course, early lining methods were designed to provide some
                  sort of strength to the grounds and paint film by infusing
                  waxes, resins, and animal glues with the aid of huge pressures
                  and high temperatures. But to definitively step out of this
                  old story we have to design specific consolidation strategies
                  that are informed by a full understanding of the mechanical
                  stresses and damages and of the degree and speed of
                  deterioration of each component.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  To do honest work we should openly discuss many of our totems
                  and try to establish a path toward an adequate decision-making
                  process ([[Ciatti and Signorini 2007]]; [[Michalski and
                  Rossi-Doria 2011]]; [[Rossi-Doria 2010]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consolidation involves a vast amount of knowledge and
                  difficult ethical issues. Each of us has developed a personal
                  framework to understand what the needs are in terms of
                  consolidation, considering future deterioration and designing
                  specific strategies that can guarantee efficacy and respect
                  for the features of original materials—a difficult but
                  necessary task—and we first must understand the best way to
                  achieve a reliable result: from the front, or from the back?
                  It’s a never-ending story, and each of us has his or her own
                  ideas.

                <p>
                  I’m a witness to the changes in Italy on this issue. In the
                  past, we infused animal glues from the reverse, controlling
                  shrinkage dynamics, but then many liners started to consider
                  the increase in sensitivity to moisture and mechanical
                  stresses. After the disasters of the Florentine flood in 1966,
                  our community made a drastic change: the adoption of a total
                  infusion from the reverse of synthetic consolidants, such as
                  Paraloid B‑72, Plexisol, Beva, and others. These were able to
                  strengthen the canvas fibers, treat the excessive porosity,
                  and consolidate degraded paint layers. My generation dedicated
                  a lot of effort to establishing how to manage this difficult
                  task—testing and selecting materials, looking for appropriate
                  concentrations and applications, and finding solvents of lower
                  toxicity. This helped to separate the structural treatment
                  into different steps, where consolidation was one part and
                  lining another. The impact of minimalism pushed us to always
                  look for a compromise between respect for original materials
                  and the need for remedial conservation, dependent on the next
                  steps of treatment as well as the quality of the future
                  environment (rarely stable, rarely monitored).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Synthetic consolidants, in general, produced lower mechanical
                  stresses and had lower reactivity to moisture than traditional
                  consolidants; this in turn stimulated the search for
                  glue-paste linings with reduced shrinkage risk.

                  In my presentation at the conference I showed how lining
                  history developed in Italy through the centuries by focusing
                  on a specific family that worked for 295 years on Roman
                  heritage. Other contributions in this publication describe in
                  more detail the cultural and methodological environment in
                  which Italian liners designed different methods and
                  approaches, mostly in Rome, Florence, Venice, Turin, Naples,
                  Bergamo, and Bologna. It is an extraordinary history of
                  skills, human capacities, and courage, one which produced some
                  mistakes but also wonderful results, considering the
                  difficulties liners had in those times.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During my career I have had to remove some of these old
                  linings and many times I could assess how respectful they
                  were, still showing adequate adhesion after three hundred
                  years but also easy to remove ([<strong>fig. 10.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/fig-10-2)).
                  The most interesting observation is the stability they often
                  show when mounted on strainers with no means of expansion.
                  These skilled artisans changed and modified their methods over
                  time, and this history still belongs to our cultural
                  environment, despite huge changes in the last fifty years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My practice was influenced by the “Roman method” designed by
                  the Istituto Centrale per il Restauro (ICR). This method was
                  brought to the ICR by assistants to Mauro Pelliccioli, a
                  famous Italian restorer from Bergamo who was called to provide
                  linings for war-damaged paintings. In 1963, facing the
                  restoration of the three big paintings by Caravaggio, Giovanni
                  Urbani, the head of paintings labs, refined the method by
                  introducing the use of temporary expandable metal lining
                  stretchers, instead of the heavy wooden looms that were unable
                  to control tension during the lining process. The original
                  Bergamo recipe went through some modifications, as did the
                  ironing process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the next forty years Italians continued to line paintings
                  using traditional methods, with some modifications. The big
                  campaigns of restoration after the war, after the Florence
                  flood, in Venice, and in Rome from 1980 to 2000, confirmed the
                  big differences between regional traditions. One example of
                  this dynamic is the existence of two official Italian
                  methods—the Florentine and the Roman—designed respectively by
                  the Opificio delle Pietre Dure and ICR, both part of the same
                  institution, the Ministry of Cultural Heritage ([[Phenix
                  1995]]; [[Stoner and Rushfield 2012]]).

                <p>
                  Working with glue-paste adhesives has been a necessity in my
                  work. It’s not that I thought that these methods could be
                  applied to all kinds of paintings—many would show problems, so
                  it was necessary to be confident in the use of other methods
                  and materials. It has always been obvious to me that no one
                  treatment can be the magical one that solves all problems
                  without causing any changes. For this reason, I always tried
                  to widen my list of options and to adapt myself to many
                  working conditions, from minimalism and the decision to avoid
                  lining altogether up to (respectful) ways to use synthetic
                  adhesives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As mentioned earlier, sustainability is a crucial issue. The
                  traditional glue-paste methods are low cost, easily used
                  on-site, and don’t require special equipment. Apart from being
                  the only method that is completely nontoxic, it can be
                  extremely effective, respectful, totally reversible, and able
                  to provide stability and the desired stiffness. This is
                  possible because it is adaptable and open to many
                  modifications, as we will see later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For these reasons, in 1995 I started to reconsider all aspects
                  of traditional methods. It has been a long process and remains
                  a work in progress. In the last ten years, I intensified my
                  studies, assessed test results, worked with international
                  researchers, and monitored long-term results.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A big concern is mold growth and attack by
                  <em>Stegobium paniceum</em> (the only insect we find on
                  linings). All natural materials are hygroscopic and have that
                  element of risk, but our observations in Italy indicate that
                  problems occur only in specific microclimates with long
                  exposure to high RH and poor ventilation. Recent tests
                  ([[Fuster-López et al. 2017]]; see also [Fuster-López et al.
                  in this

                  demonstrate that the use of close-weave fabrics and some
                  traditional ingredients—such as rye flour and molasses—can
                  increase the risk. A good backing board, some space between
                  the painting and the wall, and some basic control of damp will
                  reduce this risk in a very effective way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What worries me most about traditional linings is the amount
                  of adhesive applied to the reverse of the painting. Excessive
                  amounts (we might say abusive amounts) of adhesive, of very
                  strong glues, increase the sensitivity to humidity variations,
                  resulting in mechanical stresses being transmitted to the
                  paint layers.

                  The results of the ICOM-CC International Working Group,

                  represent the first attempt at a scientific assessment of
                  glue-paste linings. Some conservators have published results
                  before this of experiments with modified recipes ([[Ackroyd
                  1995]]), but a full understanding was missing. Now, for the
                  first time, it has become possible to study the influence of
                  different materials and different application methods from a
                  mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological point of view,
                  and to establish precise parameters for further investigation.

                  Geographically, the list of materials used in traditional
                  linings is more or less similar, with local variations in the
                  natural fabrics and adhesive mixtures. This section is based

                  Over the centuries, liners have never stopped discussing the
                  selection of the best lining canvas to use, and the search
                  continues to this day—although we now use a more quantitative
                  approach ([[Young 1999]]). The selection of the fabric affects
                  the method, the adhesive application, and many other factors.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  Liners have used close-weave canvases across many local
                  traditions: Florence, France, the UK, the Netherlands,
                  Belgium, Denmark. The shared concept is uniform glue
                  application between the two canvases: the original and the
                  lining. The canvas behaves as a semirigid support stiffened by
                  animal glue, and adhesion is optimized by ironing, which dries
                  the adhesive while applying pressure on the painting surface
                  to flatten deformation or cupping. The glue layer, applied in
                  an even adhesive film (in some traditions quite thickly),
                  carries most of the load of the painting because close-weave
                  fabrics provide poor grip, have high elastic modulus, but
                  develop more mechanical stresses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Observations from monitoring insect infestations shows an
                  increase of deterioration in close-weave linings due to the
                  fact that insects living in the glue layer are protected from
                  ventilation, light, and predators.

                  <em>Open-weave canvases</em>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Open-weave fabrics are part of the Italian and Spanish
                  traditions. In Italy, all methods apart from the Florentine
                  apply open-weave canvases. Often, on big, heavy, damaged
                  paintings, two similar fabrics were stretched on the same loom
                  to obtain a stiffer support.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In my experience, open-weave fabrics don’t need to be washed
                  (unless thread count exceeds 12 to 14 threads per square
                  centimeter), so one can keep the stable materials introduced
                  during production that are used to protect the fibers, such as
                  starches, methylcellulose, and butyl acrylates. They provide a
                  better grip than close-weave fabrics, and the glue film is not
                  continuous, similar to a nap bond. These fabrics are lighter,
                  they transmit less mechanical stress, and are less reactive to
                  RH variation. Mold can develop more easily than on close-weave
                  fabrics, but insects, on the other hand, have a more difficult
                  life.

                  These results confirmed my attitude to using them as lining
                  canvases. Open-weave fabrics can have various fiber densities
                  (from 8 x 8 to 14 x 12), as well as various thread dimensions
                  and torsions, thereby providing a range of performance in
                  terms of support, stiffness, and capacity to stabilize
                  deformations.

                  The revalidation of traditional materials and methods led me
                  to study and then compare recipes used in glue-paste linings.
                  First, I asked myself if the term <em>glue paste</em> properly
                  describes these mixtures. I looked for a more precise name,
                  settling on <em>water-based adhesive gels.</em> The name
                  identifies the principal features of the two main
                  ingredients—flour and animal gelatin—and their unique capacity
                  to trap water for a long time. As they were only adhesive
                  materials available for centuries, it is interesting to assess
                  how restorers varied the way they used them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then I started to study what these ingredients are from a
                  chemical, physical-mechanical, and biological point of view. I
                  had to admit that many of the notions I had received during
                  training were totally insufficient or, in many cases, simply
                  wrong. It took time to realize that conservation science
                  rarely looked at other fields that research these natural
                  materials, such as the food industry, cosmetics, and
                  pharmaceuticals. Multinational companies invest heavily in
                  ongoing studies to optimize their products and their ability
                  to manipulate these natural materials.

                  Apart from the Russian tradition, where only sturgeon glue and
                  some honey was used, all other methods built their recipes
                  using three main groups of ingredients: fillers (wheat and rye
                  flours), materials with adhesive properties (animal gelatins),
                  and additives that modify some of the mechanical properties
                  (honey, molasses, Venetian turpentine, linseed mucilage,
                  vinegar, oxgall, glycerin, oils). I will not focus on this
                  last class of materials because, in reality, they have a
                  marginal role in mechanical behavior in glue-paste linings.
                  Instead, I think it is useful to focus on the two main
                  ingredients: animal gels and flours.

                  These amazing materials are used in many steps of treatment—as
                  an adhesive for facings, a consolidant for paint film
                  decohesion, an ingredient in glue-paste compositions, and as a
                  binder for fillings. In tests over the years, animal glues
                  were chosen for their high strength compared to all synthetic
                  materials. I think it is useful, therefore, to establish some
                  essential information that will guide how and why they can be
                  used ([[Pearson 2003]]; [[Schellmann 2007]]; [[Bigi,
                  Panzavolta, and Rubini 2004]]).

                  Animal gels are produced in two different ways: Type 1 with
                  acid, and Type 2 with alkaline treatments. Mostly conservators
                  work with Type 1 for their higher adhesive properties and gel
                  strength. Manufacturers and mostly wholesale sellers and
                  traders established in Asia (China, Vietnam, Cambodia, India),
                  and to a lesser extend in North America, produce a huge
                  variety of blends for food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.

                  Gel strength (GS) is measured in terms of the Bloom
                  number.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  Manufacturers produce gelatins with different Bloom values for
                  different intended uses by varying the fundamental steps in
                  biochemical treatments and number of extractions. Of course,
                  the quality of collagen and basic materials plays a big role,
                  as do other additives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Depending on Bloom value, gelatins vary their behavior with
                  moisture and their rate of sorption and desorption. Mechanical
                  tests in the conservation literature show curves measured at
                  different RH values but, until now, none of them has specified
                  the gel strength, only the general type of gelatin: rabbit,
                  sturgeon, hide, or bone. Because it’s difficult to find
                  precise technical data on gelatin suppliers’ labeling, it’s
                  probably necessary to develop our manual and sensory skills to
                  (at least) establish a method to estimate gel strength.
                  Specific features can be interpreted and evaluated to
                  correlate with the Bloom scale: speed and quantity of water
                  absorption/release, speed of gel degradation, color, smell,
                  viscosity, time of tack, and gel stiffness. Sturgeon bladder
                  glue Bloom values have only recently been investigated. (All
                  the samples I tried had different Bloom values, as did other
                  gelatins, and any considerations related to flexibility or the
                  higher stability of bladder collagen are not correct if not
                  related to measured Bloom and RH values [[<strong>fig. 10.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/fig-10-3)]
                  ([[Bridarolli et al. 2022]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The range of Bloom values for an animal glue suitable for
                  paintings conservation starts at approximately 150 to 400.
                  Bloom 250 is an average that can be used for most of the
                  purposes mentioned, but it is also possible to define more
                  precise values for each use. Lower Bloom solutions have lower
                  viscosity and longer setting/gelling times (but less
                  strength), so these are useful when better penetration is
                  needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Higher Bloom values provide the opposite: higher viscosity at
                  a given concentration, higher adhesive capacities and tack,
                  faster setting times, less response to short-term RH
                  fluctuations, and more resistance to biological deterioration.
                  They also require higher water temperature for dissolution.
                  Bloom 250 can be used for effective facings and for fillings.
                  Higher values, up to 350, can be used in glue-paste mixtures.
                  Working concentrations vary depending on the gel strength.
                  Working temperatures of 50°C–65°C play a crucial role in
                  reducing viscosity so as to facilitate penetration, whereas
                  room temperatures facilitate the gelling process and reduce
                  penetration.

                  Animal glues lose their properties if exposed to high

                <h4 id="flours" tabindex="-1"><em>Flours</em></h4>
                <p>
                  Liners have used flours from various grains since the
                  beginning. The reason is simple: they were easy to find and
                  prepare, they were (and remain) very cheap, and they provide
                  good adhesion, tack, and a nice stiffness. Their unbelievable
                  mechanical properties ([[Delcour and Hoseney 2010]]) have been
                  exploited by humans in thousands of different ways, depending
                  on materials’ availability and local culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Flour plus water plus heat produces a gel with amazing
                  capacities to trap water and keep it suspended for a long
                  time. Properties can be varied depending on the type of grain
                  and the complex biochemical reactions of their preparation. In
                  conservation, only wheat and rye flours were used since they
                  had better mechanical properties than other grains.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each flour has a different ratio of the two main components:
                  starches and proteins. Wheat flour contains 70%–75% starch,
                  8%–14% proteins, and other substances in small amounts
                  (lipids, polysaccharides, fibers). Cereal and food science
                  produces thousands of research articles about the manipulation
                  of flour properties by the variety of grain and variation in
                  the enzymes of starch and protein.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The capacity to easily manipulate any single component gives
                  the possibility of designing specific blends depending on
                  needs. In 2018, while looking at these possibilities, I
                  thought it would be valuable to follow some of this research
                  to understand if, going outside the limits of edibility, it
                  was possible to design a blend that could be used as an
                  adhesive generally—specifically as a lining adhesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Starches contain two different polysaccharides—amylopectin and
                  amylase—in an 80:20 ratio, both insoluble in water without
                  heat (&gt;65°C). By slightly changing this ratio we can change
                  the stiffness: greater flexibility by increasing amylopectine
                  or greater stiffness by increasing amylose. This ratio is
                  reflected in the protein content of a specific flour.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Proteins in wheat starch are mostly composed of glutenin and
                  gliadin, which form, when hydrated, gluten. By changing the
                  ratio of these two proteins or modifying the total amount, the
                  food industry produces different blends that differ in their
                  “strength.” Strength is measured by the W index, which tells
                  us how resistant a dough is in the rising process and how long
                  it retains water and fermentation gas (carbon dioxide). For
                  conservation purposes, a low W (120–170) provides a stiffer
                  film when dry; conversely, increasing the protein content and
                  W to 350–400 makes the film softer and more flexible. Results
                  coming from the ICOM-CC glue-paste project (see [Fuster- López
                  et al.
                  2022](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/paper-52))
                  suggest that a higher gluten content reduces water absorption,
                  provides lower wetting capacities, and reduces reactivity to
                  RH variations.

                  70:30. The first is W 180–250 and the second W 350. The flour
                  blend is dissolved in water in a ratio of 1:3, then heated at
                  65°C–70°C until a gel develops.

                <p>
                  Animal glue gel (Bloom 250–350) that has been previously
                  prepared in water in a ratio of 1:3 at 55°C is then dissolved
                  into the warm flour mixture. A small amount of alum salts is
                  also added at this stage as a biocide and thickener. The
                  amount of animal glue in the recipe can vary but it is always
                  much less than in most traditional methods. This drastic
                  reduction in glue is necessary to decrease reactivity and
                  mechanical stresses. All additional substances are, in my
                  opinion, useless, and should be avoided.

                  dispersion: 2% to 10%, depending on needs. This product, low
                  cost and easy to find, can improve the adhesive bonding that
                  was lost due to the reduction of animal glue, as well as
                  increase flexibility. At the same time, it drastically
                  decreases water capacity, thereby speeding the drying process,
                  while providing good initial tack. Further research will
                  probably confirm the amount of risk reduction in terms of
                  reactivity and biodeterioration reduction. This adhesive
                  mixture will always be easily reversible, being soluble in
                  water. Any residue can be gently rubbed off.

                  reduced lining canvas reactivity by infusing hydrophobic
                  substances such as wax and synthetic polymers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many conservators treat support and surface deformations using
                  a combination of tension, pressure, humidity, and such
                  procedures as low-pressure, vacuum, and others. I do that too,
                  and results can be extremely successful, but without any
                  stabilization, the “memory” of deformations will cause them to
                  reappear, sooner or later. It’s an old story, but we still
                  need to discuss it.

                  The Lining Process
                </h2>
                <h3 id="facing" tabindex="-1">Facing</h3>
                <p>
                  This crucial step of structural treatment is not always
                  necessary, but it is if one has fragile paint that is at high
                  risk of paint loss during subsequent steps of treatment,
                  especially when removing previous lining materials. In that
                  case, any glue or adhesive applied on the front will try to
                  flow through the porosity and fill the gaps caused by
                  cleavage, delamination, and losses. The selection of a
                  respectful facing adhesive depends on the nature of the paint
                  layers, and wrong decisions can cause damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a facing material I selected a pure-cellulose tissue with
                  13 grams wet strength that has been calendared to be water
                  resistant. The adhesive is applied through the tissue, as with
                  Japanese paper facings. It sets quickly and adapts well to a
                  variety of surface morphologies. Wrinkles are easy to remove.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The glue can be applied in different ways depending on the
                  needs of the treatment plan—by brush or sprayed gently on the
                  surface. It is easy to manipulate the concentration, Bloom
                  values (200–250), and viscosities to achieve the desired
                  result in terms of adhesion, preconsolidation, or treatment of
                  deformations, by exploiting a mix of traditional Japanese
                  paper conservation techniques with similar Italian traditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When dry, the wet strength tissue provides good protection
                  from mechanical stresses applied from the back to remove old
                  canvases and glues. It also provides a barrier to infused
                  consolidants, avoiding solvent migration to the front, and
                  also really helps in stabilizing surface deformations such as
                  bad crack patterns. In addition, these facing are easy to
                  remove and do not leave fibers on the paint surface.
                </p>
                <h3 id="lining" tabindex="-1">Lining</h3>
                <p>
                  The lining process is extremely simplified. The selected open
                  weave canvas is stretched on a provisional expandable lining
                  stretcher that can accommodate a wide range of dimensions and
                  consistently control canvas tension ([<strong>fig. 10.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/fig-10-5)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The adhesive mixture is then applied on the reverse of the
                  painting in an even coat, and the working stretcher is
                  correctly positioned on top of it. More adhesive is applied to
                  wet the new canvas and provide a first bonding ([<strong>figs. 10.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/fig-10-6)
                  and
                  [<strong>10.7</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/fig-10-7)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The glue application behaves as a very slow humidifier that
                  relaxes deformation and distortions. It is possible to set the
                  time for an even humidification process, depending on the
                  degree of deformation. In cases where deformations have been
                  pretreated and the painting is flat, one can immediately apply
                  gentle tension to the lining canvas and remove excess adhesive
                  by manually pressing with wooden spatulas and other tools for
                  an even application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Drying time can vary depending on the need for additional
                  humidification to soften hard cracks and surface deformation.
                  In cases where we don’t have such needs, the painting can dry
                  without any additional operation, and ironing can be avoided.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Manual ironing is an option to treat surface deformation once
                  it has been humidified by the glue during the lining process.
                  It is possible to achieve great results without using huge
                  pressure or high temperatures. Bad crack patterns can be
                  flattened by locally applying additional moisture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of the drying process, the facing can be removed
                  easily.
                </p>
                <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  Looking ahead, it is possible that these methods will
                  disappear from the accepted list of lining options and be
                  mentioned only in lectures on the history of conservation—or
                  will remain in use only by traditional liners in the private
                  sector. However, I think that omitting this information risks
                  the next generation of conservators losing a full
                  understanding of how to properly preserve many thousands of
                  glue-paste-lined paintings all over the world. I hope this
                  paper can contribute to a better understanding of the
                  potentialities, features, and behavior of water-based
                  adhesives, as well as stimulate the curiosity to finally
                  assess them in a rational, open-minded way ([[Rossi-Doria
                  2013]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As mentioned, I do work with other materials—Beva and
                  acrylics—as other options. These alternative methods have
                  their advantages and disadvantages, the latter mostly due to
                  the use of high temperatures or solvents for reactivation;
                  these linings have low elastic modulus and are quite difficult
                  to remove without additional heat or solvents. The recent
                  habit to use Beva film extensively worries me, just as Vishwa
                  Mehra in 1970 was scared by wax and its abuse. I hope we can
                  soon reconsider this habit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even when using these modern procedures, I try to apply the
                  same approach I use for traditional materials—looking for more
                  respectful applications and avoiding flow of the adhesive
                  inside the painting structure. I hope it will soon be possible
                  to dedicate another paper to this topic.

                  to solve certain complex problems on a large-size painting on

                  “We are firmly convinced that there cannot be a single method
                  valid for every painting—not only for obvious reasons related
                  to the nature of the work, but above all because of the
                  individual ‘character’ of the painting, with its ‘own’ fabric,
                  its ‘own’ ground preparation, its ‘own’ pigment and its ‘own’
                  reaction to the passage of time. It follows that if there is
                  no single method and no single material appropriate to every
                  picture, it must and will be for the painting itself to impose
                  a careful choice between the various methods and materials”
                  ([[Baldini and Taiti 2003|, 115]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The quotation above is an excerpt from Sergio Taiti and
                  Umberto Baldini’s address at the Greenwich lining conference
                  in 1974. Sergio Taiti had been chief conservator for
                  structural treatments on canvas at Opificio delle Pietre Dure
                  of Florence for about twenty years and during his tenure he
                  distinguished himself for having a deep sensitivity toward the
                  specific characteristics of paintings. We didn’t have the
                  opportunity to meet him in person, but we had our training in
                  canvas conservation with Luciano Sostegni, who worked closely
                  with him for a long time and became his successor at the
                  Fortezza da Basso’s Laboratories. Although our profession led
                  us to test and use new and different materials and methods,
                  his teachings remain the basis for our approach to work and we
                  are still firmly convinced of their validity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe that preliminary study of a painting, in order to
                  deeply understand its materials and technique as well as its
                  present condition, is essential to define customized
                  treatments for conservation. From this point of view, we try
                  not to focus on only a single material or methodology;
                  instead, during the preliminary decision-making phase, we
                  usually take into account a wide range of possibilities. By
                  doing so, we allow ourselves the chance to decide to employ
                  different materials in different ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moreover, we consider the minimal intervention approach as our
                  guide, but we believe that some clarification about this
                  matter is needed. We think that the <em>minimum</em> should
                  definitely be calibrated to the specific needs of the artwork,
                  in order to solve its conservation problems, slow its
                  degradation process, and try to avoid further treatments in
                  the near future. If keeping the treatment to a minimum means
                  minimizing the impact of conservation on the artwork, we
                  should consider only treatments that actually solve the
                  identified problems. For example, neglecting to guarantee the
                  color or the priming layers’ adhesion to the original support
                  effectively might lead the painting to undergo another
                  conservation treatment within a short time, and this will
                  probably result in a more stressful and invasive practice in
                  the end. At this point, can we say that we have kept our
                  treatment to the minimum needed, or should we admit that what
                  we have done is not enough appropriate to the conservation
                  needs of that individual artwork?
                </p>
                <p>
                  For a decade we have adopted and promoted a diagnostic
                  protocol<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  aimed at defining a more accurate and objective situation to
                  provide additional information to help the conservator (with
                  his own experience) in choosing a more appropriate
                  methodology, specifically suited to the artwork’s structural
                  conservation conditions.

                  The painting by Allesandro Allori represents the
                  <em>Allegory with the Triumph of Florence</em> and measures
                  about thirty square meters. It was created in 1588–89 to
                  celebrate the marriage of Ferdinando I, grand duke of Tuscany,
                  to Christine of Lorraine, and was located outdoors, above the
                  arch of the Florentine Porta al Prato. The scene was painted
                  with a leanly bound oil, applied in thin and even layers. The
                  fine linen canvas was made of four pieces, whose selvages were
                  positioned horizontally and sewn together. The support was
                  prepared with a thin, light gray ground, probably using animal
                  glue and a little linseed oil as a binder.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When we first examined the painting, it was in storage at the
                  Pitti Palace. The canvas was mounted on a three-part folding
                  wooden stretcher ([<strong>fig. 11.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/fig-11-1)),
                  probably provided after the canvas was lined with a glue-paste
                  adhesive in the early part of the twentieth century. The
                  painting suffered new damage during the flood of Florence in
                  1966: it was partially impregnated with water, mud, and
                  naphtha (which had leaked from buildings’ heating systems and
                  was carried by the flood water), and diffused biological
                  growth developed. Repeated handling of the folded painting
                  over time had led to the permanent deformation of the original
                  canvas along the perimeter, resulting in a 15-cm extension at
                  the edges compared to the middle area of the support width.
                  The old lining adhesion was compromised, with evident and
                  diffused blistering. Over two hundred new tears, cuts, and
                  holes weakened the canvas and some patches had been glued to
                  the back of the lining, using animal glue or wax-resin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thick mud residues, molds, and patches were also visible on
                  the front. The original seams appeared partially ripped and
                  deformed, and extensive fillings and retouching on the paint
                  layers were mostly applied on these areas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  The painting had been folded with the painted side face in.
                  and this led to the detachment and loss of thousands of paint
                  fragments. After the flood, an attempt to fix unstable paint
                  layers was carried out using wax. This led to the complete
                  waterproofing of some localized areas, especially around the
                  seams joining the pieces of the original canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main problems to solve were reducing the huge deformations
                  of the canvas, restoring the compromised structural integrity
                  of the support, providing a good adhesion between the paint
                  layers and the original canvas and, finally, the evaluation of
                  the ability of the support to undergo a new tensioning on the
                  stretcher, considering its large size and significant weight.

                  To define the methodological choices and the materials to use,
                  compatibility with the original materials, use of minimum
                  amounts of new materials, and future reversibility were all
                  considered. Since full reversibility of binding agents for
                  consolidation or adhesives that impregnate the paint layers is
                  often impossible, it was important to us to leave open the
                  possibility to use a wide range of materials in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Three main operating activities to reflect on were identified:
                  the facing, the re‑adhesion of the paint layers to the
                  support, and the lining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  These three phases are clearly separate, even if strongly
                  interconnected, especially with regard to facing and
                  consolidation. This is due not only to the need for
                  compatibility with the painting materials, but above all for
                  the intimate connection taking place during the intervention.
                  Treating the canvas from the back with an adhesive to fix
                  flaking paint layers will probably lead to the impregnation of
                  the faced surface. It is then crucial to consider products
                  with similar properties and solubility—or at least to evaluate
                  the possible interactions of materials. This is important to
                  ensure the correct and easy removal of the facing. For that
                  reason, theoretical considerations were thought over and tests
                  were run to select the best material to solve the specific
                  problems mentioned above.
                </p>

                  In order to facilitate the flattening of the canvas and to be
                  sure of safeguarding the appearance of the lean oil technique,
                  an aqueous method was preferred and adhesives like extra-fine
                  rabbit skin glue and Aquazol were tested.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before facing the surface, dust and mud residue were carefully
                  removed using soft brushes and swabs with deionized water.
                  Some local preventive fixing was needed to avoid color losses.
                  Old fills and retouching were eliminated, mold was removed,
                  and the areas affected were disinfected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the surface facing, a first flattening of the canvas’s
                  deformation was possible, thanks to the moisture added by the
                  aqueous adhesive and to some light tensioning provided by the
                  contraction of Japanese paper while drying ([<strong>fig. 11.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/fig-11-2)).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using a polystyrene roller, the painting was then turned
                  facedown to work on the back and remove the old lining adhered
                  with glue-paste.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  The residue of the old glue-paste was carefully removed with a
                  scalpel. In some problematic areas where the adhesive was
                  particularly tough, an agar gel<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  was used to swell and soften it, making removal easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All cuts were brought back to the correct position with the
                  aid of tension, applied using tie-beams adjusted by rubber
                  bands ([<strong>fig. 11.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/fig-11-3)),
                  and moisture, released through a Gore-Tex fabric. Polyester
                  fabric tie-beams were adhered to the back of the canvas with
                  original formula Beva 371 film. The humidification, tension,
                  and time needed were related to the extent of deformation
                  being treated. A polyester thread was used to resew the
                  selvages where necessary, passing through the holes of the
                  original seam, when possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many cycles of humidification and tension were needed to
                  flatten the canvas. Due to the very large size of the
                  painting, stretching it on a temporary loom was deemed
                  expensive and impractical, so it was decided to tension it on
                  a thin worktop placed directly on the floor. To do this,
                  strips of polyester canvas<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  were fixed to the perimeter with Beva 371 film, reactivated at
                  two different times: the first on the polyester canvas, at
                  80°C, and the second, on the back of the original canvas, at
                  65°C. This particular procedure is intended to create a
                  stronger bond between the adhesive and the polyester canvas
                  than between the adhesive and the original canvas, ensuring
                  better reversibility in the future. Ideally, no adhesive will
                  be left on the original canvas when the strips are removed; at
                  worst, only a few traces will remain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A complex problem we needed to solve was recovering the
                  adhesion of paint layers that had been treated with wax or
                  impregnated with nonpolar substances in the past, using an
                  aqueous adhesive. This was preferred to help the flattening of
                  the original canvas and to guarantee the easy removal of the
                  facing. Tests were performed to evaluate the strength of the
                  bond produced by extra-fine rabbit skin glue, sturgeon glue
                  and Aquazol 500 and 200 dissolved in water, ethanol, and
                  acetone. Aquazol 500 in acetone showed good adhesion
                  properties on wax samples.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  To adhere the paint layers to the original canvas, two coats
                  of Aquazol 500 were applied at two distinct times. First,
                  Aquazol 500 in acetone at 10%<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  was applied to guarantee good adhesion of the areas that
                  presented wax and nonpolar substances. Later, a second
                  application of the same resin dissolved at 5% in a solution of
                  acetone and water (1:1) was used to effectively increase the
                  flattening of the canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the complete evaporation of solvents, always keeping the
                  painting tensioned,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  the thermoplastic adhesive was reactivated by heat in a vacuum
                  bag (envelope). Heat was transferred to the adhesive using
                  water at a predetermined temperature, provided by a movable
                  temporary “tub.” The materials needed to carry out this
                  intervention are shown in [<strong>fig. 11.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/fig-11-4).
                  The painting was placed facedown in a vacuum bag made of
                  silicone-coated polyester film (Melinex). On the top of this
                  bag, a tub made of a Melinex sheet placed in a wooden loom<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  was prepared. A certain volume of water, preheated to a
                  predetermined temperature, was poured into the tub. After ten
                  minutes,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  the water was removed, and the tub was shifted to treat
                  another area. This operation was repeated to treat the whole
                  surface, always keeping the painting under pressure in the
                  vacuum bag.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s important to underline that this method is not an
                  alternative to the use of a hot table, but it permits heat
                  transfer from the back also when working with the painting
                  facedown is required.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  Using a vacuum system and applying heat through a tub
                  containing pre-heated water guarantees that the whole surface
                  is treated with the same pressure and temperature,
                  substantially reducing the risk of nonhomogeneous performance
                  of the thermoplastic adhesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In preparation for mending structural damages, some adhesives
                  were tested ([<strong>table 11.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/table-11-1)).
                  To avoid damage to the original canvas in the future, the
                  breaking point of the adhesive should be equal to or slightly
                  less than the toughness value of the original yarn (see
                  [[Orata 2009]]), measured by tension test with a dynamometer.
                  The adhesive with a breaking point that is similar to that of
                  the original yarn is highlighted in red in the table.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All the cuts, tears, and holes (more than two hundred) were
                  mended thread by thread using Akeogard AT35<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
                  applied with a tiny brush, using an optical visor. All the
                  structural damages and the four seams were further reinforced
                  by applying monofilament fabric patches adhered with a mixture
                  made of 80% Plextol B500 and 20% Dispersion K360, reactivated
                  by butyl acetate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the first steps of consolidation, tear mending, and
                  humidification complete, we evaluated if lining was really
                  necessary. A series of elements, such as the dimension of the
                  canvas in relation to its ability to support itself, the
                  presence of more than two hundred structural damages, the
                  advanced degradation of the cellulose, and the presence of
                  four horizontal seams, led us to the decision to apply an
                  auxiliary support. As mentioned, every case is unique, and
                  sometimes it is appropriate to assess the use of different
                  methods and materials for lining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Glue-paste lining did not seem suitable, not only because it
                  would increase the weight of the whole structure, but also
                  (mostly) due to the difficulty in maintaining the appearance
                  of the painted surface, preventing the seams’ stitches from
                  impressing on the front, and preserving the original seams.
                  Lining with Beva 371 was also discarded due to the evaporation
                  of a large amount of solvent (such as toluene) during the
                  operation. Cold lining, using the Mehra system, was just as
                  risky for the large amount of butyl acetate (or similar
                  solvent) needed to reactivate Plextol.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                  Using a thermoplastic adhesive in aqueous dispersion appeared
                  to be a good solution to avoid the use of a fair amount of
                  solvent, with its attendant risks of toxicity and fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A study focused on testing different adhesives obtained by
                  mixing Plextol B500 and Dispersion K360,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  in different proportions, was carried out to obtain a final
                  mixture to be reactivated by heating. Empirical tests were
                  performed to define the approximate reactivation temperature
                  and the reversibility of each mixture ([[Orata and Capellaro
                  2013]]|, 57–66) in order to identify the one that would better
                  fit the features and conservative conditions of the painting
                  (<strong>[table

                  acrylic-based class of adhesives very advantageous in devising
                  innovative solutions.

                  Samples 1 and 2 are tests on the two pure resins (see [<strong>table 11.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/table-11-2)).
                  Each mixture was sprayed on a polyester canvas mock-up. After
                  solvent evaporation, each was joined to a linen canvas mock-up
                  in order to simulate the real conditions of use. The mock-ups
                  were then placed in a vacuum bag and lined by increasing the
                  temperature incrementally starting at 40°C going up to 80°C,
                  applying a constant vacuum of 700 mbar. After each 10-degree
                  increase, the bag was opened, each mock-up was tested, and the
                  degree of adhesion was evaluated. Sample 4, composed of 30%
                  Dispersion K360 and 70% Plextol B500, reactivated between 60°C
                  and 70°C (shown in red in [<strong>table 11.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/table-11-2))
                  was the one that showed a good combination of adhesion and
                  reversibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This adhesive was sprayed on the stretched polyester
                  canvas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>
                  Particular attention was paid to maintaining the correct
                  tension of the lining canvas during the whole process. In
                  fact, during the reactivation of the thermoplastic adhesive,
                  the lining canvas was stretched again on the worktop to
                  maintain the orthogonal orientation of the warp and weft
                  threads and to avoid the transfer of undesirable tensions to
                  the painting during the final stretching phase. If the lining
                  canvas is not tensioned when applying the adhesive and when
                  the lining is adhered to the original canvas, its threads will
                  remain more extensible. When the lined painting is finally
                  stretched on the definitive stretcher, more tension would be
                  required to first stretch those loose threads, before
                  transferring tension to the whole lined support. This
                  excessive tension could result in damage to the original
                  canvas, which is usually less elastic than the new lining
                  canvas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before lining the painting facedown in the vacuum system, it
                  was necessary to fill the biggest losses with stucco, to avoid
                  the original canvas being pushed towards the paint surface,
                  where paint layers were missing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The adhesion of new canvas was carried out in a vacuum bag
                  (envelope), with the painting placed facedown on a worktop.
                  Nonwoven fabric<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>
                  was used as a cushioning layer, to preserve the thin
                  brushstrokes, keeping the seams on the back at the same time.
                  The adhesive was reactivated by placing 70°C water inside a
                  loom and treating circumscribed areas of about 1 square meter
                  using the tub system described earlier and outlined in
                  [<strong>fig. 11.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/fig-11-4).
                  To stretch the canvas on the final expandable stretcher, the
                  painting was positioned facedown to reduce the forces applied
                  at the edges.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not all the losses were filled and retouched, because the art
                  historian who directed the conservation treatment chose to
                  leave a historical memory of the flood of Florence. When the
                  treatment was finished, the painting was exhibited at the
                  Medici Chapels in Florence ([<strong>fig. 11.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/fig-11-5)).

                <p>
                  The methodologies described above are only some examples of
                  solutions outlined to solve specific conservation issues on
                  large-size paintings, but they represent the way we approach
                  the work, focusing on the artwork, which always has its own
                  requirements as a result of the properties of its original
                  materials and subsequent history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe that no best or worst methodology exists, but a
                  specific and suited intervention should be applied based on a
                  deep understanding of both the painting technique and the
                  conservation history of the artwork. A protocol of scientific
                  analysis helps to identify and quantify structural damages,
                  and then to decide, together with the experience gained with
                  practice, which conservation strategy is more appropriate to
                  solve the specific problem, regardless of tradition,
                  inclination, or current trends.

                        Elastic modulus is a measure of stiffness, defining the
                        relationship between stress and strain in a material.
                        The elastic modulus of the original canvas is usually
                        quite different than the modulus of the new lining
                        canvas. In our experience of tensioning new lining
                        canvases, we have found that new canvas (whether made of
                        natural or synthetic fibers) is usually more elastic
                        than the original.
