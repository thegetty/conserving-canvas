                  In 2019 Yale University, with the support of the Getty
                  Foundation, held an international conference, where nearly
                  four hundred attendees from more than twenty countries
                  gathered to discuss a vital topic: how best to conserve
                  paintings on canvas. It was the first major symposium on the
                  subject since 1974, when wax-resin and glue-paste lining
                  reigned as the predominant conservation techniques. Over the
                  past fifty years, such methods, which were often destructive
                  to artworks, have become less widely used in favor of more
                  minimalist approaches to intervention. More recent decades
                  have witnessed the reevaluation of traditional practices as
                  well as focused research supporting significant new
                  methodologies, procedures, and synthetic materials for the
                  care and conservation of paintings on fabric supports.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Conserving Canvas compiles the proceedings of the conference,
                  presenting a wide array of papers and posters that provide
                  important global perspectives on the history, current state,
                  and future needs of the field. Featuring an expansive glossary
                  of terms that will be an invaluable resource for conservators
                  and other practitioners, this publication promises to become a
                  standard reference for the international conservation
                  community.

                  We are delighted to present the proceedings of the October
                  2019 international symposium <em>Conserving Canvas</em>. Like
                  the Getty Foundation initiative carrying the same name, the
                  symposium focused on the structural care and conservation of
                  paintings on fabric supports. Organized by the Institute for
                  the Preservation of Cultural Heritage at Yale University, and
                  with support from the Yale University Art Gallery and Yale
                  Center for British Art, this momentous event gathered no less
                  than 370 conservators and conservation scientists from around
                  the globe on Yale’s campus in 2019 to discuss what was once a
                  heated topic in the field. Here we are referring to the method
                  of wax-resin lining that previously dominated in the field and
                  was heavily criticized and largely abandoned after the
                  legendary 1974 conference held at the National Maritime Museum
                  in Greenwich, England. At that conference, conservators
                  ushered in an era of new approaches, alternative procedures,
                  and novel synthetic materials. The 2019 Yale conference was
                  the first major international gathering on the subject since
                  1974, allowing specialists to look back on more than
                  forty-five years of practice and take stock of the current
                  state of the field. Thanks to the symposium organizers,
                  professionals from India to Argentina, from Scotland to South
                  Africa met each other and exchanged ideas, setting new
                  standards for international inclusion in the field. We extend
                  special recognition and thanks to the organizers and advisors
                  who worked hard to make this experience so valuable for so
                  many: Ian McClure, Elizabeth Williams, Cynthia Schwarz, Mikkel
                  Scharf, Christina Young, Alan Phenix, and Jim Coddington.

                  The care and conservation of paintings on canvas is an ongoing
                  concern for museums around the world. Ever since the 1974
                  Greenwich conference, many conservators have shied away from
                  structural repairs perceived as being too invasive. In many
                  cases this led to unintended consequences, with new
                  generations of conservators possessing little to no practical
                  experience with structural treatments. To address this
                  knowledge gap, the Getty Foundation in 2018 launched the
                  Conserving Canvas grant initiative, which to date has
                  supported twenty-six projects involving conservators and other
                  specialists from more than three dozen countries. The
                  Conserving Canvas initiative is ensuring that conservators
                  remain fully informed about how to preserve these important
                  works of art through support for training activities,
                  scientific research, and information sharing.&nbsp;The Yale
                  conference was a crucial launching pad for this work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As you will read in this volume, presenters at the
                  <em>Conserving Canvas</em> symposium addressed historical
                  approaches to the treatment of canvas paintings; highlighted
                  current methods, materials, and research; and pointed to the
                  growing challenges associated with the structural conservation
                  of modern and contemporary works. While the record indicates
                  that the atmosphere at the Greenwich conference was quite
                  contentious, the Yale conference could not have been more
                  collegial. Productive dialogue and discussion proved how much
                  the field has developed in the last four decades, and the
                  energy and enthusiasm generated among participants was
                  positively electric. Over four days the presenters shared
                  diverse views and approaches, which prompted frank and
                  in-depth conversations. The forty papers and twenty-three
                  posters presented in these proceedings reflect that quality
                  and diversity.

                  The symposium held at Yale in October 2019 grew out of the
                  Getty Foundation’s Conserving Canvas initiative, which,
                  through a combination of practical workshops, publications and
                  research support, and expert meetings, aims to evaluate and
                  foster the structural treatment of paintings on canvas (<a href="#fig-0-1"><strong>fig. 0.1</strong></a>). The symposium was planned with the 1974 Greenwich
                  Conference on Comparative Lining Techniques,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  the last international conference to be held on this subject,
                  very much in mind. In 1974, conservators from institutions and
                  in private practice demonstrated a wide range of techniques,
                  both innovative and traditional, and in doing so raised some
                  fundamental questions that are still central to our thinking
                  and decision-making process in planning structural treatments.
                  In the forty-five years since, however, the options for lining
                  and alternatives to lining have expanded. The new options are
                  drawn from a variety of sources: advances in the materials
                  industry, with the production of synthetic adhesives and
                  textiles and the introduction of nanotechnology; new research
                  into the mechanical behavior of laminate structures; and the
                  resourcefulness of conservators who approach their work with
                  innovation. Concerns at the forefront of the field in 2019
                  also included environmental sustainability and a heightened
                  awareness of the benefits of a global perspective on painting
                  conservation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The timeliness of the Conserving Canvas initiative and the
                  conference is clear. In the planning stages, it was thought
                  the sessions would be held on Yale’s West Campus, where the
                  conservation studios and Institute for Preservation of
                  Cultural Heritage are located. High demand quickly dictated a
                  move to the more spacious auditorium at the Yale Art Gallery,
                  which filled to capacity. The auditorium was filled with over
                  370 attendees from more than twenty-five countries, likely the
                  largest gathering of painting conservators ever convened (<a href="#fig-0-2"><strong>fig. 0.2</strong></a>). This interest in the topic was also mirrored in the
                  international response in papers presented by conservators who
                  represented more than twenty countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The impact of the postprints of the 1974 conference was even
                  greater than the conference itself, as they not only presented
                  to a much wider audience the different approaches introduced
                  there, but also questioned previously held assumptions. While
                  the conference provided the opportunity for conservators to
                  compare lining techniques, with a focus on practical
                  workshops, the necessity of lining as a preservation measure
                  was ultimately called into question. For many, the most
                  perceptive and significant paper was the opening presentation
                  by Westby Percival-Prescott, “The Lining Cycle,” in which he
                  demonstrated how artists’ techniques of a certain period would
                  affect the response of those paintings to particular lining
                  practices at the time, usually evident many years later when
                  those paintings were deemed to require lining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Percival-Prescott’s paper, after reviewing different lining
                  techniques, called for research into methods that might
                  prevent the necessity of lining (see
                  <a href="#paper-42">Stoner</a> in this publication). In effect,
                  a call for historical research and a minimalist approach were
                  made.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With this context in mind, the call for papers for this
                  symposium made in September 2018 announced, “The symposium
                  will address historical approaches to and theories of the
                  structural conservation of canvas paintings; current methods,
                  materials and research, both practical and scientific; and the
                  challenges facing the structural conservation of modern and
                  contemporary works.” This reflected, in the view of the
                  Advisory Committee,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  developments and concerns in the structural treatment of works
                  on canvas today. The response to the call for papers was much
                  larger than expected and the proposals submitted guided the
                  committee to choose the sections laid out in these postprints.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While Percival-Prescott’s paper was unique in providing an
                  historical review in 1974, in the 2019 symposium historical
                  research played a very significant role. The recent research
                  into contemporary documentary sources, discussed in
                  contributions by <a href="#paper-5">Angela Cerasuolo</a>,
                  <a href="#paper-10">Matteo Rossi-Doria</a>, and
                  <a href="#paper-18">Ana Calvo et al.</a>, attest to considered
                  practices dating back to the eighteenth century and before. In
                  many cases written sources can be linked to surviving
                  treatments, often demonstrating the unexpected longevity of
                  linings carried out with natural materials. A strong case is
                  made for the use of natural materials—both for their low
                  toxicity and their performance over time. On the other hand,
                  assumptions about the stabilizing hydrophobic attributes of
                  wax-resin treatments were called into question by new
                  research, as can be seen, for example, in the work by [Emilie
                  Froment](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/paper-46).
                  A divide on seeking flexibility (as in mist lining) or
                  rigidity (as demonstrated in
                  <a href="#paper-22">Lynne Harrison’s paper</a>) in a lining or
                  lining system emerged, which also represented the trends of
                  research on lining procedures, and the mechanical behavior of
                  the composite structure of paintings since the Greenwich
                  Lining Conference. The fact that many of the practical and
                  philosophical divides in structural practices still fall along
                  geographic lines speaks to the sustained, deep roots in
                  historic treatment practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another theme that emerged at the conference was an emphasis
                  on the history and treatment of collections as a whole, as
                  well as forward-looking preventive care of collections. Here,
                  too, the role of past and ongoing research was evident,
                  although perhaps not always carried over into practice.
                  Increased levels of documentation also allow for the
                  examination and analysis of more data, mostly focused on
                  collections and their treatment histories. The greater
                  attention to documentation has enabled reviews of
                  institutional practice—which, when the data is extensive
                  enough, reveals trends, as evidenced in the contributions by
                  <a href="#paper-34">Nicola Costaras</a> and [Lauren Bradley and
                  Josh
                  Summer](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/paper-42).
                  A series of case studies covered the treatment of works large
                  and small and highlighted the significant attention paid to
                  local interventions, which demonstrate conservation’s
                  continuing ability to adopt and adapt existing techniques and
                  equipment from other fields, such as textile conservation,
                  imaging technology, and mechanical engineering. Papers
                  included research using samples of significant natural aging
                  and showed the ongoing embrace of new materials—both from
                  other fields and those specifically developed for
                  conservation. The audience was introduced to
                  <a href="#paper-30">Flock and Demuth’s “Winnie”</a> for the
                  application of glue in tear mends, for example, as well as the
                  adhesive meshes developed by
                  <a href="#paper-28">Mona Konietzny et al.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Threaded through all of these topics at the conference was the
                  ongoing question of definitions, of finding a common
                  vocabulary to describe—with as much precision and accuracy as
                  possible—what conservators see and do. This is especially
                  critical in order to exchange philosophies, methodologies, and
                  techniques with an international community that has grown out
                  of a variety of historic traditions and practice in vastly
                  different climates. To that end, we have included a
                  <a href="#glossary">glossary</a> based on the one published in
                  the 1974 preprints. Terms no longer in use have been deleted
                  and terms that have become current have been added. It is our
                  hope that this revised glossary reflects developments since
                  1974 while also attempting to define terms that can be used
                  universally. Finally, around the margins, but clearly moving
                  to a central position, is the question of sustainability, in
                  all its various forms. Indeed here is a term in need of
                  definition and common understanding.

                  One part of the conference that is not available to the reader
                  of these proceedings is the day devoted to practical
                  demonstrations—“sandbox sessions” that provided the
                  opportunity for experiential learning (<a href="#fig-0-3"><strong>fig. 0.3</strong></a>). Expert contributors led sessions on historic
                  reconstructions, innovative tools and equipment, hands-on
                  mechanical demonstrations, and localized tear mending. It is
                  the continued refinement of established practice, as well as
                  development of new, more effective practices, that these
                  sessions represent, and to which we believe these proceedings
                  will be an ongoing contribution.

                  None of this would have been possible without the support of a
                  large network of our generous, capable colleagues. First,
                  thanks are owed to the rest of the symposium Advisory
                  Committee: Alan Phenix, Mikkel Scharff, Anton Wilmering, and
                  Christina Young. At Getty, thanks also to Joan Weinstein and
                  Allison Reilly. At Yale, thanks go out to Stephanie Wiles;
                  Henry J. Heinz II, director of the Yale University Art
                  Gallery; and Courtney Martin, director of the Yale Center for
                  British Art, for their support, contribution of space and
                  resources to the symposium, and hospitality shown to the
                  participants. The conference would not have been possible
                  without the ongoing efforts of Laurie Batza, Beth Bolen, and
                  Elizabeth Williams at the Yale Institute for the Preservation
                  of Cultural Heritage. Also thanks to the Yale Conferences and
                  Events staff, especially Shannon LeGault, who arranged two
                  meals a day and warm welcomes for our 370 participants. The
                  Avangrid Foundation provided critical funding support for
                  presenters and attendees from Spain, and our special thanks go
                  to Nicole Licata Grant. The program books were designed by
                  Stephanie Bedoya with the assistance of Yale University Art
                  Gallery designer Chris Sleboda, who also designed the tote
                  bags for the participants. Advertising support from Willard
                  Conservation Products, Everett Fine Art, and Getty
                  Publications made the program books possible. At the Yale
                  University Art Gallery, thanks are owed to Molleen Theodore,
                  Liz Harnett, Mark Paturzo, and Roksana Filipowska. Many Yale
                  University conservators, conservation fellows, and interns
                  contributed to the success of the symposium, from hosting
                  guests and providing directions to assisting in sandbox
                  sessions and hanging posters, and to too many other supportive
                  roles to mention. Our deep thanks for this to Irma Passeri,
                  Kelsey Wingel, Mark Aronson, Jessica David, Anne Gunnison,
                  Olav Bjornerud, and Beth Godcher. We hope that this
                  publication will be of great value to the international
                  conservation community for years to come.

                        Many of these effects changed the appearance of the
                        paintings. These changes to the structure, topography,
                        and other attributes of the painting have been described
                        in various ways in the conservation literature. Most
                        importantly, though, a consensus emerged that these
                        changes compromised the aesthetic integrity of the
                        painting, bringing aesthetic discussions of the surfaces
                        of paintings to the fore as well as discussion of
                        technical matters.

                  In the latter part of the twentieth century, conservators
                  questioned the practice of lining paintings on canvas. This
                  inspired fundamental scientific studies of the structure,
                  material, and aging of paintings. The implications of
                  mechanical and chemical aging can now be better predicted.
                  This knowledge has provided conservators with a wide choice of
                  alternative treatments, and it supports the concept of
                  collections care.

                  Structural Conservation
                </h2>
                <p>
                  By addressing the structure of a painting, we are forced to
                  consider not only the image intended by the artist but also
                  the artwork’s physical nature and history. A stretched canvas
                  is a subtle and delicate construction devised for both
                  stability and lightness, but if the structure is damaged or
                  failing, this creates risks for both the appearance and
                  purpose of a painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As any artifact ages and deteriorates, it eventually reaches a
                  point when its appearance and functions are judged no longer
                  acceptable. Some of these changes demand action in order to
                  preserve the artifact’s use and prevent further decay. Some
                  changes are not reversible—for instance, cracks, which
                  indicate fragility and may also cause a disturbing
                  interference with an image. Yet, for a painting, cracks are
                  also viewed as a sign of authenticity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Structural conservation of a canvas painting can be a more
                  profound intervention than cleaning or varnish removal, and
                  each intervention presents fundamental aesthetic challenges
                  for the paint surface and ethical doubts for the concept of
                  reversibility. A structural treatment may be applied to an
                  entire painting, perhaps in a single rapid operation. Like
                  other aspects of conservation, such a treatment requires
                  considerable judgment and skill, and success is often judged
                  by its invisibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fifty years ago, a traditional lining method was considered a
                  normal component of any conservation treatment. The lining
                  used was defined by the choice of adhesive, and these
                  materials had a surprisingly wide range of properties, from
                  water based to water repellent. The goal of lining was to turn
                  a fragile canvas painting into one that was much more
                  resilient, but the means and the outcome were not well
                  defined. The dangers in lining were recognized, however, and
                  it was normally carried out by skilled and experienced
                  professionals. But attempts were also made to automate and
                  deskill the process by using hot tables and vacuum pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the student, there was little published information except
                  for some early discussions on reservations about glue lining,
                  the justification for introducing wax-resin adhesives, and
                  designs for hot tables ([[Ruhemann 1953]]; [[Straub and
                  Rees-Jones 1955]]). From this background, W. Percival-Prescott
                  conceived the Conference on Comparative Lining Techniques,
                  held in Greenwich (London) in 1974. This ambitious project
                  brought together experts from various backgrounds, but it
                  succeeded in uncovering much confusion of purpose and also a
                  genuine desire to improve the situation ([[Percival-Prescott
                  2003b]]). Traditional methods were described by practitioners,
                  and several research projects investigating alternative
                  adhesives and lining methods were presented. A wide variety of
                  conservation aims emerged, from restoring the original
                  appearance of a painting to accepting its existing condition
                  ([[Mehra 2003]]). For the first time, the advantages and
                  disadvantages of all materials and methods were openly
                  debated, including wax lining methods ([[Berger and Zeliger
                  2003]]; [[Cummings and Hedley 2003]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  During a period when lining was widely, uncritically accepted,
                  most practitioners had a limited range of experience and had
                  honed their skills in a narrow lining specialty based on one
                  specific adhesive. The establishment of conservation training
                  courses with academic aspirations has now largely replaced the
                  former apprenticeship training, which passed on the strengths
                  and skills of existing practices but had no mechanism to
                  compare or improve on them. Formal training has provided
                  impetus for conservation science, and the study of
                  conservation methods has influenced the materials and practice
                  of conservators, and even some artists.

                  After Greenwich, it was clear that an understanding of the
                  structure and mechanisms of stretched canvas paintings was
                  needed. This has since been achieved by a number of
                  researchers, beginning with Marion Mecklenburg and his
                  systematic studies that provided measurements of painting
                  materials under tension and in different RH conditions,
                  identifying the high tension in glue films and grounds at low
                  humidity. Measurements of breaking strains of oil paint films
                  led to an explanation of the observed cracking of canvas
                  paintings ([<strong>fig. 1.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-1)).

                  The response of paintings to moisture had been a particular
                  concern since the nineteenth century. Mecklenburg’s plot of
                  tension against RH for all the materials on a stretched and
                  primed canvas was a major advance ([[Mecklenburg 1982]];
                  [[Mecklenburg and Tumosa 1991a]]). Gerry Hedley explained the
                  mechanism of canvas shrinking when exposed to water or RH
                  approaching 100%. He also saw the effect of initial weave
                  crimp transfer from warp to weft ([[Hedley 1993]]; [[Hedley
                  and Odlyha 1993]]). The differing influence of pigments on the
                  drying (curing) of linseed oil explained why the application
                  of moisture and pressure is not enough to flatten most mature
                  lead white paints. Temperature response of paintings was also
                  investigated ([[Michalski 1991]]). Cracking of otherwise
                  flexible acrylic paintings at extremely low temperatures was
                  at first surprising. The concept of glass transition
                  temperature (Tg) clarified why familiar flexible materials
                  became brittle at these low temperatures.

                  Long-term mechanical behavior, such as relaxation and creep,
                  have also been measured, providing useful predictions of
                  future behavior. It took sixteen years to collect the data
                  shown in [<strong>fig. 1.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-2)
                  at the Canadian Conservation Institute, which shows the
                  relaxation (loss of tension) of stretched canvas paintings and
                  linings over that period of time, plotted on a logarithmic
                  time axis. Such data is critical when deciding on the best
                  choice of adhesive and lining material.

                  The use of biaxial stretching, first proposed by Berger
                  ({Berger and Russell 2000}), and electronic speckle pattern
                  interferometry (ESPI) for strain measurement ([<strong>fig. 1.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-3))
                  enabled Young and Hibberd to look in further detail at
                  conservation issues and lining practice, such as the strain
                  associated with stretcher attachments ([[Young and Hibberd
                  1999]]; [[Young and Hibberd 2000]]). The complex structure of
                  stretched canvas is now understood in sufficient detail to
                  consider computer modeling of the mechanical properties of
                  both paintings and linings. It also offers the opportunity to
                  study in more detail the effects of minimal treatments on more
                  contemporary paintings ([[Hagan et al. 2007]]; [[Hagan et al.
                  2011]]). Temporary solutions and physical protection may prove
                  to be our best options, but many have not yet been fully
                  assessed objectively.

                <p>
                  Transferring research results into conservation practice on
                  historic objects involves special problems. Understanding
                  materials in a pristine state is not enough to predict the
                  behavior of deteriorated old paintings ([[Ackroyd 2002]];
                  [[Hackney 2004b]]; [[Phenix 1995]]; [[Reeve 1984]]; [[Scharff
                  2012]]). Since an assessment of physical condition and
                  appropriate treatment requires such knowledge, measuring slow
                  processes, such as “natural” aging, is increasingly necessary
                  in order to make reliable long-term decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Progress in devising and applying new conservation treatments
                  is made difficult because at some stage practical experience
                  can be gained only by working directly on unique and valuable
                  original aged material ([<strong>fig. 1.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-4)).
                  It might be argued that this amounts to carrying out
                  scientific experiments lacking a control. As a consequence, we
                  can choose our treatment method but cannot be sure it was the
                  best of several possible options.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the UK, original nineteenth-century loose linings have
                  provided a limited source of acceptable experimental material,
                  but such material has still not been replicated reliably in
                  all its aspects by artificial aging methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the conservator concerned with historic paintings, it is
                  important to be aware of artists’ changing methods, materials,
                  and intentions. There is much detail, accumulated from the
                  examination of examples of painting practice, to inform the
                  conservator of the likely behavior of a specific painting to
                  be treated. For the period from the latter part of the
                  nineteenth century until the present, artists were less bound
                  by academy controls; their aims became more adventurous, and
                  their materials and methods expanded. As paintings from this
                  period increasingly demand attention and treatment, the
                  conservator is presented with a variety of interesting new
                  problems and conflicts, many of which have already contributed
                  to modified conservation practice for works on canvas,
                  currently leading to a more preventive approach. The demands
                  of much recently created art provide a challenge that requires
                  radical solutions, and they are pointing to new directions in
                  conservation of both contemporary and traditional art
                  ([[Heiber 2003]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some developments of lining processes using new materials,
                  such as sailcloth fabric ([[Hedley and Villers 1982]]) and
                  Beva 371 adhesive ([[Berger 1975]]), have so far survived the
                  test of time. Exploring the properties and stability of
                  possible alternative conservation structural materials is a
                  major undertaking, made more difficult by the risk that
                  material manufacturers may discontinue their supply. Economics
                  also conspire to deter time-consuming structural treatments.
                  As a consequence, for many contemporary paintings, restoration
                  often challenges existing experience and costs much more than
                  preventing damage ([<strong>fig. 1.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-5)).

                <p>
                  Given the many unavoidable problems encountered in
                  conservation treatments, protecting canvases from physical and
                  chemical deterioration is now considered a priority in many
                  museums. For the conservator, it has always been difficult to
                  predict the range of conditions to which a painting has been
                  and could be exposed. The environment that a specific painting
                  is likely to encounter remains uncertain, even within museums.
                  Increasingly, we ask what are the true risks for paintings on
                  canvas and how should we decide when intervention is
                  necessary?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Improvements in the environment of modern museums (controlled
                  and filtered air conditioning, UV filtration); careful
                  handling and operating procedures; and protection during
                  transport and handling have all contributed to more reliable
                  conditions. Defining exact relative humidity/temperature
                  (RH/T) conditions is virtually impossible, but the absence of
                  identifiable damage that can be directly attributed to current
                  museum conditions is a positive indicator. However, more
                  recently, an open-ended commitment to long-term protection by
                  air-conditioning has been challenged as expensive and
                  unsustainable in energy terms.

                  In the past, the risks of travel were unpredictable and
                  thought to be large. Conservators were therefore obliged to
                  reinforce a painting’s structure to the best of their powers.
                  With increasing loan and exhibition programs and major
                  blockbuster exhibitions, this has become an international
                  problem. The transport environment has now been examined in
                  terms of shock, vibration, moisture content, and temperature
                  along with their consequences for paintings in transit.
                  Criteria for behavior and designs for packing cases to
                  minimize exposure to risks have become established. An
                  interesting observation from the Art in Transit research group
                  was that, by using reliable methods and tight procedures,
                  transport risks could be reduced below those of handling
                  within a museum ([[Mecklenburg 1991]]).

                  By introducing consistent procedures for the physical
                  protection of works of art, it is easier to avoid much
                  accidental damage and unnecessary early deterioration.
                  Successful collections care procedures have together made the
                  idea that lining is a requirement much less persuasive and
                  forced us to be more precise about its purpose.

                  For the long-term survival of paintings, the less dramatic yet
                  equally important chemical degradation of canvas, size,
                  ground, and paint needs to be considered. However, the exact
                  condition of aged canvases and their continuing rate of decay
                  cannot be known in sufficient detail and are not readily
                  captured in most risk analysis, which is currently concerned
                  with shorter term, mainly physical activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The slow reactions of oxidation and hydrolysis that take place
                  in degrading cellulose and oil paint are the main reasons that
                  painting materials become fragile. What were originally stable
                  structures no longer perform their design function, and
                  physical damage often follows. Air pollution and light
                  contribute to this deterioration, involving chemical
                  interactions between canvas and its immediate environment.
                  They play a subtle, perhaps unstoppable, role in aging.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the period between 1900 and 1960, air pollution was at its
                  worst in many countries. Most museums were not
                  air-conditioned, and until about 1990 concentrations of
                  particulates and the strong acidic gas sulfur dioxide remained
                  unacceptably high. In the last hundred years or so, exposed
                  canvas has adsorbed sulfur dioxide from air pollution; the
                  sulfur dioxide then reacts with the cellulose in the canvas.
                  The products are not volatile and remain in the canvas,
                  facilitating hydrolysis reactions. All acidity, whether from
                  external and internal pollution or simply from oxidation,
                  cause measurable weakening and embrittlement of the canvas
                  ([<strong>fig. 1.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/17100-Conserving-Canvas-S23-Quire-GCI/TRANSMITTAL/papers/fig-1-6)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Efflorescence can occur on the surface of oil paintings,
                  especially unvarnished ones, and sometimes, on glazed works,
                  it is transferred onto the glass. This deposit has been
                  analyzed as fatty acids ([[Williams 1989]]), and these fatty
                  acids must have been released from the oil paint. The
                  hydrolysis of oils is well known, and migration of its
                  reaction products within dried oil paint films explains
                  efflorescence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There has been a major advance in understanding the
                  degradation of oil paint and how it changes the paint’s
                  optical performance and our perception of a painted image
                  ([[Boon, Van der Weerd, and Keune 2002]]; [[Keune 2005]]). We
                  are all familiar with the increase in transparency of oil
                  paintings and grounds. The impregnation and lining of
                  paintings with thin grounds can cause increases in
                  transparency, especially when wax resin has been used
                  ([[Bomford and Staniforth 1981]]). We now know that old paint
                  films form an ionomeric structure that continues to
                  deteriorate by hydrolysis and oxidation. Saponification
                  reactions of free acids with alkaline or basic metals present
                  in finer pigments, such as calcium, magnesium, lead, and zinc,
                  can dissolve pigments into the paint. Removal of these
                  light-dispersing pigments causes the paint to increase in
                  transparency.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I recently made some experiments involving mixing acid-base
                  titration indicators into various fresh white oil paints and
                  then painting them out. In a few minutes, the pH 4, 4.1, and
                  4.7 indicators began to change color, but the pH 3.3 and 3.7
                  indicators remained unchanged for months. For comparison,
                  samples were removed and exposed to ammonia vapor to return
                  them to their initial color (for a short time). Similar
                  control samples in artists acrylic paint did not change color
                  at all. This demonstrates that oil paint becomes acidic within
                  a short period of time ([[Hackney 2020]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The acidic nature of dried oil paint is the reason why artists
                  do not paint directly on canvas but instead protect it with a
                  coat of glue size. The application of an oil ground or paint
                  on top of this water-soluble size layer produces many of the
                  structural and mechanical problems that we have to deal with.
                  A hot glue size will engulf the canvas, but when applied cold
                  it can accumulate on the canvas surface ([[Morgan et al.
                  2012]]). If and when a glue size cracks, its barrier
                  properties are reduced and volatile breakdown products (VOCs)
                  may reach the canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Similarly, if we add a consolidating or lining adhesive that
                  can become acidic on oxidation, the canvas will be exposed to
                  more rapid deterioration. These arguments suggest more
                  research is needed into both conservation adhesives and ways
                  of achieving adequate deacidification of canvas ([[Hackney,
                  Townsend, and Wyplosz 1996]]; [[Ryder 1986]]).

                  The concentration in air is not in itself a measure of
                  reaction rate, but it shows that more molecules are available
                  to react. Below 0.5 AER (air exchange rate), the rate of
                  off-gassing of acetic acid, both from the packaging and (some)
                  from the object, exceeds the combined leakage rate and rate of
                  deposition or reaction, the latter being slow processes. When
                  reactive molecules collide, only a small proportion react, but
                  in these circumstances trapped pollution molecules can collide
                  many times and will eventually react. The introduction of
                  sacrificial adsorbers or reactants might therefore be useful,
                  provided they are placed close to the object.

                  There is still plenty to do, but at last we know that we can
                  build on a growing body of knowledge. We still need to turn
                  this knowledge resource into genuine expertise and practical
                  conservation experience. We also need to embed in our minds
                  the concept of preventing deterioration, which will be
                  appreciated by future practitioners who will be still
                  addressing the same ethical issues. The Conserving Canvas
                  symposium provided a useful forum to take stock of recent
                  progress and to assess its contribution to the development of
                  an agreed way forward.

                  Paintings on canvas are composite structures with mechanical
                  properties that are difficult to characterize due to many
                  complicating issues: the wide range of artist materials and
                  techniques, which vary by region and time; the changing
                  properties of materials with age and environmental exposure;
                  and the addition of conservation treatments. Paintings are
                  also composed of viscoelastic materials, which means that
                  properties such as stiffness and extensibility are time and
                  temperature dependent. This large matrix of variables makes it
                  impossible to characterize the behavior of all paintings in
                  the same way that an engineer might describe a distinct
                  structure under a narrow window of conditions and boundary
                  constraints. Valuable information is instead derived from
                  materials testing of representative samples, development of
                  simplified models, and expert knowledge from past successes
                  and failures. As a result of the complexity, heuristics is
                  often applied in conservation treatments. This paper provides
                  a generalized overview of the mechanical behavior of paintings
                  in tension and describes trends that help to refine the
                  heuristics approach. The discussion is presented in the
                  context of a viscoelastic (time-dependent) material model
                  rather than elastic-plastic in order to highlight key
                  concepts.

                <p>
                  Those studying the mechanical behavior of artist paints and
                  painting structures will likely begin with the general
                  elastic-plastic stress-strain relationships often discussed in
                  introductory engineering texts. A classic diagram will label
                  elastic modulus, yield point, ultimate tensile strength, and
                  failure strain from a simple tensile test. The concepts then
                  become incredibly complex when delving deeper into the
                  response of polymeric materials under varying conditions. This
                  is particularly true for artists paints when considering the
                  influence of temperature, rate of deformation, moisture
                  content, additives to the polymer matrix, and many other
                  factors. To accurately characterize the small-strain behavior
                  of paint films over a wide range of conditions, it often
                  necessary to consider a linear viscoelastic material model
                  ([[Ferry 1980]]). Describing the large-strain response may
                  require adding hyperelasticity ([[Treloar 1975]]) for an
                  extension to a nonlinear viscoelastic material ([[Christensen
                  1982]]). An example of this approach was developed for acrylic
                  (latex) artists paints containing titanium dioxide ([[Hagan et
                  al. 2009]]), which provided parameters for finite element
                  analysis in software such as Abaqus. Calibrating such a
                  model—even for one material—is no easy task. It involves many
                  tests and numerical iteration to solve the best fit parameters
                  to experimental data, and simplifying assumptions still
                  remain.

                  When pigment particles are included in the polymer matrix of a
                  paint film the material becomes a particle-filled composite
                  with a viscoelastic matrix. Stiffness enhancement as a
                  function of particle volume concentration is described in many
                  micromechanics models; however, most give little consideration
                  to geometry effects. The Mori-Tanaka theory is particularly
                  useful since it considers the influence of particle shape and
                  orientation in addition to volume fraction ([[Tandon and Weng
                  1986]]). Clements and Mas extended this theory from an elastic
                  to linear viscoelastic matrix for small-strain modeling
                  ([[Clements and Mas 2001]]). The effects of particle shape and
                  concentration were highlighted for artists acrylic paints
                  using kaolin, calcium carbonate (aragonite), and titanium
                  dioxide as an inorganic phase in a recent study ([[Hagan et
                  al. 2011a]]). From this research, it is easy to imagine that
                  the properties of a paint layer may be different along a
                  brushstroke relative to the transverse direction, due to the
                  alignment of pigment particles with an aspect ratio not equal
                  to 1. The composite structure of a painting on canvas adds
                  further complexity given the layering of different materials
                  and boundary conditions at the stretcher. Common treatment
                  approaches, such as linings, add further variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is impractical to think that we can precisely understand
                  the mechanical behavior of paintings with so many influencing
                  factors, which additionally include chemical effects of the
                  aging process, the physical aging of polymers ([[Struik
                  1980]]), load cycling, fracture, and delamination
                  ([[Tantideeravit et al. 2013]]). While researchers work to
                  better understand and model these materials for risk analysis,
                  it is important to use the best information available in a
                  heuristic approach to resolving practical problems of the
                  moment. Waller and Michalski emphasized the value of
                  heuristics in preventative conservation:
                </p>
                <p>
                  A fully rational approach would require that all possibly
                  relevant information be obtained and used in arriving at a
                  decision or evaluation. The cost of—and time required for—a
                  fully rational decision is infinite. Instead, a conservator
                  evaluates, using heuristics (simple rules of thumb or
                  intuition), whether there is an advantage in seeking more
                  information before deciding whether a particular issue, such
                  as a risk to a collection, is significant or not. ([[Waller
                  and Michalski 2004, 6]])

                <p>
                  In “Toward a Definition of the Engineering Method,” Koen
                  defines <em>heuristics</em> as “anything that provides a
                  plausible aid or direction in the solution of a problem but is
                  in the final analysis unjustified, incapable of justification
                  and fallible. It is anything that is used to guide, discover
                  and reveal a possible, but not necessarily, correct way to
                  solve a problem” ([[Koen 1988, 308]]). An important comparison
                  is given to the different approaches of the scientific and
                  engineering methods. Koen also states that “the engineering
                  method is the use of engineering heuristics to cause the best
                  change in a poorly understood situation within the available
                  resources” ([[Koen 1988, 308]]). There is clearly a similarity
                  between the work of a heritage conservation professional and
                  an engineer, with respect to problem-solving under challenging
                  circumstances with many unknowns.

                  A pertinent example of the engineering method is found in the
                  renowned body of research by Mecklenburg related to the
                  mechanics of artist materials and the effects of the museum
                  environment. In the proceedings of the 1991 Art in Transit
                  meeting, Mecklenburg and Tumosa present findings that
                  highlight the tensile properties of artists paints as a
                  function of strain rate ([[Mecklenburg and Tumosa 1991]]). In
                  contrast, subsequent research gives descriptions of material
                  behavior that use an elastic-plastic (time-independent) model
                  ([[Mecklenburg 2005]]). Strain rate is fixed to a constant
                  value in mechanical tests to generate timely and practical
                  information on the effects of the museum environment without
                  the burden of viscoelastic theory.

                <p>
                  The aim of this paper is to revisit some key concepts in the
                  time-dependent mechanical behavior of paintings, as a
                  supplement to fundamental knowledge of mechanics. The concepts
                  relate to many of the treatment methods used in practice where
                  material behavior is altered by changing different parameters.
                  Detailed theory and test results are presented elsewhere;
                  therefore, focus is given to generalized trends for clarity. A
                  brief review of lining effects on stiffness and stress
                  relaxation of painting is also provided to complement a more
                  in-depth discussion regarding the Canadian Conservation
                  Institute (CCI) Lining Project ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]).

                  <em>Stress-strain curves</em>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  A stress-strain curve is derived from a simple tensile test,
                  and it is often used to characterize the mechanical properties
                  of painting materials. Force and displacement measurements are
                  converted to stress and strain in order to remove the effects
                  of sample geometry. The initial slope of a stress-strain curve
                  in uniaxial tension is a measure of stiffness called the
                  modulus of elasticity, <em>E</em>, or Young’s modulus.
                  Experiments in shear mode define the shear modulus, while
                  hydrostatic pressure gives the bulk modulus. For a
                  viscoelastic material, these elastic moduli are time
                  dependent, and the stress-strain relationship is nonlinear due
                  to polymer relaxation during the test.
                  <a href="#fig-2-1"><strong>Fig. 2.1</strong></a> shows
                  stress-strain curves from a series of tensile tests performed
                  on free films of an artist’s oil paint. The results highlight
                  that the modulus decreases with higher temperature and reduced
                  rate of deformation, while the failure strain increases.
                  Despite this trend, there is no simple relationship between
                  stiffness and failure strain for materials in general. A
                  material may be stiff and brittle or compliant and brittle.

                <p>
                  <a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>Fig. 2.2</strong></a> illustrates
                  the results of a tensile test with the time dimension added.
                  The first graph (<a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>fig. 2.2a</strong></a>) shows the strain history as millistrain versus time, and
                  indicates that the strain rate, <em>R</em>, is constant during
                  the constant speed test due to the low failure strain. At
                  higher strains, the strain rate would measurably decrease
                  during a constant speed test due to the changing length of the
                  sample. The second graph (<a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>fig. 2.2b</strong></a>) gives stress versus time, and the third (<a href="#fig-2-2"><strong>fig. 2.2c</strong></a>) presents a stress-strain curve. The latter shows a secant
                  modulus, <em>E~s~</em> (at strain ε&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.005), and the strain
                  at failure ε~f~. Secant modulus can be a useful measure of
                  stiffness due to nonlinearity caused by relaxation during the
                  tensile test.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  A relaxation test is another useful experiment for studying
                  time-dependent material properties, and it is particularly
                  relevant to canvas-supported paintings.
                  <a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>Fig. 2.3</strong></a> illustrates
                  the different parameters in a stress-relaxation test performed
                  on a Winsor and Newton Foundation White film. The first graph
                  (<a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>fig. 2.3a</strong></a>) shows the strain history as an initial loading ramp,
                  followed by constant strain during measurement of stress
                  relaxation. The second (<a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>fig. 2.3b</strong></a>) shows the loading ramp on a stress-strain curve, and a
                  vertical drop in stress during the constant strain segment.
                  <strong><a href="#fig-2-3">Fig. 2.3c</a></strong> gives the
                  stress relaxation process on a plot of stress versus time,
                  where it appears that stress is approaching equilibration
                  after a sharp initial drop. The final plot (<a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>fig. 2.3d</strong></a>) shows the same data on a log-log scale, and highlights that
                  the sample is still relaxing. The results also show similar
                  findings for a repeat test that was performed on the same
                  sample after a twenty-four-hour recovery period. During cyclic
                  load testing on viscoelastic materials, it is important to
                  consider strain history and its effects on repeated
                  measurements.

                  of tension (kN/m) versus time after a fixed strain was applied
                  to each sample ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]). The initial
                  sharp spike is caused by the rapid initial strain (see
                  <a href="#fig-2-3"><strong>figs. 2.3b and c</strong></a>), which is followed by a quick decay in tension due to
                  stress relaxation. The model painting with a linen lining
                  shows no difference from the model painting (unlined) over the
                  measurement time scale. The sailcloth lining causes a uniform
                  vertical shift in tension due to the stiffness of the fabric,
                  which is constant over the sixty-hour period. An advantage of
                  the sailcloth lining is that its stiffness allows for a stable
                  increase in tension, with less strain imposed on the painting.
                  In fact, the strain could be reduced to roughly half and still
                  maintain a similar tension to the model painting in the
                  experimental time scale. The wax resin lining also shows a
                  strong vertical shift due to the wax stiffness; however, it
                  also exhibits relaxation characteristics.

                  The addition of relative humidity (RH) fluctuations in
                  <a href="#fig-2-4"><strong>fig. 2.4</strong></a> highlights
                  some further trends in the lined painting response. Sailcloth
                  and linen have no effect on the response of the painting,
                  since the linings do not constrain the paint layers in the
                  direction of applied tension—that is, painting and lining are
                  free to shift across one another. In contrast, the wax lining
                  impregnates the canvas and constrains the paint layers from
                  shrinking or swelling due to contact with the supporting
                  layers of the painting. The paint layers still respond to RH
                  fluctuations; however, the wax adds surface constraint that
                  prevents movement and a subsequent change in tension measured
                  at the ends of the sample. A more in-depth discussion of the
                  CCI Lining Project is provided by Daly Hartin and colleagues
                  ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]); therefore, the following
                  discussion provides more general information regarding the
                  viscoelastic behavior of painting materials.

                  <em>Time-temperature superposition</em>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Over a wide range of test conditions, it is impractical to
                  summarize tensile data from a viscoelastic material with
                  stress-strain curves. It is also not feasible to measure the
                  full relaxation behavior from glassy to rubbery—a process
                  occurring over many decades—at one temperature, due to
                  equipment limitations and time constraints. In
                  <a href="#fig-2-1"><strong>fig. 2.1</strong></a>, it is clear that a relationship exists between strain rate
                  and temperature, since increasing the rate by an order of
                  magnitude is equivalent to decreasing temperature by 10°C.
                  This implies that time-temperature superposition (TTS) is a
                  potential tool for efficiently summarizing data ({Williams,
                  Landel, and Ferry 1955}). To illustrate this method,
                  <a href="#fig-2-5"><strong>fig. 2.5a</strong></a> shows a
                  simplified summary of modulus values at three temperatures and
                  four strain rates within a practical test window. This test
                  window is bounded by equipment limitations and practical time
                  available for data collection.
                  <a href="#fig-2-5"><strong>Fig. 2.5b</strong></a> shows the
                  result of fixing data at a chosen reference temperature,
                  <em>T~ref~</em> = 20°C, and horizontally shifting data at the
                  other temperatures to line up as a single master curve. The
                  result shows a shift from glassy to rubbery behavior over a
                  broader scale than the experiments allowed in direct
                  measurement. Tabulated results of the horizontal shift factor
                  versus temperature allow one to create a master curve at any
                  <em>T~ref~</em> of interest within data limits. Defining
                  <em>T~ref~</em> at the glass transition temperature,
                  <em>T~g~</em>, would also allow comparison with theoretical
                  functions, and possible extrapolation to temperatures beyond
                  the test conditions. There are many reasons why the simple TTS
                  method may not work for certain materials; however, it is a
                  powerful tool when it does.
                </p>

                  It is helpful to consider practical situations where the
                  viscoelastic properties are of importance. As a simple
                  example,
                  <a href="#fig-2-6"><strong>fig. 2.6a</strong></a> shows a
                  schematic of a broken and curled flake of paint that is
                  deformed back into the plane of the painting. The radius of
                  curvature (<em>r</em>) and film thickness (<em>h</em>) are
                  labeled simply to highlight that it is possible to estimate
                  the strain rate from a few parameters and define the time
                  scale of the applied deformation. Rolling or unrolling a
                  canvas painting is another similar and geometrically simple
                  example. In <a href="#fig-2-6"><strong>fig. 2.6b</strong></a>, the stiffness reduction caused by decreasing the rate of
                  deformation is shown as the path from point A to point B along
                  the master curve. In contrast, path A→C indicates the effect
                  of keeping the same strain rate but using higher temperature
                  to shift the master curve horizontally. The higher temperature
                  accelerates the polymer relaxation and leads to a lower
                  stiffness at a given strain rate. The horizontal shift may
                  also be caused by a plasticizing effect, such as an increase
                  in moisture content ([[Maksimov, Mochalov, and Urzhumtsev
                  1972]]). Path A→D shows a final example from the combined
                  effect of decreasing the rate of deformation while also
                  increasing temperature. Care should, of course, be taken when
                  increasing temperature and moisture content, since extremes
                  may cause unwanted effects beyond the simple relaxation
                  process described here.

                  The concepts discussed in this section are often studied using
                  a technique called dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)
                  ([[Nielsen and Landel 1994]]). This can rapidly give modulus
                  data as a function of temperature and frequency using a single
                  sample, and also show transition regions. Experiments
                  involving tensile tests are typically used when the
                  large-strain response, or failure properties, are of interest.

                <p>
                  The purpose of using tensile test data in studies of artists
                  paints is due to the interest in characterizing their
                  large-strain response, particularly the failure criteria as a
                  function of time and temperature. The related research work of
                  Thor Smith in the 1960s is of interest since it shows the
                  application of TTS to the ultimate properties of plastics and
                  elastomers. Smith clearly summarizes an important finding in
                  one of his many papers on this topic:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The ultimate tensile properties (the stress at break σ~b~,
                    and the corresponding extension ratio λ~b~) vary markedly
                    with the temperature and with the stress-time or strain-time
                    history prior to rupture. Considerable evidence indicates
                    that data obtained at different temperatures can often be
                    superposed to give master curves which show the variation of
                    σ~b~ and λ~b~ over many decades of time at a fixed
                    temperature. Further, the temperature shift factor is the
                    same—or nearly the same—as that used to superpose
                    viscoelastic data representing small-deformation behavior.
                    In other words, the same molecular parameters which
                    influence chain mobility, thus the time and temperature
                    dependence of linear viscoelastic response, also have a
                    controlling effect on the time and temperature dependence of
                    the ultimate tensile properties. ([[Smith 1965, 275]])

                  Recent studies on artists paints have highlighted the
                  application of this approach for generating master curves of
                  failure strains from tensile data.
                  <a href="#fig-2-7"><strong>Fig. 2.7a</strong></a> shows a
                  generalized illustration of a failure envelope created using a
                  similar approach to that shown for modulus data (see
                  <a href="#fig-2-5"><strong>fig. 2.5</strong></a>). The path to point A results in failure before reaching the
                  target strain at the defined strain rate. Reducing the strain
                  rate avoids failure for the path to point B, which is outside
                  of the failure envelope.
                  <a href="#fig-2-7"><strong>Fig. 2.7b</strong></a> shows the
                  path to point C outside of the failure envelope due to a
                  horizontal shift of the master curve from a temperature
                  increase or possibly a plasticizing effect (e.g., increased
                  moisture content). Combining higher temperature and reduced
                  strain rate locates point D even further from the failure
                  line.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This concept of a failure strain mastercurve is also shown in
                  figure 2.8 using tensile data from two artists paint films at
                  <em>T~ref~</em> = 20°C ({Hagan 2017}). The acrylic paint film
                  (<a href="#fig-2-8"><strong>fig. 2.8a</strong></a>) shows a considerably larger combination of strains and
                  strain rates that avoid failure compared to the oil paint (<a href="#fig-2-8"><strong>fig. 2.8b</strong></a>). This illustrates why cracking of acrylics latex paints is
                  much less common than traditional oils over a wide range of
                  conditions.

                <p>
                  An overview of the viscoelastic properties of artists painting
                  materials was provided to highlight important trends in their
                  mechanical behavior. Example tensile test and stress
                  relaxation data were presented for paint films and lined
                  painting samples respectively. These data showed a time and
                  temperature dependence on measured stiffness and failure
                  strains. For lined painting samples, stress-relaxation data
                  indicated clear differences in the response of different
                  treatment methods. The sailcloth lining showed value in
                  maintaining consistent tension over time, potentially reducing
                  the amount of strain on the painting for a given tension.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The concepts were further developed through a discussion of
                  the time-temperature superposition principle and the creation
                  of master curves of stiffness and failure strains. This
                  technique can effectively summarize properties over a broad
                  time scale and may be referenced at a temperature of interest.
                  The master curves were used to illustrate how stiffness and
                  failure strains are manipulated by changing the rate of
                  deformation, temperature, or moisture content. In practice, it
                  is not possible to know the shape of these curves for the wide
                  variety of materials found in paintings; however, an
                  understanding of the trends in material behavior is important
                  when applying heuristics to treatment methods.

                  This paper discusses the situation in Denmark before the
                  Greenwich conference on lining of canvas paintings and how the
                  subsequent period of fifteen to twenty years was filled with
                  curiosity, eagerness to try out new ways and ideas, testing of
                  methods and materials, contemplating failures, building of new
                  and glorious equipment—and a longing for better understanding
                  of treatments and the structural behavior of the paintings. In
                  the 1990s, the focus gradually changed. Interventions became
                  more limited, techniques and materials used changed, and
                  development of new treatment methods and materials was
                  deemphasized, while better understanding of the structural
                  behavior of canvas painting and its consequences came to the
                  forefront through increased scientific study of the subject.

                <p>
                  The paintings conservation community in Denmark in the
                  mid-twentieth century, as in many other countries, was
                  composed of, on one hand, individual practitioners working
                  privately for smaller collections and museums, and for
                  historic buildings, and on the other, a few conservators
                  working at larger institutions, primarily museums, in
                  permanent positions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Painting conservators considered themselves craftsmen. Most
                  had a background in the house painting craft<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  or were trained artists from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine
                  Arts School of Painting. Training as painting conservators
                  usually followed an apprenticeship in a conservation studio or
                  work in historic buildings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  House painting or artistic training constituted the background
                  for the approach to treatments, choice of materials, and
                  recipes for treatment. This produced a somewhat conservative
                  approach, based on generations of experience, but it was
                  sometimes open to new approaches or novel materials. For
                  example, newly available commercial materials were adopted,
                  and after the Second World War, internships with and visits by
                  a generation of young conservators to conservation studios
                  across Europe provided inspiration. In this way, for example,
                  in the 1950s, the idea of simple material analysis and
                  photographic documentation gradually found its way to Denmark
                  from Belgium’s Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage
                  (KIK-IRPA) ([[Coremans 1953]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Conservators, in general, mainly undertook treatments without
                  making note of methods and materials, although some books and
                  journals about methods and materials did exist. Danish
                  conservators could draw on a tradition of apprenticeship going
                  back to the early nineteenth century ([[Scharff 1998]];
                  [[Scharff 2000]]), including some treatment descriptions
                  written in Danish ([[Greve 1855]]). Recipe books for house
                  painters or artists were also available, as well as books on
                  gilding and varnishing. Danish painting conservators in the
                  mid-twentieth century knew about and practiced the main trends
                  and techniques of structural treatments from the nineteenth
                  century onwards, including glue-based, glue-paste, and
                  wax-resin treatments, though the latter were not practiced
                  very much until the 1960s, when they were in regular use at
                  the Statens Museum for Kunst (Royal Danish Museum of Fine
                  Arts) ([[Andersen et al. 2014]]). Structural treatments were
                  divided between primary treatments (first linings), and
                  secondary retreatments (relinings), and (much less frequently)
                  more radical treatments such as transfers or marouflage.

                  This aim could well stand as the general effect of the
                  Greenwich conference on the established painting conservation
                  field in the 1970s and onwards and describes the impact on
                  young conservators making their way into the field. A number
                  of publications have dealt with the conference and its major
                  influence, and they often discuss historical developments
                  preceding and following the conference, for example, the
                  introduction to the 2003 postprint publication ([[Villers
                  2003a]]), most recently Hackney’s overview book
                  <em>On Canvas</em> ([[Hackney 2020]]), as well as elsewhere
                  ([[Bomford 2017]]; [[Burnstock 2017]]; [[Hackney 2012]]).
                  Given this background, this paper focuses on information
                  preceding the Greenwich conference that is relevant to
                  developments in Denmark, during the 1970s in particular—a
                  decade with a number of defining events in paintings
                  conservation that have had a lasting impact for the future.

                  The experiences and events of the 1960s formed the immediate
                  background. A new generation of postwar conservators with new
                  experience and ideas gained from abroad were in a position to
                  carry out various structural reforms in their institutions—and
                  to review the approach to treatments followed in most painting
                  conservation studios in Denmark.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For a while in the 1960s, wax-resin treatments were seen as a
                  major improvement and were widely used in combination with the
                  innovative equipment: the new vacuum hot table ([[Andersen et
                  al. 2014]]). Another milestone occurred when the river Arno
                  inundated a major part of the medieval city of Florence and
                  its artwork. Subsequently, conservators from abroad, including
                  eighteen painting conservators from the Nordic countries,
                  participated in the immediate rescue and undertook
                  conservation and restoration treatments ([[Plahter 1999]]).
                  The disaster itself—and the observation that treatment
                  approaches between conservators differed vastly—caused many in
                  the assembled conservation community to reconsider materials,
                  methods, and approaches and to realize that for the future of
                  conservation it would be essential to obtain a more consistent
                  entry to the profession.

                  Formal educational programs could be one of the means, but
                  only few existed at that time in Europe and the Americas. In
                  Denmark, a government commission was formed in 1965. In 1969,
                  it produced a report<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  aimed at establishing new legislation on the protection of
                  heritage in Denmark. The report considered a revision of the
                  conservation strategy and improved conservation facilities in
                  Danish museums, as well as plans to establish an educational
                  program that would supply the museums and the private market
                  with qualified conservation staff. Concurrently, UNESCO was
                  preparing the World Heritage Convention,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  which was widely adopted in 1972 (including by Denmark) with a
                  broad impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Danish conservation community held seminars, lectures, and
                  courses on various subjects while awaiting the inauguration of
                  the School of Conservation, including the development of new
                  equipment and approaches and the testing of alternative
                  materials or methods. These were presented and discussed in
                  the Nordisk Konserverings Forbund (NKF), the IIC Nordic Group,
                  and at international forums including IIC and ICOM congresses,
                  and especially at the ICOM Committee for the Care of
                  Paintings—later to become part of the ICOM Committee for
                  Conservation. The proposal by Percival-Prescott at ICOM-CC in
                  Venice in 1975 to halt lining treatments pending a full review
                  ([[Percival-Prescott 1975]]) was discussed as well, but it did
                  not have a lasting effect in Denmark. It did, however,
                  encourage consideration and testing of alternative and perhaps
                  less intrusive treatment methods.

                  In 1973, Steen Bjarnhof, head of the Statens Museum for Kunst
                  (Royal Danish Museum of Fine Arts) conservation studio,
                  answered a questionnaire distributed by Stephen Rees-Jones,
                  head of the technology department of the Courtauld Institute
                  of Art, University of London, in advance of the Greenwich and
                  ICOM-CC 1975 conferences. His answers<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  revealed the conservation studio’s use of traditional
                  materials and methods and noted the deficiencies of wax-resin
                  linings: canvases becoming slack after wax-resin lining,
                  hygroscopicity even in wax-resin linings. Bjarnhof also
                  reported on experiments with EVA dispersion using
                  “laminations”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  and further information about the experiments and
                  developments, such as those described by Hacke in the 1960s
                  ([[Hacke 1963–64]]) and Bøgh and Ketnath’s experiments with
                  EVA as adhesive ([[Bøgh, Ketnath, and Thorvildsen 1975]];
                  [[Ketnath and Bøgh 1975]]). In 1974, Bjarnhof and other Danish
                  paintings conservators attended the Greenwich conference.

                  Real Changes—The School of Conservation Is Established
                </h2>
                <p>
                  At the time of the Greenwich conference, the Royal Danish
                  Academy of Fine Arts School of Conservation had been
                  functioning for about a year. The founding of the educational
                  program in 1973 resulted in a major, planned change to the
                  field of paintings conservation in Denmark—not at first,
                  perhaps, but gradually over the following years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I entered the paintings conservation program as part of the
                  third admission of undergraduate students in conservation, in
                  late August 1977. There had been many challenges in setting up
                  a training program during the first four years, but the class
                  of 1977 found a three-year educational program with quite a
                  structured curriculum. We attended lectures, undertook a lot
                  of practical work and exercises, and practiced extensive
                  documentation, including photographic and X-ray techniques.
                  Microscopy was the main analytical technique available to
                  study a painting, its surfaces, and layered structure. The
                  thorough process of documenting observations, reflections,
                  descriptions, and errors was considered a major leap forward
                  in the professionalization of the field and underscored the
                  importance of compiling empirical knowledge for future use.
                  Coursework was based on established treatment techniques, but
                  we were also introduced new techniques and materials as
                  directed by teachers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The available literature was limited. Descriptions of
                  established techniques were provided by copies of the small
                  Greenwich offprints, including the useful “Handbook of Terms”
                  (see [[Percival-Prescott and Lewis 2003]]). Bent Hacke and
                  others presented new developments, discussing the outcomes of
                  the Greenwich conference and the innovations of Mehra and
                  Berger. Hacke had experimented with suction-table techniques
                  (termed <em>low-pressure techniques</em>) since the 1960s
                  ([[Hacke 1963–64]]; [[Hacke 1976]]; [[Hacke 1978]]), and in
                  1979 the School of Conservation received its first
                  custom-built low-pressure table, which he had designed. Hacke
                  held a seminar in September of that year for the students on
                  suction-table techniques, in which we tried out the equipment
                  and discussed “requirements” or options for treatments. These
                  requirements were similar to those proposed by Mehra (see
                  [Andersen essay
                  21](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/paper-21))
                  and consisted of a set of principles, requirements, options,
                  and methods guided by a philosophy that had formed over the
                  previous years and constituted the basis for the equipment’s
                  design as well as the techniques employed. The seminar caused
                  quite a stir, as the new equipment, the new techniques, and
                  the whole approach offered interesting alternatives to the
                  techniques we had tried during the previous years of
                  coursework—and had, we understood, been intensively discussed
                  at Greenwich.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We had also begun to follow conservators who were beginning to
                  publish post-Greenwich information on canvas painting behavior
                  and its response during treatment. Everything taken together
                  though, to be honest, made us feel somewhat lost at times. We
                  were trying to understand the real impact of the more
                  established techniques as well as understand how the new
                  techniques worked. It was obvious that more information or
                  knowledge was needed, but we tried to follow the publications
                  and the views expressed, though they at times conflicted
                  somewhat with the views of our teachers and tutors. There was
                  a clear trend towards less intervention, or even no
                  intervention, raising the question of whether to treat or not
                  to treat a given painting. And if treatment was preferable,
                  how were we to approach it?

                  The Thesis Proposal
                </h3>
                <p>
                  To illustrate the introduction of the new techniques for the
                  conservation community in Denmark, I have retrieved my
                  bachelor thesis report, which was based on thesis work done
                  over six months in 1979 and 1980 ([[Scharff 1980]]). It may
                  serve as an example of the knowledge and understanding used at
                  the time for making decisions—from a student’s point of view.
                  The thesis subject was a small seventeenth-century painting in
                  rather deteriorated condition that had been lined with glue
                  paste. Structurally, the lining no longer served a function,
                  the paint layers were cupped all over the surface and the
                  varnish had become opaque. Having established and documented
                  the condition and the problems, the student was to propose a
                  treatment: either an established method using well-known
                  materials, where arguments were less necessary, as it was the
                  normal choice; or one of the new, somewhat experimental (not
                  well established) methods, which would need to be supported by
                  arguments in its favor and references to publications and the
                  recommendations they made. To seriously propose not to treat
                  was not yet an option for a student thesis. My suggestion, to
                  try a new approach, was accepted, and I began a quest for the
                  literature and arguments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to a few 1950s publications on the subject of the
                  then-new hot tables and vacuum hot tables (e.g., [[Ruhemann
                  1952]]<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>), select publications from the 1960s provided critical views
                  on the new lining techniques and specific issues of vacuum hot
                  table treatment practice ([[Brachert 1965]]; [[Linard 1965]];
                  [[Straub 1965]]). Alternative solutions to the drawbacks of
                  established or newer lining techniques were published
                  ([[Berger 1965]]; [[Berger 1966]]; ([[Etchinson 1969]];
                  [[Hacke 1963–64]]; [[Wales 1968]]). Some publications took a
                  different approach that was new to me: attempting to define
                  some of the deterioration mechanisms (e.g., [[Keck 1969]]),
                  indirectly pointing toward a different or better practice in
                  treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The more recent part of the literature review, through the
                  1970s, was easier, as most of the literature (not least the
                  Greenwich conference papers), were relatively accessible and
                  had been recently discussed in the student group. Alternative
                  structural treatments appeared in publications from
                  international organizations such as IIC and ICOM-CC and in
                  national organizations like the NKF and the American Institute
                  for Conservation; a few authors presented ongoing work
                  throughout the decade in journals or at conferences. While
                  some publications were based on a more scientific approach,
                  most were still based on assumptions, a few experiments,
                  practical experience, and tacit knowledge, making it somewhat
                  difficult for students to evaluate the decision making, as
                  they lacked experience and had few examples of a more
                  stringent approach.

                  Examination of the thesis painting, the literature review, and
                  my considerations resulted in a treatment proposal that was
                  primarily based on treatment philosophy and techniques related
                  to Mehra and Hacke—their publications as well as the lectures
                  and workshops with Hacke.

                  The alternative “low-pressure table” equipment to be used, the
                  “lamination” adhesives and technique, and the underlying
                  philosophy rested on a new approach that Mehra and Hacke
                  shared to a considerable degree, but not entirely. There were
                  significant differences between the two, and it is interesting
                  to compare Mehra’s statements (treatment options) from 1972
                  (see [Andersen in this
                  publication](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/paper-21))
                  and his subsequent publications in the 1970s with Hacke’s
                  statements published during the same decade ([[Hacke 1976]];
                  [[Hacke 1978]]), and compiled in 1979 ([<strong>fig. 3.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-1);
                  [<strong>table 3.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/table-3-1)).
                  The second column of table 3.1 presents a set of options for
                  proper lining treatment that came out of a seminar Hacke held
                  at the School of Conservation in September 1979. The list was
                  compiled by the students based on the seminar and Hacke’s
                  previous publications ({Hacke 1976}; {Hacke 1978}).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the thesis, both Mehra and Hacke are referred to, but only
                  the Hacke-inspired (unpublished) statement is listed as an
                  appendix to the thesis. In [<strong>table 3.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/table-3-1)
                  the Mehra and the Hacke statements are shown side by side with
                  the original numbering. They appear mostly to agree, although
                  some statements appear in different order and not all appear
                  in both lists. The main difference is probably regarding the
                  use of heat or raised humidity or liquid water in the
                  treatments, along with a difference of opinion as to its
                  consequences. In the main thesis text, I summed up my opinion
                  regarding each of the statements, listing which option I chose
                  to follow in a condition list ([<strong>table 3.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/table-3-2)).
                  My condition list was introduced with acknowledgments of the
                  ideal nature of the list and the fact that it would probably
                  not be possible to fulfill all of the options. Likewise, I
                  expected that as the treatment progressed the selection of
                  treatment methods and materials most likely would involve
                  compromises compared with the ideal situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A closer look at the treatment options for the thesis work
                  reveals that item 1 (reversibility) was qualified as “optimal”
                  rather than “full” as Mehra has it. At the student seminar the
                  unrealistic option of full reversibility was discussed, while
                  attempting optimal reversibility was accepted to include a
                  possible failure situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Item 2 (“material identity”) was deselected as a treatment
                  condition to avoid material identity between the natural glue
                  materials in the painting and an aqueous animal glue commonly
                  used as a treatment constituent in consolidation. The use of
                  aqueous glue would counter the demands of items 4 and 8. It is
                  further noted in the thesis that item 9 (minimal increase of
                  weight) was also deselected as it was assumed to be of minor
                  significance on the small painting that was the designated
                  thesis subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mehra’s conditions 4, flexibility, and 5, to fully avoid heat,
                  was not included. Nor was Mehra’s term
                  <em>compatible</em> (item 8) used in the arguments for or
                  against the selected materials. In all, where the Mehra and
                  Hacke prescriptions differed, the treatment proposal had a
                  greater affinity with the Hacke statements, for example, by
                  keeping heat as low as possible but not fully ruling it out. A
                  prominent principle listed by Hacke (item 7 in [<strong>table 3.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/table-3-1))
                  was that each treatment step be kept discrete, and Mehra
                  promotes the principle as well in his Venice ICOM publication
                  ([[Mehra 1975a]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The treatment proposal could be seen as trying alternate means
                  to counter the more traditional treatment solutions and their
                  inherent problems, not least by including the new treatment
                  options employing a low-pressure/suction table. In this way,
                  the proposal followed up on the many discussions that came out
                  of the Greenwich conference and subsequent experiments,
                  discussions, and publications that the followed over the next
                  five to six years.

                  Thesis Outcome—Results of the Planned Treatment
                </h3>
                <p>
                  As expected, the actual treatment as described in the thesis
                  did not turn out fully as planned. The final treatment ended
                  up as a selection of compromises to some extent, where some of
                  the ideal demands had to be partly diluted, deselected, or
                  dismissed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For instance, the application of facing paper with an acrylic
                  solution that had been proposed did not work as planned. At
                  the suggestion of the tutors, it was replaced with use of a
                  thin layer of wax-resin paste applied at a temperature of no
                  more than 45°C. In the end, however (according to the thesis
                  documentation), a temperature of 65°C had to be used to ensure
                  the adhesion of the facing paper—thus compromising the idea of
                  keeping the temperature as low as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Subsequent removal of the previous glue-paste lining went well
                  ([<strong>figs. 3.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-2)
                  and
                  [<strong>3.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-3))
                  and so did the flattening procedure. A humidification chamber
                  setup on the low-pressure table was used, with a tabletop
                  temperature of 35°C and pressure at 50 millibars (mbar). To
                  avoid liquid water in the structure, consolidation was done
                  with an acrylic solution, and after solvent evaporation the
                  consolidant was “activated” by heating the painting on the
                  low-pressure table at 100 mbar and 42°C. The linen lining
                  canvas was coated with a layer of thickened acrylic
                  dispersion, and after a drying period, the dry acrylic layer
                  on the lining canvas and the consolidated painting were
                  activated at 100 mbar and 42°C. After cooling the proper
                  lamination was obtained, basically following directions by
                  Hacke and Ketnath ([[Hacke 1976]]; [[Ketnath 1976]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A final, unplanned step in the structural treatment was added
                  at the suggestion of the tutor to remedy a certain canvas
                  structure enhancement and moating—most likely stemming from
                  the previous glue-paste lining. The prescription was a final
                  treatment of the painting, face down on a vacuum hot table at
                  500 mbar and 42°C. The resulting painting surface after this
                  treatment did not exhibit any canvas structure at all, and the
                  painting was ready for the restoration part of the thesis
                  project. However, neither the facedown treatment nor the 500
                  mbar pressure was fully in line with the ideas of the planned
                  treatment. Nevertheless, the restoration went well, and in the
                  summer of 1980 I obtained my bachelor’s degree in conservation
                  and went on to the master’s program.

                  Consequences—Evaluation of a Treatment and Its Consequences
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In general, it is interesting to note how much the new
                  treatment concepts and material choices influenced the
                  treatment design of the thesis work for me and my fellow
                  students, and how little actual knowledge about the impact of
                  the treatment and the choice of materials to use was available
                  to us at the time. Most choices were based on the then-current
                  “demands” or “recommendations,” but they were also partly
                  based on the critique of bygone treatments and materials as
                  discussed in publications during the 1970s and especially
                  after the Greenwich conference in 1974. The Greenwich
                  offprints were also mostly based on assumptions, common sense,
                  and empirical and tacit knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was also interesting to see how treatment inadequacies or
                  shortcomings in the conglomerate of new techniques and
                  materials were addressed by reverting to better known
                  techniques and materials during the thesis
                  treatments—eventually once again reverting to empirical and
                  tacit knowledge. However, this was to gradually change over
                  the ensuing ten to twenty years. At the time of the first
                  thesis, to treat or not to treat was perhaps not yet a mature
                  question to pose, but it would turn out to be an issue of
                  increasing debate in the next couple of decades.

                  Further Developments—The 1980s and Onwards
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In the 1980s, after the relatively new suction table was added
                  as new equipment at the School of Conservation and other
                  conservation studios in Denmark, conservators across the
                  country began to further develop the equipment, as it seemed a
                  useful tool for the treatment of many canvas paintings. The
                  first suction table at the school was rather small, so an
                  all-aluminum suction frame was developed based on the design
                  of larger wooden frames at the National Museum of Denmark and
                  the Museum of Fine Arts. It was constructed to fit the surface
                  of the larger vacuum hot table and could utilize its heat
                  capacity if need be. This made it possible to treat larger
                  paintings with suction table techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Construction of minisuction equipment was the result of one
                  student thesis during these years ([[Mitka 1985]]). A
                  different student thesis included the construction of a large
                  suction table ([[Petéus 1984]]), and another large,
                  experimental table was built by Mitka at the School of
                  Conservation. All these tables had built-in heating capacity,
                  and the latter included conditioned air which flowed in from
                  below or via a chamber above the painting during treatment on
                  the suction table. Built-in sensors enabled the user to follow
                  and record temperature and humidity on paper tape.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Similar new—and even larger—low-pressure tables were designed
                  and built ad hoc for special projects in situ in manor houses
                  or for general use in the Danish conservation studios.
                  Comparable activities took place in many countries, with
                  either in-house designed equipment or commercial
                  suction-tables ([[Reeve 1984]]). The interest in the
                  techniques and equipment (see [Coddington in this
                  publication](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/paper-20))
                  and the results of the construction and use of suction tables
                  were reported and discussed at conferences such as ICOM-CC,
                  including the 1984 ICOM-CC conference in Copenhagen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the following six years, summer schools on the subject were
                  organized at the School of Conservation (in collaboration with
                  ICCROM) to introduce and discuss suction-table techniques and
                  principles and making it possible for numerous participants
                  over the years to try out selected techniques ([<strong>fig. 3.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-4)).
                  Discussions were lively (<strong>[figs.
                    3.5](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-5)</strong>
                  and
                  [<strong>3.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/3-Scharff/fig-3-6))
                  and included technical and ethical debates on the specific
                  aspects of the techniques and the use of new materials. Such
                  topics included nap-bond acrylic dispersion-adhesives,
                  EVA-based adhesives (e.g., Beva 371), fiberglass cloth,
                  limited interventions, temperature, humidity, strip-linings,
                  loose-linings, and much more. In tune with the prevailing
                  discussions in paintings conservation in general, the idea of
                  how much treatment was really necessary—and if so, what
                  kind—was discussed as well, and Percival-Prescott’s 1974
                  concept of the lining cycle and whether to treat or not to
                  treat was a regular part of conversations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In parallel with the summer schools, a set of visual teaching
                  aids was being produced in collaboration with the Getty
                  Conservation Institute. The aim was to produce step-by-step
                  images of the recently developed lining techniques, along with
                  a detailed description of each step, as a didactic tool for
                  teachers in canvas paintings conservation. The aids were used
                  at each summer school and in regular courses at School of
                  Conservation before being finalized in 1990 ([[Scharff
                  1995]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The production of the aids turned out to be a real challenge,
                  since the treatment steps needed to be explained and, if
                  possible, supported by recent knowledge. As the understanding
                  of canvas paintings’ reactions to treatments was very limited
                  at the beginning of the 1980s—and only gradually became
                  supported by publications during the second half of the decade
                  and beyond—it was not always possible to present a
                  well-supported argument for some of the treatment steps or
                  material choices. However, the process for developing the aids
                  was designed to let any teacher using a given treatment add
                  new and relevant information as it became available, as well
                  as to discuss the logic of the approaches with the students or
                  to dismiss some treatment steps as obsolete. In this way, the
                  treatment rationale and background for the treatments could be
                  updated.

                  While some parts of these teaching aids appear outdated today,
                  thirty years later, other parts remain useful, and the whole
                  set serves as both a legacy and documentation of a major
                  evolution in the philosophy and practical approach to canvas
                  paintings conservation in the two decades following the
                  Greenwich conference.

                  Teaching in paintings conservation programs has changed in
                  many respects since the 1980s and 1990s. Less emphasis is now
                  placed on learning a complete set of treatment techniques in
                  favor of a greater concentration on principles and a better
                  understanding of the materials and structures that a painting
                  is composed of, with the aim of better understanding
                  deterioration mechanisms and the properties and impact of
                  treatments and associated materials. Experimental work plays
                  an increasing role, as it further enhances the understanding
                  of the concepts. Hopefully, it will have an impact on whether
                  the future profession concentrates mainly on hands-on
                  treatments or develops a more general approach to entire
                  collections.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The development of a better scientific understanding of the
                  behavior of canvas painting structures themselves, as well as
                  treatment techniques and materials, took place in parallel
                  with the practical experiments and experiences among a limited
                  number of researchers and conservators. Results were published
                  and discussed at conferences, not least at the ICOM-CC working
                  group on structural treatment of canvas paintings that was
                  active at the second half of the 1980s and into the 1990s, as
                  presented in more recent accounts ([[Hackney 2020]]). In
                  particular, publications from Hedley, Mecklenburg, and
                  Michalski provided new insights; Hedley regularly published on
                  the behavior of canvas paintings with a special interest in
                  studying the interaction with humidity ([[Hedley 1993]]).
                  Mecklenburg and Michalski provided new and valuable insights
                  in painting structure behavior, for example at the Art in
                  Transit conference and subsequent publication ([[Mecklenburg
                  1991]]; [[Michalski 1991]]). Such advances originated from or
                  gradually fed into the educational programs in Denmark and
                  abroad, in collaboration with the steadily growing group of
                  practitioners with strong interests in canvas behavior.
                  Without continued research supporting and advancing the field,
                  it would have been impossible to gain a proper understanding
                  of the structure of a painting, its mechanics, and the impact
                  of environment and treatments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The interest in and experiments with new equipment, methods,
                  and materials in the 1980s that resulted from recognizing the
                  need for changes in canvas conservation gradually faded away
                  as a different approach to canvas painting treatments evolved
                  and became accepted. The new approach placed more focus on
                  preventive means, perhaps following principles of more limited
                  interventions, and coincided with the growing popularity of
                  EVA-based adhesives and adhesive sheets and several proposed
                  nap-bond application techniques (although still using a
                  relatively high temperature of 65°C).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, gradually, as treatment methods evolved, a better
                  understanding of the impact of structural treatments emerged,
                  and interest in preventive conservation grew, an increasing
                  number of practitioners became more reluctant to carry out the
                  number of treatments that had been customary in the past.
                  Little by little practitioners began leaning toward the more
                  limited interventions that many have identified collectively
                  using the term <em>minimalism</em> (see, e.g., [[Ackroyd and
                  Villers 2003]]). The increasing impact of preventive
                  conservation and risk management/assessment ([[Antomarchi et
                  al. 2005]]) in decision-making may also influence the approach
                  to the preservation of canvas paintings in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While further development of treatment methods and materials
                  seems largely to have been on hold over the past twenty years,
                  research into canvas paintings’ material structure and
                  mechanics has increased: How is the structure affected by the
                  environment during exhibition or storage? What is the impact
                  of conservation treatments—past and present? A growing number
                  of conservators and scientists are working together in
                  national and international research groups, taking advantage
                  of the steadily growing availability of analytical equipment
                  and methods, including the use of computer modeling to predict
                  behavior. A steady increase in publications in the field also
                  provides everyone in conservation studios and conservation
                  students in educational institutions with an ever-expanding
                  trove of relevant information. Hopefully, in the future, all
                  of this will lead to a to better understanding of material
                  behavior and deterioration phenomena, and we will be able,
                  ultimately, to predict the future response of canvas paintings
                  under given conditions and develop better means to preserve
                  them—either by active treatment procedures or by preventive
                  measures—and thus maintain our cultural heritage for future
                  generations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, we may have passed the point where there were only two
                  options: to treat or not to treat at all. Perhaps the question
                  now should be whether to line or not to line. Luckily, the
                  advances in the field in practice, as well as research since
                  the Greenwich conference, have given us a sounder basis for
                  selecting better options to preserve canvas paintings.
                  Nonetheless, there is still much to learn, and we hope that is
                  will be conducted in the spirit of the Greenwich conference,
                  which laid the ground for nearly fifty years of progress in
                  canvas paintings conservation.

                  Since the 1970s, the Courtauld Institute of Art (CIA) and
                  Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG) (formerly the National Maritime
                  Museum [NMM]) have been at the forefront of developments in
                  lining methods, including research and practice using new
                  adhesives including PVA, Beva 371, and synthetic wax-resin.
                  The RMG worked closely with Stephen Rees Jones and Gerry
                  Hedley from the Technology Department of the Courtauld to
                  adopt their innovative methods, including lining using a
                  vacuum hot table and vacuum envelopes, working together to
                  develop the way paintings would be lined in the future. The
                  present study reexamines archival materials related to the
                  Greenwich Lining Conference and subsequent practical
                  treatments undertaken in the CIA and RMG in the 1970s and
                  1980s. The authors explore the impact of the conference on
                  contemporary practice, and a small group of case-study
                  paintings is presented to evaluate the success and longevity
                  of these treatments after forty to fifty years on display in

                  From the 1970s onwards, the National Maritime Museum (NMM),
                  now Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG), and Courtauld Institute of
                  Art (CIA) were at the forefront of UK developments in lining
                  methods and the use of modern adhesives. NMM conservator
                  Westby Percival-Prescott worked closely with Professor Stephen
                  Rees-Jones and Gerry Hedley at the Courtauld to adopt their
                  innovative methods, including the use of a vacuum hot table
                  and vacuum envelope for lining ([[Percival-Prescott 2003a]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As part of the Getty Foundation’s Conserving Canvas
                  initiative, CIA and RMG collaborated once again to explore
                  lining methods and our common history of lining. The first
                  part of this collaborative project invited an expert panel of
                  liners from the UK and Europe to review the condition of
                  seventeen paintings from the two collections that had received
                  structural treatment in the late twentieth century (see the
                  Appendix at the end of this paper).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  We were interested to assess the longevity of the modern
                  lining methods used in order to inform collections care for
                  the future. Alongside this work, and to establish the
                  structural conservation history of both institutions from the
                  1970s onwards, a survey of all treatment reports was
                  undertaken, and each institution’s conservators were
                  interviewed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of the seventeen paintings (see Appendix) examined by our
                  experts, the majority remained in excellent structural
                  condition, as might be expected, as the treatments were
                  between twenty and fifty years old. Reviewing the treatment
                  documentation alongside the paintings highlighted the change
                  in attitudes towards structural conservation in the ensuing
                  decades.

                  The NMM collection contains approximately four thousand
                  paintings. In 1960, Percival-Prescott joined the NMM and
                  founded the conservation department in the Royal Observatory
                  building ([[Bomford 2005]]). He was joined by Ronald
                  Chittenden, who focused solely on structural conservation, and
                  paintings conservator Gillian Lewis. Thanks to
                  Percival-Prescott’s intense interest in painting materials and
                  his passionate views on ethical methods of conservation, his
                  department built and developed an international reputation
                  ([[Bomford 2005]]). When asked by Dr. Greenhill, then director
                  of the NMM, for a research area that could culminate in a
                  large conference, Percival-Prescott put forward the idea of
                  the structural conservation of canvas paintings, with a
                  particular focus on lining. This was the origin of the
                  Comparative Lining Techniques conference, held in Greenwich,
                  April 23–25, 1974 ([[Percival-Prescott 2003a]]). The
                  conference had an extraordinary impact on the conservation
                  profession, and Percival-Prescott’s keynote speech, “The
                  Lining Cycle,” articulated the trend for minimalism in
                  structural treatment that still prevails today
                  ([[Percival-Prescott 2003b]]).

                  From 1970 to 1974, Percival-Prescott, Lewis, and Chittenden
                  travelled throughout Europe, the East Coast of America, and
                  Russia, to learn more about lining, meeting experts and
                  filming them at work. Upon return to the UK studios, they
                  experimented with the new techniques, adhesives, and fabrics
                  discovered abroad, and extensive (unpublished) peel tests were
                  undertaken in the Engineering Research department of the Royal
                  Naval College, a few of which still remain in the
                  Percival-Prescott archive at the Hamilton Kerr Institute.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>

                </h3>
                <p>
                  To understand the trends and patterns in the use of adhesives
                  and fabrics at NMM, treatment reports from 1963 to 2000 were
                  reviewed and the information collated. Out of the 2,023
                  reports consulted, 447 included structural treatment of some
                  sort (approximately 22% of all paintings treated).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The impact of the 1974 conference was evident in the treatment
                  data, but other factors influenced the types of structural
                  work undertaken. Chittenden’s retirement as a dedicated liner
                  in the early 1980s meant that his workload was absorbed into
                  the work of other paintings conservators in the studio:
                  Caroline Hampton and Sally Wakelin, who both joined in 1974,
                  and Elizabeth Hamilton-Eddy, who joined in 1978. The move to
                  the Feather’s Place conservation studios in 2000 resulted in
                  the loss of the hot-vacuum table due to lack of space, and
                  major structural treatments such as lining were sent out to
                  private studios.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When reviewing the treatment reports from 1965 to 2000, the
                  impact of these various factors was evident: the number of
                  linings diminishes, whereas strip-linings appear in 1974 and
                  quickly become a regular occurrence ([<strong>fig. 4.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-1)).
                  Similarly, a change in thinking was noticeable, for example,
                  in the introduction of other minimal or preventative
                  treatments, such as loose-lining and local reinforcement
                  (corners and edges, and tear-mending).

                </h3>
                <p>
                  In terms of adhesives used for lining and strip-lining, the
                  NMM shows a preference for a small number of adhesives and
                  techniques, which were refined into streamlined processes
                  ([<strong>fig. 4.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-2)).
                  Initially, wax-resin lining is the only method used. Linen was
                  used almost exclusively,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  and reports mention combinations of AW2 or dammar resin with
                  wax and elemi gum, or later, MS2 resin combined with wax,
                  colophony, and elemi.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  These linings were almost all done on the hot table, using the
                  prestretching technique and the vacuum envelope developed
                  in-house ([[Chittenden, Lewis, and Percival-Prescott 2003]]).
                  Chittenden’s reports were usually very brief, such as, “lined
                  in the usual way” or “lined with satisfactory results.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  From 1971 to 1973, five sturgeon glue linings were performed.
                  These are rather rare in the UK and drew upon the team’s
                  training from “masterly restorer Brianzev” in Russia
                  ([[Percival-Prescott 2003a|, viii]]). Reports for the 1971
                  treatment of George Knight’s
                  <em>Cleopatra’s Needle Being Brought to England,</em> 1877
                  (BHC0641), revealed that “sturgeon bladder adhesive” was
                  selected because the work was “painted upon a white ground and
                  of materials which would have yellowed and darkened had wax
                  been used.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  These linings were performed only prior to the conference and
                  were quickly abandoned; studio notes and treatment reports
                  convey the impression that the technique was difficult to
                  master.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beva 371 was used for both strip-lining and lining, combined
                  with a variety of fabrics ([figs.
                  4.2](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-2)
                  and
                  [4.3](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-3)).
                  Initially, the preference was for TenCate, a polyvinyl alcohol
                  fabric from the Netherlands, but this was gradually superseded
                  by polyester sailcloth, beginning in 1982, most likely
                  introduced to the NMM by the Courtauld. Linen was used on one
                  occasion with Beva for lining but more frequently for
                  strip-lining. Other materials were used more sporadically in
                  conjunction with Beva, including woven polypropylene and glass
                  fiber. These fabrics seem to have been used experimentally
                  around the time of the lining conference and were not
                  incorporated into usual practice. Glass fiber, introduced by
                  Pierre Boissonnas ([[Boissonnas 1961]]), was used over a
                  prolonged period (1973–81), in combination with wax-resin,
                  Beva, or Beva with added wax, to help produce transparent
                  linings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As surface deformations could not be addressed during a
                  wax-resin or Beva lining, they had to be treated beforehand.
                  The NMM developed the prestretching technique, first published
                  at the 1974 conference, to introduce tension and address
                  cupping and deformation out of plane ([[Chittenden, Lewis, and
                  Percival-Prescott 2003]]). This technique was used routinely
                  in the 1970s and 1980s.

                <p>
                  Loose-lining starts in the early 1970s, and sixteen paintings
                  were loose-lined in 1975 using either TenCate or Fabrene,
                  possibly in preparation for an exhibition. TenCate was used
                  until 1986, after which it was replaced with polyester
                  sailcloth. One painting was loose-lined with wax-impregnated
                  cotton duck in 1974, possibly as an experiment around the time
                  of the conference. Linen was used regularly for loose-lining,
                  perhaps prioritizing aesthetics over mechanical properties for
                  this purpose (see [<strong>fig. 4.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-3)).

                <p>
                  Many of the paintings selected for assessment by the expert
                  panel were paintings lined using wax-resin in the 1960s and
                  1970s, as well as some that were lined or strip-lined with
                  Beva more recently. Among the paintings selected for
                  examination were several of the seemingly experimental
                  treatments undertaken immediately prior to the lining
                  conference, which reflected the Greenwich team’s interest in
                  learning new techniques. Fabrics included linen of a various
                  weights, cotton duck, and black polypropylene fabric. As
                  discussed below, two very large paintings were also among
                  those selected: one by Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg and
                  another by Carl Saltzmann, treated in 1973 and 1992,
                  respectively ([<strong>fig. 4.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-4)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  An early example of the typical NMM method of wax-resin lining
                  can be seen in the treatment of Matteo Perez d’Aleccio’s
                  <em>The Siege of Malta: Siege and Bombardment of St Michael,
                    28&nbsp;June 1565,</em>
                  1656 (BHC0255). The painting was relined in 1967, and the
                  treatment was deemed successful at the time. However, in 1989
                  the canvas was found to be sagging near the bottom edge, which
                  necessitated removal from the stretcher and restretching. The
                  painting was of a reasonably large size (137.2 x 193 cm) and
                  was exhibited in the time between the two treatments in a
                  fluctuating environment, so these issues were not felt to be
                  particularly surprising.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Due to failure of the previous lining along the top edge, de
                  Loutherbourg’s
                  <em>Defeat of the Spanish Armada, 8 August 1588</em> (BHC0264)
                  was relined in 1973. The work was included in the exhibition
                  accompanying the 1974 conference as an example of a
                  contemporary lining ([<strong>fig. 4.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-5)).
                  A wax-resin relining followed the standard NMM litho paper
                  prestretching ([[Chittenden, Lewis, and Percival-Prescott
                  2003]]). However, complications occurred in the process.
                  Records indicate that the large size of the painting (214.6 x
                  278.1 cm) necessitated relining on the hot table in two parts.
                  After some technical difficulties in heating the table to the
                  necessary temperature, it was found that the lined half
                  displayed cockling due to differential thermal expansion. The
                  expert panel cited cockling as a common phenomenon when
                  paintings were lined in sections and said that this could
                  often be magnified over a large scale. Despite the documented
                  difficulties, our experts agreed that the lining appeared to
                  be performing well, and in the long term these issues did not
                  appear to have a detrimental effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the study, several examples of experimental lining
                  fabrics were examined. Rowland Johan Robb Langmaid’s
                  <em>HMS</em> Dido, Ajax <em>and</em> Orion
                  <em>in Action Off Crete, 21 May 1941,</em> (BHC0678) was lined
                  in 1973 using Beva and a black polypropylene fabric ([<strong>fig. 4.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-6)).
                  Although well adhered, the lining textile is now displaying
                  signs of embrittlement and degradation, with splitting on the
                  turnover edges. Another unusual choice was the wax-resin
                  double lining on cotton duck with a Melinex film stuck to the
                  reverse, which was used in the 1974 relining of Dominic
                  Serres’s
                  <em>Destruction of the American Fleet at Penobscot Bay, 14
                    August 1779</em>, late eighteenth century (BHC0425). Robert Luny’s
                  <em>The East Indiaman</em> York
                  <em>and Other Vessels,</em> 1788 (BHC3735) was lined in 1974
                  onto “post office bagging,” a fairly coarse linen that had
                  been collected as a sample during the research travels prior
                  to the conference.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As indicated by the conservation records, the post-1974
                  conference years saw a general move away from wax-resin
                  linings on linen and toward Beva&nbsp;371 linings on synthetic
                  fabrics. The relining of Carl Saltzmann’s
                  <em>German Fleet Manoeuvres on High Seas</em> (BHC0648) in
                  1992, using Beva 371 on polyester sailcloth, exemplifies this
                  trend. Prior to relining the painting had suffered from a poor
                  mix of glue paste, which exhibited hard lumps, and the
                  inexplicable inclusion of egg and eggshell. As with the de
                  Loutherbourg, the painting’s vast size necessitated lining in
                  two halves, which again resulted in substantial undulations.
                  Once it was off the hot table it was noted that the lining was
                  not well adhered in places, and a hand lining with local
                  pressing was employed to address the problem. Despite the
                  initial issues the lining was very successful, and today it is
                  performing well, with little evidence of the undulations
                  present before the 1992 treatment and only very slight
                  slackness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, those reviewing these paintings in 2019 felt that the
                  vast majority were in good condition and the linings and
                  strip-linings were performing well. Aside from some
                  experimentation around the time of the lining conference, the
                  team at the NMM tended to employ tried-and-tested methods and
                  materials that they developed gradually over the years. This
                  consistent approach surely contributed to their calm ability
                  to overcome obstacles when they arose, as demonstrated in the
                  de Loutherbourg and Saltzmann treatments.

                  The Courtauld collection was established by key bequests of
                  old master paintings and Impressionist works in the 1930s.
                  When the Department of Conservation and Technology was created
                  in 1931, the collection’s paintings were first treated by the
                  experienced tutors and by the students under their
                  supervision. In 1998, Stephen Gritt was appointed as the first
                  Courtauld Gallery conservator, and the majority of this
                  workload shifted away from the Department.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  The students primarily worked on paintings from other museums,
                  societies, and private collections that dated from the
                  fourteenth century to modern periods, with treatments ranging
                  from surface cleaning to full lining/relining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>

                  From the 1950s, the department was involved in lining research
                  ([[Straub and Rees-Jones 1955]]). At the 1974 Greenwich
                  conference, students Hedley, Stephen Hackney, and Alan
                  Cummings presented their research work ([[Hedley, Hackney, and
                  Cummings 2003]]). Vishwa Mehra was invited to the department
                  on at least two occasions (1978 and 1981) to give workshops
                  demonstrating his cold lining technique.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  From 1982 until his untimely death in 1990, Hedley was a
                  lecturer focusing on, among other things, the mechanical
                  properties of synthetic canvases as lining supports ([[Hedley
                  and Villers 1982]]). The environment was thus favorable for
                  experimentation and development of techniques and materials
                  (e.g., [[Phenix and Hedley 1984]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>

                  Two strands emerge in the Courtauld reports: the paintings
                  from the Courtauld Gallery collection and the paintings from
                  external collections. Out of the 1,023 reports consulted from
                  1968 to 1996, 124 included structural treatment of some
                  description (approximately 12%). Only eighteen reports from
                  before 1980 were found, so the pre-1980 areas on the graphs
                  shown in figures here should be interpreted with caution due
                  to the unknown quantity of missing reports. Pre-1980 practices
                  were gathered through interviews with conservators studying or
                  working at the Courtauld during this period.

                  The vacuum envelope table developed by Hedley, Hackney, and
                  Cummings was used from the 1970s until the early 1980s
                  ([[Hedley, Hackney, and Cummings 2003|, 83]]). In 1984, a
                  commercially built lining table, based on the design created
                  in the department in the 1950s, came in as a long-term loan,
                  this was used until 1994. Subsequently a multipurpose suction
                  table with air-flow capability and a conventional hot-plate
                  top was acquired from Willard Conservation Ltd.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  Occasionally, hand linings were also undertaken.

                  CIA has a long history of using wax-resin. Waxes used were
                  beeswax, bleached beeswax, or microcrystalline wax, combined
                  with natural dammar or synthetic resins such as Ketone N or
                  AW2. These mixtures were used exclusively for lining until the
                  early 1970s, when Beva and polymer dispersion adhesives were
                  introduced. The very last wax-resin lining was performed in
                  1990 (<strong>fig. 4.7</strong>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beva was taken up shortly after the 1974 conference. Cummings
                  and Hedley had a long conversation with Gustav Berger during
                  the conference, and that discussion was key to the adoption of
                  Beva at the Courtauld.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
                  PRIMAL AC-634 was introduced to the conservation world by
                  Mehra in 1972 and began to be used at CIA soon after ([[Mehra
                  1972]]). It was used for cold linings until 1984, when
                  research conducted in the department showed its poor aging
                  properties ([[Howells et al. 1984]]). Plextol B500, also
                  introduced by Mehra, was used for cold linings until 1992.

                <p>
                  Fabri-Sil, a Teflon-impregnated glass fiber with a silicon
                  pressure adhesive, was introduced to CIA in the 1980s and
                  studied by Alan Phenix as his student research project
                  ([[Phenix and Hedley 1984]]|, 84.2.39). This product,
                  developed by Fieux, was used seven times at CIA from 1983 to
                  1989 ([[Fieux 1977]]). It was abandoned due the weakness of
                  the bond even after solvent reactivation, and its high
                  cost.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In terms of lining fabrics, CIA experimented with different
                  fabrics, almost entirely synthetics, before settling on
                  polyester sailcloth, a fabric Hedley had thoroughly researched
                  and tested ([<strong>fig. 4.8</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-8))
                  ([[Hedley and Villers 1982, 154]]). Other polyester fabrics
                  included Vylene and Permawear 122. In many treatment reports,
                  lining fabrics were referred to as “polyester” or “polyester
                  fabric,” and it is not possible to know precisely which
                  fabrics were used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Glass fiber was used from 1975 until 1981, most likely for
                  experimentation after the 1974 conference ([[Boissonnas
                  2003]]). There were also a few examples of marouflage onto
                  aluminum honeycomb. Polypropylene was used from 1979 and
                  abandoned by 1981. Lascaux P110, a textile with a similar
                  appearance to linen but made of polyester, was used from 1991
                  until 1995.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As at NMM, the adhesives used for strip-lining are Beva gel
                  and film. The fabrics used for strip-linings are mostly
                  synthetics, apart from one example in 1986 using linen.
                  Synthetics used include Permawear 122, polyester sailcloth,
                  and Lascaux P110.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In terms of loose-lining fabrics, there is more variety than
                  at NMM. While polyester sailcloth was adopted in 1984 and
                  remains in use, other fabrics were also tested. Linen was used
                  from 1985 until 1991 and could be combined with a lining onto
                  synthetic fabric for a more sympathetic appearance from the
                  reverse. Lascaux P110 took over linen from 1992 to 1995.

                  Reviewing the Courtauld paintings with the expert panel, it
                  was striking to see the widespread and enthusiastic adoption
                  of modern lining fabrics and adhesives for the treatment of
                  these works. The documentation of treatments, written in the
                  context of a research and teaching institution, often gives a
                  full insight into the decision-making processes and selection
                  of materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As already mentioned, very few paper records remain for the
                  earliest treatments. For example, the 1969 marouflage of
                  Lucien Pissarro’s <em>Le Brusq,</em> 1923 (P.1932.SC.322) onto
                  aluminum was recorded only by the materials and date inscribed
                  on the rigid support: “April 1969, 90% beeswax, 10% AW2
                  resin.” Similarly, the wax-resin lining of a fire-damaged
                  painting attributed to Giovanni Francesco Barbieri, or
                  Guercino,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  in 1976 is only recorded in a treatment database.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>
                  This lining appears to have been carried out using cotton duck
                  in a manner similar to that of the near-contemporaneous lining
                  of the Serres <em>Penobscot Bay</em> painting at the NMM.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the marouflage appeared to be an extreme intervention,
                  our expert panel remarked that this had been a popular
                  “preventative” measure in the 1960s. Chief among the problems
                  associated with marouflage was weave emphasis resulting from
                  the unyielding nature of the secondary support, an unfortunate
                  outcome in the treatment of the Pissarro. The painting appears
                  structurally sound with no apparent justification for the
                  marouflage. The work seemed to be an example of lining for
                  preventative measures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the 1980s, several Impressionist paintings, accessioned
                  from the Princes Gate bequest, were treated before they went
                  on display in the Courtauld Galleries for the first time
                  ([[Brown 1981]]). All then nearly a century old, these unlined
                  canvasses were suffering from planar distortion and
                  embrittlement. Some paintings had large areas of unpainted
                  ground and delicate impasto, which posed lining challenges.
                  Each painting was treated with a different solution, which
                  highlighted the speed of evolution of thinking in lining
                  practice at the time, as well as the intellectual flexibility
                  of the conservators.

                  Paul Cezanne’s <em>Turning Road (Route Tournante),</em> 1905
                  (P.1978.PG.61) was treated in 1980 using a low-pressure,
                  cold-lining technique learned from Mehra in 1978. The
                  adhesive, Primal A-C64 thickened with Natrosol, was applied
                  through a mesh screen. One particular concern was the danger
                  of staining and potentially darkening the ground with the
                  adhesive. The report describes painstaking spectrophotometer
                  readings, taken before and after treatment. The lining fabric
                  was polyester, Permawear 122, and the report contains
                  correspondence with the manufacturer. The deformations out of
                  plane ([<strong>fig. 4.9a</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-9))
                  were treated prior to lining by misting with water and drying
                  on the cold lining table at minimal pressure (8.5 cm water),
                  repeated three times with local weighting. The treatment was
                  deemed a success and was subsequently chosen to illustrate a
                  book in Gerry Hedley’s memory ([[Hedley 1993]]). Although it
                  was incorrectly described as a Plextol lining, the success of
                  the flattening moisture treatment and the lining in retaining
                  the improved surface is commented on in the picture caption.
                  Our expert panel agreed the lining was extremely successful in
                  terms of correcting overall distortion while keeping a very
                  light, unlined feel ([<strong>fig. 4.9b</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-9)).
                  Only one area of lifting of the lining on the turnover edge
                  was identified, but this was not felt to be an indicator of
                  more widespread failure concerns.

                  Edouard Manet’s
                  <em>Au Bal—Marguerite de Conflans en Toilette de Bal,</em>
                  1870–80 (P.1978.PG.233) was treated the following year, in
                  1981, to address the buckling of the canvas recorded in raking
                  light photographs before treatment. Caroline Villers’s
                  recommendation seemed to follow the successful precedent set
                  by the treatment of the Cezanne painting: to carry out a cold
                  lining at low pressure. A change of plan is described with
                  Villers’s typical understatement: “Although the tacking margin
                  had not seemed to exhibit exceptional sensitivity to
                  moisture…the canvas was found to be extremely responsive.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                  They switched to using Beva with sailcloth at 60°C–65°C and
                  using 12"Hg vacuum envelope pressure. The envelope system
                  was designed to avoid textural changes, and the conservators
                  also removed large slubs and residues from the reverse prior
                  to lining. However, when reviewing the treatment with the aid
                  of archive raking light images, it did seem that there had
                  been some increased weave emphasis. Despite this, the
                  treatment was published by Hedley as an exemplar treatment the
                  following year ([[Hedley and Villers 1982|, 157]]). It was
                  interesting to reflect on this treatment with the expert
                  group. It seemed to particularly highlight the change in
                  attitudes towards lining over the 38 years since this painting
                  was treated. The consensus now would be to accept the
                  deformations out of plane and to try to avoid lining for as
                  long as possible.

                  Edgar Degas’s <em>Lady with a Parasol,</em> 1870–72
                  (P.1978.PG.87) was treated almost immediately after the Manet.
                  The painting was first strip-lined using Permawear 122 and
                  Beva, but during restretching the original canvas fractured
                  along the turnover edge. At this point, close to the
                  exhibition opening, it was decided to mend the tear locally
                  and return to the painting after the show. The painting
                  returned for treatment in 1983 in preparation for considerable
                  travel as part of a loan to Japan and Australia, and the
                  decision was taken to line the painting ([<strong>fig. 4.10</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/4-Polkownik/fig-4-10)).
                  Hedley, leading the treatment, selected Fabri-Sil, but adapted
                  the process to incorporate solvent activation, which was
                  concurrently investigated by Phenix in his research project
                  ([[Phenix and Hedley 1984]]). Using solvent activation, the
                  peel strength of Fabri-Sil increased to approximately match a
                  “strong wax-resin” formulation. Despite the treatment being
                  among the early Fabri-Sil linings, our inspection of the
                  painting found that the experimental method performed well:
                  the impasto looks crisp and sharp, and the ground layer
                  appears unchanged by the adhesive, with the lining remaining
                  well adhered throughout.

                <p>
                  Reflecting on past practice at both institutions, the impact
                  that the sharing of knowledge had in the years surrounding the
                  Greenwich lining conference was apparent. Both institutions
                  were enthusiastic about adopting new methods, adhesives, and
                  fabrics, underpinned by comparison with existing methods to
                  ensure that new techniques were at least as good as old. Most
                  treatments appear to have aged well thus far, although some
                  adhesives and fabrics have unknown aging characteristics in
                  the longer term.

                  The variety of adhesives used by the NMM conservators was
                  clustered around a very specific period: a few years before
                  and after the 1974 conference. As organizers, the conservators
                  wanted to explore all avenues of new materials and methods.
                  The experimentation led to the elimination of unsuitable
                  methods and materials, such as sturgeon glue linings and black
                  polypropylene as lining support, and the refinement and
                  adoption of methods and materials that fitted their collection
                  and work ethos. The Courtauld showed how research conducted
                  within the department informed choices of adhesives and
                  fabrics.

                  The rationale behind structural treatments was explored
                  through interviews with conservators and by reading the
                  archival documentation. Reviewing treatments with our expert
                  panel highlighted how much attitudes have changed over time
                  and the lasting influence of minimalism that was ushered in by
                  the Greenwich conference. Nowadays, the inclination is to
                  resist intervention until the point of complete failure. The
                  conclusion drawn from the 2019 examination was to prolong the
                  life of existing linings by shoring up failures at turnover
                  edges, reactivating old glues, or feeding in adhesive for
                  localized delamination. Future research will explore this
                  topic further by revisiting paintings identified as in need of
                  lining—but not treated in the 1970s due to time or budget
                  constraints—to assess their condition now.

                  The paper outlines the contribution of the Neapolitan
                  tradition to the structural conservation of paintings on
                  canvas. It is possible to trace the existence in the
                  eighteenth century of diversified practices, which included
                  the use of temporary stretchers for lining. It also defines
                  the <em>mesticatori-foderatori</em> (fillers-liners),
                  professionals who specialized in the preparation of new
                  canvases for painting and the lining of old ones. A profound
                  knowledge of the materials of painting during the nineteenth
                  century in the Museo Borbonico advised extreme caution in
                  interventions on glue-tempera paintings by Parmigianino and
                  Bertoja, which were not lined but equipped with additional
                  canvases. The use of transfer has been practiced since the
                  eighteenth century in Naples but has been consciously avoided
                  in the nineteenth century in the museum and only put into
                  practice at the beginning of the twentieth century, with
                  questionable results. In the second half of the twentieth
                  century an improvement to traditional lining techniques was
                  found by Antonio De Mata, who developed an effective procedure
                  for the preventive consolidation and lining of paintings on
                  canvas that reduced the risks of humidity. With due caution,
                  this method continues to be effective in many cases.

                <p>
                  The intention of this paper is to outline the important
                  contributions made by the Neapolitan tradition of structural
                  conservation of paintings on canvas, the history of which
                  remains little known. Knowledge of this tradition has
                  increased over the past twenty years thanks to studies that
                  have brought to light many documents presented during two
                  conferences held in the Capodimonte Museum in 1999 and 2007
                  (see [[Catalano and Prisco 2003]] and [[D’Alconzo 2007})}.
                  These studies made it possible to compare elements from the
                  examination of the paintings themselves, elucidating the
                  contents of the documents and allowing an understanding of the
                  methods employed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A number of interesting elements were thus brought to light,
                  such as the distinction—as early as the eighteenth
                  century—between the “artistic” operations of cleaning and
                  retouching and those of lining/consolidation, which were
                  entrusted to the “liner” rather than the “restorer.” The
                  studies highlighted the existence in the eighteenth century of
                  diverse practices in the museums, often limited to cautious
                  interventions, together with an awareness of the specificity
                  of the materials involved. Traditionally, animal glue and
                  flour paste were almost exclusively the materials employed to
                  consolidate the paint layers and line the canvases throughout
                  the period under consideration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These studies also identified the presence of certain
                  “professionals” who specialized in the preparation of new
                  canvases for painting and in the lining of old ones. The
                  history of the Chiarello, a family of
                  <em>mesticatori-foderatori</em> (filler-liners) from the
                  eighteenth to twentieth centuries, is of particular interest.

                <p>
                  The history of the profession of <em>foderatore</em> (liner)
                  in Naples sits at the intersection of craft, art, and
                  profession, and it is here where the definition of the
                  discipline of conservation-restoration unfolds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1960, Raffaello Causa—the renowned art historian who in the
                  1970s and ’80s would direct the <em>soprintendenza</em> for
                  the Historical and Artistic Heritage of Naples, and who at
                  that time headed the restoration laboratory of the Capodimonte
                  Museum, highlighted this aspect by observing how in our city
                  the conservation of paintings on canvas had been guaranteed by
                  means of “an indisputable skill—and we would like to say a
                  reckless ease—with which the lining of the canvases was
                  performed here in Naples, an operation widely practiced by
                  local restorers” ([[Causa 1960|, 10]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fact, it is possible since at least the eighteenth century
                  to trace the evidence and documents relating to the practice
                  of <em>rintelaggio</em> or <em>foderatura:</em> the
                  consolidation of deteriorated textile supports carried out by
                  gluing these onto a new canvas. We also find that such
                  activities were carried out early on by a particular figure,
                  the <em>telaiolo,</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  or manufacturer of canvases for painting, who would also
                  repair damaged canvases if required.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of these craftsmen was Giuseppe Maria Ranzenò, known as il
                  Filosofo (the Philosopher), who as early as 1726 was paid for
                  “<em>due tele imprimate</em>” (two primed canvases) ([[Pavone
                  1994|, 140]]). In 1740, he supplied some cases of canvas to
                  the Reale Arazzeria, established by Charles of Bourbon, which
                  produced many splendid tapestries for the royal residences
                  ([[Siniscalco 1979|, 278]]). The Arazzeria was based in Via
                  San Carlo alle Mortelle, together with the Pietre Dure
                  laboratory, in the same location where the Art Academy would
                  soon be born.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other testimonies regarding the activity of the Arazzeria
                  between 1761 and 1768 clarify the specificity of Ranzenò’s
                  profession. This information is found in a collection of
                  documents published in 1979 as part of a campaign of
                  wide-ranging research aimed at reconstructing the various and
                  multifaceted artistic activities of the eighteenth century,
                  thanks to a group of historians whose scholarship would come
                  together to give rise to the great
                  <em>Civiltà del Settecento a Napoli</em> exhibition in Naples
                  (December 1979–October 1980) ([[N.&nbsp;Spinosa 1979]]; [[<em>Civiltà del ’700 a Napoli</em>
                  1980]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the Reale Arazzeria, several painters, including Girolamo
                  Storace, Giuseppe Bonito, and Orlando Filippini, were engaged
                  to create oil paintings that served as a guide to tapestry
                  weaving ([<strong>figs. 5.1a</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-1)
                  and
                  [<strong>5.1b</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-1)).
                  Giuseppe Maria Ranzenò supplied them with prepared canvases on
                  which to make their models, and for this reason in the
                  documents he is called “<em>mesticatore</em>” ([[Siniscalco
                  1979|, 282]]), from <em>mestica</em>, the mixture with which
                  the canvases were prepared for painting. But we also find him
                  at work in other activities closely related to those of the
                  painters active for the Arazzeria, which he assisted with all
                  aspects relating to the preparation of the supports.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A payment note dated 1763 describes the variety of these
                  supplies. It refers to a “canvas for painting made by Giuseppe
                  Maria Ranzenò called the Philosopher, ordered by the Court
                  Painter D. Giuseppe Bonito to make the frieze of the tapestry
                  by the painter Filippini,” and the canvas is described as,
                  “with its good stretcher with the crossbar, prepared with
                  priming the color of lead white” ([[A. Spinosa 1979, 382]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A real restoration is then described of two old
                  <em>modelli</em> for the frieze. Orlando Filippini was in
                  charge of painting the patterns for the floral friezes that
                  adorned the tapestries, the main “stories” of which were then
                  entrusted to Bonito. Indeed, in 1768, the same Ranzenò would
                  still declare he had supplied Filippini with the canvases on
                  which to paint “the flowers for the friezes” ([[A. Spinosa
                  1979, 383]]). Evidently, sometimes these oil paintings that
                  served as <em>modelli</em> for the friezes were reused, and
                  this explains the restoration of the “old <em>modello</em> for
                  the frieze” mentioned in the note of 1762: “It has been lined
                  with a single piece of fine canvas and it has been filled in
                  many areas having first flattened it on a larger stretcher;
                  then it was attached to its own stretcher that was in the
                  Arazzeria” ([[A. Spinosa 1979, 382]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining procedure is described here with details rarely
                  found in the sources. The document indicates the type of
                  canvas used: “<em>fina</em>” (fine, or thin) and “a single
                  piece” (that is, without seams). It describes the use of a
                  stretcher that we would now call temporary: larger than the
                  original one, prepared specifically for the lining procedure.
                  And it tells us that the lined painting was then placed back
                  on its original stretcher.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also learn that Ranzenò filled the gaps with
                  “<em>stucco</em>” (filler), and we therefore learn that this
                  phase of the restoration was carried out by the liner himself.
                  In fact, the <em>stucco</em> used at the time for these
                  reparations was of a nature closely related to the
                  <em>mestica</em>—a mixture of oil and pigments with which new
                  canvases were prepared for painting (applied over a layer of
                  animal glue plus other ingredients such as flour, starch,
                  sugar). And as mentioned, Ranzenò is described precisely as a
                  <em>mesticatore.</em> The profession of one who prepares
                  canvases for painting was evidently already well defined at
                  the time and closely linked to that of the supplier of
                  canvases and stretchers—and finally to that of a liner and
                  repairer of canvases. The profession that we would call
                  restorer, but it was at the time—and for a long time
                  after—reserved for the operations considered more “noble”: the
                  “restoration” was the pictorial one, of the painting surface,
                  and the specific task of the artist. It was not yet
                  autonomous.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Paradoxically, however—precisely because it belonged to a
                  subordinate profession that lacked pretensions to artistry—the
                  type of restoration that we would call conservative, related
                  to the mending and lining of the canvas, already appears in
                  the mid‑eighteenth century with characteristics and methods
                  that have been perpetuated (with necessary adjustments), up to
                  the present day.

                  The Eighteenth-Century Restorations for the Royal Museum
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In the years 1758 and 1759, Ranzenò was engaged in the
                  restoration of the paintings from the Royal Collection housed
                  in the Palace of Capodimonte, where he directed two
                  <em>stiratori</em> (ironers), Nicola di Mauro and Pasquale
                  Senzapaura, who in this case worked exclusively on the
                  repairing and relining of canvases ([[Filangieri di Candida
                  1902|, 225]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In these years, Father Giovanni Maria della Torre was the
                  custodian of the Farnese Collection in the palace, and in
                  charge of setting up the gallery. In a letter in which he
                  gives an account of the work on the paintings, he describes
                  the intervention of the ironers as follows: “The
                  <em>accomodamento</em> [repair] of them consists in tensioning
                  again, repairing, and changing the canvases, and working on
                  them. All this is carried out by <em>manuali</em> [skilled
                  workers].”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is a further subdivision of the work. “The other part of
                  the <em>accomodamento</em> consists of filling the holes of
                  which there are many, making good the flaking […] with the
                  utmost diligence and skill by means of the
                  <em>stucco a colore</em> [colored filler].”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  This operation is assigned to Andrea Liano, an artist of
                  limited prestige who dedicated himself to the diligent repair
                  of paint losses, recovering the unity of the paintings; as a
                  result, they are deemed “so perfect that they do not require
                  anything further.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  Although it is difficult to identify with certainty
                  restorations of this historical moment and situation, we can
                  very frequently identify paintings that contain traces of
                  restorations dating back to the eighteenth century in which
                  the losses are filled with a material composed of oil and
                  earth pigments, completely similar to the preparation applied
                  on the canvases at the time. We can imagine that this phase,
                  carried out with care, effectively recovered the material—and
                  even chromatic continuity, to a certain extent—of the
                  painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contrast to the assessment of the <em>accomodamento</em>,
                  the artistic restoration, entrusted to the court painter
                  Clemente Ruta, is questioned by della Torre, who reports the
                  critical opinion of the connoisseurs (<em>Intendenti</em>): “I
                  therefore do not see what else is desirable for these same
                  paintings, and consequently I do not see any need for the
                  painter D. Clemente Ruta to bring them to the Royal Palace of
                  Naples, if not to give them a brushstroke or two, or some
                  varnish, which in the opinion of all the
                  <em>Intendenti</em> is to alter the old paintings.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A distinct intermediate activity was therefore taking shape—if
                  not conservation, exactly, perhaps adjusting or repairing—a
                  field of action somewhere between lining and artistic
                  restoration in which both Ranzenò and his collaborator
                  Senzapaura—the latter also called the Philosopher in his
                  turn—were involved. Between 1762 and 1775, the two were
                  engaged in the restoration of the copper paintings by
                  Domenichino, Ribera, and Stanzione in the Cappella del Tesoro
                  of San Gennaro in Naples Cathedral. The restoration of the
                  paintings on copper would have included a cleaning but also
                  probably consolidation of the flaking layers of paint, a
                  consistently recurring conservation problem throughout the
                  history of the numerous interventions on the seven great
                  altarpieces (see [[Cerasuolo 2010|, 113]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A few years later we see the emergence of the
                  <em>telaiolo</em> Pasquale Chiariello, the first exponent of a
                  family of restorers whose names we meet over a very broad span
                  of time, from the late eighteenth to the second half of the
                  twentieth century. In 1796, the latter supplied prepared
                  canvases to the painter Tischbein: “Six
                  <em>tele impresse</em> were delivered by the
                  <em>telajolo</em> Pasquale Chiariello to the Director of the
                  Royal Academy of Painting, D. Guglielmo Tischbein, to paint
                  figures on them” ([[Cerasuolo 2007|, 29]]). From that date
                  until almost to our own times, the activity of the Chiariello
                  family as manufacturers of canvases and as liners unfolds
                  seamlessly. From 1826 to 1828 we find repeated references to
                  the “<em>foderatori Raffaele e Antonio Chiariello</em>”
                  engaged in work for the preparation of the Real Museo
                  Borbonico ([[Catalano 2007]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the 1820s, in the preparation for the opening of the museum
                  in the rooms of Palazzo degli Studi (the current Museo
                  Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli), an intense campaign of
                  restorations was undertaken, for which many important
                  documents have survived, such as notes drawn up in order to
                  estimate the necessary expenses ([[D’Alconzo 2003]]). For the
                  “canvas paintings of the Neapolitan School” a summary table
                  lists the paintings (thirty-two works, including ones by
                  Jusepe de Ribera, Luca Giordano, Salvator Rosa, and Aniello
                  Falcone), and links them over three columns to the list of
                  operations envisaged: “<em>Foderatura e tutt’altro occorre al completo</em>” (Lining and anything else is needed in full), “<em>Spianatura a colla e rassetto in telaro</em>” (Glue leveling and rearrangement on the stretcher), “<em>Telari a zeppe</em>” (Stretchers with wedges)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  (see [[Cerasuolo 2008|, 28]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The operations described in the first two columns are
                  obviously alternatives. In fact, in less serious cases, in
                  place of the lining, only the <em>spianatura</em> operation
                  would be performed. From other documents we can better
                  understand what this “flattening” consisted of: the
                  consolidation of the paint layers carried out by applying
                  animal glue—the “strong glue” traditionally used for this
                  purpose and also used for the lining—on the reverse of the
                  canvas, without removing the painting from the stretcher, and
                  then ironing it in this way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The application on a new stretcher, “<em>a</em>
                  <em>zeppe</em>”—that is, with triangular wedges that allow the
                  canvas to be put back under tension—is almost systematically
                  proposed for lined paintings but could occasionally also be
                  carried out for those subjected to “flattening” only<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  (see [[Cerasuolo 2008|, 28]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, an expense report, for the treatment of Ribera’s
                  <em>Drunken Silenus</em>, describes the operation as follows:
                  “flattening from the front of the painting, glue on the back,
                  stretched onto the new frame and fully adjusted.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is interesting to observe that diversified practices are
                  adopted, but always implemented with materials compatible with
                  those originally used, and at the same time to note that
                  harmful practices were not employed, even though they were
                  widespread in other contemporary contexts, especially in
                  northern Europe. Such practices include the application of
                  <em>beveroni</em> (see [[Conti 2007|, 106]]), oily substances
                  of various natures applied to the reverse of canvases in order
                  to consolidate and revive their colors—which, however, over
                  time caused irreversible darkening of the tones and
                  contraction of the pictorial layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the Real Museo of Naples also, we see that both the lining
                  and the operations relating to the carpentry of the paintings
                  on panel were practiced by professional figures distinct from
                  the “restorers” who were entrusted with the operations deemed
                  more noble, namely, cleaning and pictorial restoration. The
                  work of these operators was often assessed separately,
                  although sometimes the payment was made through the party who
                  took care of the “artistic” part of the intervention
                  ([[Cerasuolo 2008|, 28]]).

                  A Family Tradition: The Chiariello
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In the middle of the nineteenth century, we meet Francesco
                  Chiariello working for the Real Museo. He was an important
                  person who proudly claimed the rights of the profession of
                  <em>telaiolo</em>. Chiariello became very popular among
                  Neapolitan artists of the time, acquiring a singular
                  reputation and importance—so much so that he is remembered by
                  various writers as an authoritative adviser. In the memoirs of
                  the life of the painter Bernardo Celentano, written by his
                  brother Luigi, for example, we find many references to him.
                  Bernardo buys his canvases from Chiariello—indeed in a letter
                  from Rome he considers the possibility of having a large
                  canvas sent from Naples, and we learn the address of his shop,
                  in Via Fosse del Grano, in the neighborhood called Museo. An
                  unusual episode then shows the ease with which Chiariello
                  offers himself to help the novice artist Bernardo in solving a
                  problem of perspective, involving for this purpose a very
                  young Domenico Morelli ([[Cerasuolo 2007|, 32–33]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A lively description by Vittorio Imbriani also allows us to
                  identify the portrait of Francesco Chiariello—called by the
                  diminutive Ciccio—in a gentleman depicted by Giovanni
                  Ponticelli in the historical painting
                  <em>The Convalescent Cavalier Bajardo</em>, presented in 1867
                  in the exhibition
                  <em>Quinta Promotrice Napoletana</em> ([<strong>fig. 5.2</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-2)).
                  Imbriani produced a booklet to accompany the exhibition (which
                  is later cited by the eminent historian and philosopher
                  Benedetto Croce), and it includes a description of the
                  <em>telaiolo</em>: “Ciccio Chiariello, the medal-winning
                  <em>telaiuolo</em> who supplies canvas to all the painters of
                  Naples, richly disguised as an Italian gentleman of the times,
                  is observing the scene” ([[Cerasuolo 2007|, 25–26]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>telaiolo</em> referred to in the description clearly
                  highlights the characteristics that make his figure singular,
                  in some way unique, in the nineteenth-century Neapolitan
                  artistic scene: he provides canvas on which to paint “to all
                  the painters of Naples,” and he is so highly thought of as to
                  be honored with awards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Francesco Chiariello had in fact received a silver medal as a
                  prize in the Solenne Mostra Industriale of 1853, the last of
                  the major biannual exhibitions dedicated to the products of
                  the National Industry of the Bourbon Kingdom. These
                  exhibitions, held by the Reale Istituto d’Incoraggiamento,
                  were aimed at encouraging entrepreneurs’ initiative and
                  supporting the manufacturing activities that had once been
                  promoted and financed by the royal court.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The exhibition of 1853 divided the exhibits into five
                  categories: Chiariello exhibited his “<em>tele buone da dipingere</em>” (good canvases for painting) in the class collectively
                  described as “different objects” and was awarded the Silver
                  Medal “for the improvement of canvases for painting,” as we
                  read in the relative *Disamina—*a report of the examination
                  made by the commission of Reale Istituto. After an interesting
                  excursus on the various types of canvas congenial to the
                  different inclinations of the artists, the “<em>artiere Chiariello</em>” is praised for his ability to prepare canvases of various
                  fabrics and preparations “corresponding to the wishes of our
                  painters.” ([[Reale Istituto d’Incoraggiamento 1855|,
                  231–32]]; see also [[Cerasuolo 2007|, 30–32]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this context, the social elevation of the “craftsman
                  Chiariello” suggests a new awareness of the dignity of the
                  artisan craft and the value of entrepreneurial skills, and
                  speaks to the personal esteem and friendship of the artists to
                  whom he supplied the “good canvases”—a guarantee of the
                  durability of their works.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Francesco was evidently proud of these medals, so much so that
                  in a plea presented to the king to claim his rights as
                  “manufacturer of canvas for painting, and liner of
                  paintings”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  he cited the entire text praising him that lay behind his
                  award from the Reale Istituto d’Incoraggiamento. In his plea
                  he asked to be named “Foderatore del Real Museo Borbonico” and
                  claimed as his right—“acquired with great labor”—the exercise
                  of the profession of liner. He also complained that “often
                  restorers”—clearly those who dealt with “artistic”
                  restoration—“allow themselves, to the detriment of art, to put
                  onto canvas paintings that should by rights have been handed
                  to the petitioner.” In addition to the services already
                  offered to the Real Museo, he cited as a credential the “large
                  silver medal” won in the public exhibition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Francesco Chiariello’s familiarity and friendship with
                  Neapolitan artists—foremost among these Domenico Morelli and
                  Giuseppe Palizzi—will be testified to, at a much later date,
                  by the certificates his son Pasquale obtained in order to
                  promote the elevation in his social status. This enterprising
                  son, in fact, succeeded in obtaining a further prestigious
                  award from King Vittorio Emanuele III in 1901: the concession
                  to “display the Royal Crest on the sign of his studio,” which
                  together with the medals won in public exhibitions will
                  prominently feature on his letterhead (see [<strong>fig. 5.3</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-3)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Permission to display the royal crest was gained thanks to an
                  impressive list of accolades by the best-known artists and
                  scholars of the time. Reference letters were signed between
                  1896 and 1900 by Domenico Morelli, Filippo Palizzi, Giulio De
                  Petra, Vittorio Spinazzola, and Vincenzo Caprile; a group of
                  professors from the Royal Institute of Fine Arts signed a
                  collective document that reads, “for a long time . . . the
                  paintings in need of lining or restorations are entrusted
                  exclusively to him either at the Real Istituto di Belle Arti
                  or by the Museo Nazionale, the Museo di San Martino, and the
                  Pinacoteca Reale of Naples.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  These reference letters also refer to Pasquale’s father, and
                  it is emphasized that the son, in the excellence of the
                  results, “even surpassed Francesco Chiariello himself, who was
                  his father and teacher, and was the first in this genre.” They
                  further highlight that “Chiariello always successfully
                  maintained the name of his father as the first preparer of
                  canvases for painting,” and on the quality of these canvases
                  they add interesting observations: “These canvases of special
                  and varied preparations have the characteristics of excellent
                  fabrics, the right amount of material and aging, so that they
                  are not subject to cracking, and the painting that the artist
                  executes on it does not alter with time, as is often seen with
                  poorly prepared and improperly aged canvases.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The emphasis is therefore placed on a direct relationship
                  between the guarantee of durability ensured by the excellence
                  of the products prepared by Chiariello and his ability to
                  restore this durability to damaged old paintings.

                  Knowledge of Materials and Careful Interventions
                </h2>
                <p>
                  To great expertise in the practice of lining, Neapolitan
                  liners added a profound knowledge of the materials of
                  painting, which during the nineteenth century advised extreme
                  caution in interventions. We have found evidence—both material
                  and documentary—of interesting interventions in the case of
                  two glue-tempera paintings: Parmigianino’s
                  <em>Holy Family,</em> and Bertoja’s
                  <em>Virgin and Child</em> ([<strong>figs. 5.4</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-4)

                  respectively) ([[Cardinali et al. 2002]]). Both interventions
                  are notable in their sensitive attention to the behavior of
                  the materials involved. In these two beautiful canvases, the
                  rare qualities provided by the medium have been preserved
                  thanks to the care taken, which ensured their good
                  conservation, and which is still effective today.

                  A document signed by the restorer Pasquale Chiariello dated
                  September 6, 1899, lists the “lining works” he carried out in
                  the National Museum of Naples. In the same list it is
                  specified that the paintings defined as
                  <em>guazzi</em> (glue-tempera paintings) “were only put behind
                  glass and ‘conditioned’ in order to avoid further damage.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The examination of the paintings revealed that the canvases of
                  the Bertoja and of the Parmigianino were not lined but
                  equipped with an additional canvas: both have been
                  “conditioned” in a similar way: using a densely woven fabric,
                  not glued, but only stretched on the reverse for protective
                  purposes, and fixed to the edges with nails that also tension
                  the original canvas ([<strong>fig. 5.6</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-6)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The edges of the canvases were fixed with strips of wood
                  nailed along the perimeter to the stretcher and then wrapped
                  with a glued paper. The stretchers, from different and

                  Glue-tempera makes colors look soft and light and is easily
                  spoiled by the application of varnish or oily materials. In
                  fact, glue, although relatively strong as a binder, does not
                  form a continuous, even film on the surface, which therefore
                  is quite porous. As a result, the colors once dried appear
                  lighter and less saturated than when wet (see [[Cerasuolo
                  2017|, 220–30]]; [[Cerasuolo 2019]]).

                  A conscious and attentive protective intervention driven by
                  the same care was taken with the two <em>Tüchlein</em> by
                  Bruegel, which were placed under the glass as a preventive
                  measure, rejecting the choice of more invasive interventions
                  so as not to distort the optical qualities of the medium (see
                  [[Cerasuolo 2017|, 220–30]]; [[Cerasuolo 2019]]).

                  The documents testify to a remarkable awareness of the
                  conservation problems posed by these works, which resulted in
                  efforts of a purely conservative nature, thus avoiding the
                  risks entailed by intrusive interventions. In 1846, Camillo
                  Guerra, a professor of painting, wrote to the director of the
                  museum reporting on the poor condition of the two Bruegels. In
                  an 1847 document in reference to one of the two paintings, he
                  wrote that “as it is painted in glue-tempera it is more easily
                  subject to deterioration.” On May 13, 1853, the Commissione
                  dei Restauri (the commission of artists who supervised
                  restorations at the Museum) took the decision “to put behind
                  glass the two tempera paintings by Pieter Bruegel, which are
                  kept in the Dutch school” (see [[Cerasuolo 2019]]).

                  The Transfer: Ancient Testimonies and Dangerous Practices
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Another important aspect of the caution shown by the museum
                  administration concerns the practice of transfer, which was
                  consciously avoided in the nineteenth century in the Museo
                  Borbonico thanks to the awareness of its dangers. We find a
                  clear testimony of this in a document dated 1810: Michele
                  Arditi strongly opposed Paolino Girgenti, who wanted to
                  transfer the <em>Strage degli Innocenti</em> by Andrea
                  Vaccaro, in order to eliminate the imperfection caused by the
                  seam joining the two pieces of canvas ([[D’Alconzo and Prisco
                  2005|, 84]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The practice of transfer was carried out very early in Naples,
                  since at least the eighteenth century. In 1742, Bernardo De
                  Dominici recounted the skill of two Neapolitan artists, Nicolò
                  di Simone and Alessandro Majello, who specialized in the
                  transfer of flaking paintings on panel onto canvas supports
                  ([[De Dominici [1742–43] 2003–14|, 796, 994]], cited in
                  [[Conti 2007|, 140]]).

                  The restoration of a painting by Fedele Fischetti,
                  <em>Noli Me Tangere</em>, from the church of Santa Caterina da
                  Siena ([<strong>fig. 5.7a</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-7)),
                  in 1998,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  enabled us to examine a material example of a partial transfer
                  procedure, probably carried out by the artist himself during
                  the execution of the painting, which can be traced back to
                  1766–1767. There are documents that refer to Fischetti’s
                  activity as a restorer ([[Nappi 1984|, 320]]), but in this
                  case it was possible to verify the procedure carried out long
                  ago directly on a painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Observation in raking light before restoration showed a clear
                  difference in the surface of the whole lower part of the
                  painting, which was smoother and more adherent to the canvas,
                  while in the upper part, lifting of the poorly adhering paint
                  layers was visible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting appeared to have been lined a long time ago, and
                  the adhesion of the lining canvas was no longer effective. But
                  when the restorer proceeded to remove the lining canvas, she
                  realized that in reality only the lower part retained the
                  original canvas, while in the upper part the pictorial layers
                  were glued directly to the canvas applied during the old
                  restoration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Evidently—probably following an accident—the painter had
                  needed to restore his own painting, which was adhering poorly
                  to the canvas. He had then removed the canvas from the
                  affected part and glued to it a new canvas of a very similar
                  weave to the original, while throughout the lower part he had
                  continued the gluing over the earlier canvas, where it had not
                  been necessary to remove it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The fact that the intervention had been carried out by the
                  artist himself is deduced from the nature of the canvas and
                  from the fact that the gaps in the upper part are filled with
                  an oily mixture quite similar to the original, applied from
                  the back—underneath the lining canvas—and the color applied on
                  the front over these fillings is similar to the original in
                  the handling of the brushstrokes and color scheme, but
                  slightly obscured in these areas. [<strong>Fig. 5.7b</strong>](file:///Users/edunigan/GitHub/conserving-canvas/original-text-files/transmittal-files/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/5-Cerasuolo/Cerasuolo/fig-5-7)
                  shows the areas affected by these “integrations.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The practice of transfer—often claimed by restorers to be a
                  secret capable of saving deteriorated paintings—causes more
                  problems than it solves, as is now well understood. Although
                  in the nineteenth century it was banned during restoration in
                  the Real Museo Borbonico, it was unfortunately no longer
                  avoided in the early twentieth century. In the years leading
                  up to the 1960s, the transfer of easel paintings was
                  considered a way of giving paintings greater durability (much
                  like the <em>strappo</em> technique used with frescoes), so
                  much so that it was also approved by rigorous ministerial
                  circulars, and indeed it was practiced repeatedly, with
                  questionable results. If the operation could have been carried
                  out without very serious consequences for Neapolitan
                  seventeenth-century paintings, which are characterized by
                  remarkably thick and compact preparatory layers—(although even
                  there it actually impoverished the paint layer and its
                  texture), in other cases the consequences of these
                  interventions were truly deleterious. This was the case with
                  Titian’s <em>Paolo III col Camauro.</em> Titian famously
                  painted directly onto lightly prepared canvas, and
                  <em>Paolo III</em> was seriously damaged by the transfer
                  carried out by Stanislao Troiano in 1932 ([[A. Cerasuolo
                  2013|, 197]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the first half of the twentieth century, Pasquale
                  Chiariello and his sons Umberto and Raffaele also carried out
                  many transfers (not always with positive results), while they
                  successfully continued the activities of the family business
                  and extending them to all “restoration”
                  operations—perpetuating the traditional practice of flour
                  paste lining ([[Cerasuolo 2007|, 41]]).

                  The Twentieth Century: The Experience of Antonio De Mata
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Finally, in the second half of the twentieth century,
                  improvements to traditional lining techniques with
                  <em>colla pasta</em> (glue paste) were developed by Antonio De
                  Mata ([[Cerasuolo 2008|, 40–42]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                  De Mata personally took care of the lining and the cleaning
                  and restoration. In his vision, structural conservation was
                  not a subordinate phase but together with the other phases of
                  conservation/restoration contributed to the aesthetic recovery
                  of the materiality of a work. He developed a temporary
                  stretcher with adjustable tie-rods that allowed a canvas’s
                  tension to be controlled by loosening and tightening as
                  necessary. He also devised a procedure for the preventive
                  consolidation of paintings on canvas. After freeing the
                  surface from dust and foreign matter, animal glue was
                  gradually applied on the back, in several stages, if
                  necessary, keeping the canvas fixed at the edges. This
                  procedure, which was completed by ironing the painting from
                  the back, reduced the risks of humidity and allowed the
                  improvement of the surface of the paint film without damaging
                  its material qualities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The procedure is particularly suitable for solving the
                  conservation problems of Neapolitan paintings on canvas of the
                  seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with their thick, rigid
                  preparation layers. Indeed, the animal glues and
                  flour—materials that have always been used for preparing
                  canvases before applying the oil ground and the oil-bound
                  paint layers (see [[Cerasuolo 2017|, 240–41]]; [[Véliz 1982,
                  50–51]]), are highly compatible with the original ones, and
                  are able to effectively consolidate old master paintings on
                  canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Comparing the condition of many paintings in the Capodimonte
                  Museum that have been lined in the last fifty years—as well as
                  documented and continuously monitored—makes it possible to
                  evaluate the positive outcome of these linings over time. In
                  many cases this method continues to be effective, and some
                  restorers who learned directly from De Mata and continued his
                  practice, can still teach us much about the behavior of
                  materials and intervention techniques. To preserve a
                  testimony, a meeting was organized in January 2014: an
                  interview with the restorers of that generation, recording
                  their memories and observations, in order to capture a
                  tradition that has been too often left unrecorded.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  The recovery of these procedures, insofar as they can be
                  effective and safe, will hopefully be a task and a legacy of
                  the new generations.

                  The Russian school of oil painting conservation has come a
                  long way since the 1960s—from applying only traditional
                  structural treatment techniques with water-based adhesives to
                  accepting modern approaches and synthetic polymer materials.
                  This article is devoted to the milestones achieved during this
                  process. Transformation of traditional lining methods is
                  discussed, including changes in procedure and formulations.
                  The paper also covers the development of less invasive
                  conservation techniques (such as tear mending, sizing, and
                  hydrophobization) and putting them into practice.

                <p>
                  The tradition of Russian conservation officially started in
                  1743, when the German artist Lucas Conrad Pfandzelt came to
                  Saint Petersburg to care for the royal painting gallery.
                  During the first decades of its existence, conservators
                  established main principles that were retained for about two
                  centuries. One of these was sticking to a complex structural
                  treatment that would always include such serious interventions
                  as transferring paintings from their original supports and, of
                  course, lining ([[Alyoshin 1989|, 55]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  For a very long time after the October Socialist Revolution of
                  1917, conservation in Russia developed in isolation from the
                  rest of the world. With the beginning of the thaw period in
                  Soviet culture (from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s) the
                  sphere of heritage preservation experienced significant
                  evolution, and the restoration community started to wander
                  away from techniques developed in the nineteenth century. In
                  1957, with the founding of the All-Union Central Research
                  Laboratory for Conservation and Restoration of Museum
                  Valuables,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  conservation science in Russia gained impetus; however, it was
                  not until the 1960s that conservators of easel paintings were
                  able to access professional literature and scientific events
                  from abroad to learn about methods used in current practice by
                  their foreign colleagues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These developments coincided with the advances in the chemical
                  industry—all of which set the stage for big changes in the
                  conservation field in Russia. Analyzing professional
                  scientific journals published in GOSNIIR in the 1960s,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  we can see a deep interest in chemical research into the
                  objects. The use of new synthetic materials for consolidation,
                  the study of biocide agents, and the use of new conservation
                  equipment such as vacuum hot tables were discussed. During
                  this period worldwide experience was collected and evaluated.
                  Some of the journal issues were devoted solely to reviewing
                  specialized essays for museum conservation professionals.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the 1960s to the 1980s, Soviet conservators reviewed,
                  created, and adapted structural conservation techniques, some
                  of which were considered to be a quantum leap in our country.
                  At that time, the most flourishing branch was on the track of
                  choosing noninvasive methods (as they were understood then).
                  Despite some new approaches introduced to the professional
                  community during the Greenwich conference on comparative
                  lining techniques ([[Villers 2003b]]), Soviet conservators
                  would not turn away from natural materials and traditional
                  methods. But the aim to make treatments less invasive and more
                  reversible triggered a significant number of research
                  projects. Such operations as tear mending, consolidation of
                  the flaking paint layer, and improvement of deformations were
                  reconceived in order to avoid dipping canvases in collagen
                  adhesives and to delay lining for as long as possible.

                  Transformations of Traditional Lining Technique
                </h2>
                <p>
                  From the beginning of 1960s until the mid-1980s, attention was
                  particularly given to the traditional lining technique. A lot
                  of experiments were undertaken to work out best recipes
                  ([[Lelekova 1966|, 107–8]]) or to pick plasticizers.
                  Historically, natural honey was used for this purpose, but its
                  effects and properties in lining compounds were always
                  questioned. In 1960, research on different lining adhesives
                  was published in which specialists from State Central Arts and
                  Conservation Studios<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  discussed shrinkage of sturgeon glue films, both pure and with
                  added different plasticizers. As a result of their
                  experiments, the authors proposed using polyvinyl alcohol with
                  glycerin, as these materials guarantee a more predictable
                  effect, whereas the plasticizing properties of honey were
                  considered insignificant and very much dependent on the amount
                  of sucrose in its composition ([[Trostyanskaya, Tomashevich,
                  and Sorokina 1960|, 181–82]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, the results of this research were not widely applied
                  in practice. New instructions and publications would still
                  recommend that conservators use compounds for lining made up
                  of different proportions of sturgeon glue and honey. For
                  example, Margarita Alekseyeva and Zinaida Tcherkasova in an
                  article on aqueous lining solutions mention all the known
                  drawbacks of sturgeon glue–honey compounds but still include
                  the recipes in their guidelines ([[Alekseyeva and Tcherkasova
                  1968|, 19–21]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The authors offer two practical methods of performing the
                  process of lining canvases. The first is based on a recipe
                  with a 1:1 ratio of honey to the dry sturgeon glue, by weight.
                  It suggests that the lining canvas be glued three times: the
                  first two with a 4%–8% solution and the third with an 8%–10%
                  solution. All three layers of glue should be dried in
                  sequence. The original canvas is covered with a 3%–6% water
                  solution of sturgeon glue with honey. After it dries, a second
                  layer of 8%–10% solution is applied. And as this second layer
                  becomes tacky, the two canvases are joined, evenly pressed
                  together, and ironed using warm and cold irons alternately
                  until the condensed moisture stops being released.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second method is based on a recipe with 2:1 ratio of dry
                  sturgeon glue to honey, again by weight. The lining canvas is
                  prepared with two layers of warm 6%–8% solution of sturgeon
                  glue and honey. The original canvas of the painting is infused
                  with the same compound from one to five times, with each layer
                  being allowed to dry between coats. Before the lining
                  procedure, both canvases would be infused with a 12%–17%
                  solution prepared in a proportion of 2–3:1 of dry sturgeon
                  glue and honey, respectively. As the layers on both canvases
                  become tacky, they are joined evenly and left to dry in a
                  vertical position for three to six hours. After that, the
                  canvases are ironed using warm and cold irons alternately
                  until the condensed moisture stops being released
                  ([[Alekseyeva and Tcherkasova 1968|, 22]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Several years later these methods and their variations were
                  included by Ivan Gorin and Zinaida Tcherkasova in chapter of a
                  text for art colleges teaching conservation; it remained the
                  most popular guide to practical restoration for at least 20
                  years ([[Gorin and Tcherkasova 1977|, 126]]). Interestingly,
                  it also has chapters on structural treatments with wax-resin
                  adhesives that were already falling out of practice by that
                  time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1974, Larissa Yashkina made a presentation at Greenwich
                  conference, basing her speech on a variation of the first
                  method described above, though she offered slightly different
                  formulations of the lining compounds and gave more technical
                  details about the procedure ([[Yashkina 2003]]). It was a more
                  common method at that time, and considered to be more
                  reliable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Further investigations on sturgeon-glue lining compounds were
                  conducted in 1970s and 1980s. In 1975, Roza Yabrova presented
                  a paper discussing some new materials for plasticizing
                  sturgeon glue ([[Yabrova 1975]]). Her comparative research
                  showed that such additives as polyethylene glycol (trade name
                  PEG 600), carbamide, and sorbitol could replace natural honey,
                  without all its problems and drawbacks. But traditions seem to
                  extremely strong among the Russian conservators, as none of
                  these materials were adopted in standard practice, so later
                  research continued to focus on sturgeon-honey solutions—as
                  well as concentrating on solving the problem of collagen glues
                  being prone to biodeterioration ([[Nazarova 1984]]; [[Nazarova
                  and Potapov 1984]]; [[Rebrikova 2013]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nowadays traditional lining technique is still one of the most
                  common methods of consolidation of original canvas supports of
                  the paintings. But during the past ten years there has been a
                  significant change in the whole procedure. First of all,
                  sturgeon has become an endangered species in Russia—since 2013
                  it has been protected by a federal law that limits sturgeon
                  fishing and processing. The State Research Institute for
                  Restoration has studied rabbit-skin glue an as alternative to
                  sturgeon glue and came to the conclusion that if used in
                  less-concentrated solutions, rabbit-skin glue can be
                  successfully applied to consolidate paint and ground layers
                  and also used for lining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>

                  Moreover, there is now a trend toward reducing the amount of
                  additives in the lining compounds. As the storage and exhibit
                  conditions in Russian museums have generally become more
                  stable—with balanced temperature and humidity—there is no need
                  to add biocides and plasticizers during each treatment. Case
                  studies demonstrate good results for paintings that were
                  treated with collagen glue solutions without honey
                  ([[Alyoshkina 2015]]; [[Voronina 2019]]; [[Yurovetskaya
                  2016]]).

                  Treatments to Postpone Lining
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In the 1970s and 1980s, leading studios and institutions
                  evolved new methods of preserving linen canvases that are
                  still widely used in conservation practice in Russia. One of
                  the most vivid examples is a tear-mending technique developed
                  at the State Research Institute for Restoration (GOSNIIR) in
                  the 1970s that is still widely used by conservators throughout
                  the country ([[Surovov and Yashkina 1979]]). It suggests that
                  tears and cuts of the textile painting supports are treated
                  with 5% solution of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) in ethanol or
                  isopropanol. Saturated threads are interwoven and after drying
                  are fixed using a hot spatula. This adhesive has been widely
                  used in conservation practice in Russia since 1950s
                  ([[Rumyantsev 1953]]), especially for treating murals,
                  ceramics, and fabric painting supports. Its glass transition
                  temperature (Tg) is approximately 60°C–70°C. “PVB films are
                  resistant to light and heat-sealable at temperatures above
                  120°C.…PVB films are noted for their biostable and abrasion
                  resistance properties as well as for good colorfastness
                  against ultraviolet light, low static generation, and low
                  water absorbtion” ([[Sannikova 2018|, 106]]). In 2008, the
                  tear-mending technique was slightly extended by adjusting the
                  method for strip-lining two-sided paintings to avoid overlaps
                  of new margins over the paint layer ([[Yashkina and Churakova
                  2013]]). The working procedure has also slightly changed.
                  Following a general trend holding that less is more,
                  conservators tend to use less adhesive for the process:
                  instead of saturating canvas around the tears, they just apply
                  it to the direct spots.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A method of stabilizing canvases by starch sizing was
                  introduced by conservators of the Tretyakov gallery and came
                  into common practice as a procedure for conserving canvas
                  ([[Yushkevich 1995]]). The technique was first developed in
                  1970s but was not published until the mid-1990s, being
                  constantly improved in the interim by its author, Galina
                  Yushkevich.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before performing the operation, the picture must be stretched
                  on paper margins; the painting layer should be fully covered
                  by the facing. These precautions guarantee that the canvas of
                  the painting is kept from shrinking during treatment, which
                  involves heat and moisture. Afterwards, the painting is put
                  face down on a flannel or a woven felt to protect the impasto.
                  Sizing is performed by applying a 10% starch paste on the
                  reverse of the picture and spreading it evenly. After the
                  paste dries a little it is delicately removed with a palette
                  knife. The small amount of remaining starch is pressed with a
                  warm iron. This causes the residue of the paste to be absorbed
                  into the structure of the picture, which helps reduce canvas
                  deformations and makes the support less responsive to changes
                  in temperature and humidity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This method is also very effective for removing deformations,
                  so it was adopted by many conservators and is still widely
                  used in many studios. However, during the past few years this
                  method has been reevaluated. Saturating canvas with starch
                  ultimately makes the linen fibers more brittle and prone to
                  microbiological damage. Nowadays cellulose ethers are mostly
                  substituted for the starch; this also functions to better
                  adsorb dust and glue residues from the canvas ([[Churakova,
                  Karasyova, and Yurovetskaya 2018, 56]]), but such total
                  saturation of fabric support is still questionable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the late 1980s, another interesting technique used to
                  stabilize canvas supports was introduced by GOSNIIR:
                  hydrophobization of textile supports with solutions of
                  organosilicons in isopropanol or refined gasoline
                  ([[Malachevskaya and Yashkina 1986]]). Two coats of a 5%
                  solution of polymethylhydrosiloxane are applied by brushing or
                  spraying onto the reverse side of the picture sixty minutes
                  apart. This coats the textile fibers and reduces the canvas’s
                  response to changes in temperature and humidity. The process
                  of polymerization is usually finished after eight to ten days
                  of exposure, when the solvent evaporates. The properties of
                  organosilicons (such as polymethylhydrosiloxane) still allow
                  for later protein glue treatments, including sturgeon glue
                  linings ([[Fedoseeva 1999, 68–69]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Evaluating methods of hydrophobization of canvases with
                  solutions of organosilicons seems to be a more complicated
                  task for now. All tests performed with the samples showed very
                  good results. According to publications on the project,
                  treated canvases quickly repel surface moisture, do not get
                  wet, are not prone to shrinkage and deformation, and withstand
                  sharp increases in humidity ([[Nazarova, Malachevskaya, and
                  Yashkina 1990]]). Moreover, the air and vapor permeability of
                  canvases did not change ([[Malachevskaya and Yashkina 2013]]).
                  However, when this treatment was applied to the paintings, it
                  turned out that on some artworks the consolidation operations
                  with water-based solutions were not as effective as they were
                  on the untreated with organosilicon objects. Moreover, the
                  process of degradation of polymethylhydrosiloxane is still to
                  be investigated.

                <p>
                  We did not have an industry dedicated to conservation products
                  in the former Soviet Union, nor do we currently have one in
                  Russia. None of the polymers that have been studied, tested,
                  and applied were produced specifically for conservation
                  purposes; all of them were created for the production sector
                  and then adapted to conservation needs. In the 1990s, not only
                  the political but also the economic life of our country
                  underwent serious changes after the collapse of the Soviet
                  Union. Many manufacturers either closed or changed production
                  technology, afterwards offering new materials to the market.
                  At the same time, importation of European and American
                  conservation materials started to grow, so people working in
                  the conservation and restoration sphere suddenly had a broad
                  selection of totally new polymers to get acquainted with.
                  Consequently, the beginning of the new period in Russian
                  history started with a lot of experimentation, comparative
                  work, and research in the conservation field. Specialists
                  returned to the international conservation community,
                  attending conferences and scientific seminars and learning
                  more about the work of their foreign colleagues. At this time
                  a lot of tests were also established, including those on
                  materials for structural conservation of canvases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  GOSNIIR conducted comparative research on three acrylic
                  dispersions: Lascaux 498&nbsp;HV (Lascaux Colours &amp; Restauro)
                  was compared to two adhesives originally produced in Russia
                  for coated paper and textile manufacturing. The first has the
                  trade name ABV1B and is a copolymer of butyl acrylate,
                  methacrylic acid, and vinyl acetate. The second has the trade
                  name AK-243 and is a copolymer of ethyl acrylate, methacrylic
                  acid, vinyl acetate, and acrylonitrile. Both have a working
                  concentration of up to 50% ([[Fedoseeva et al. 2016|, 98–99}
                  no perms doc +}). All three dispersions meet the general
                  requirements for a strip-lining adhesive: to not penetrate
                  deeply into the threads of the canvas, not cause shrinkage of
                  the canvas, have a high adhesive capacity, and form a film
                  with elasticity that persists over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Results of the comparative analysis showed that the AK-243 and
                  ABV-1B dispersions are superior to the Lascaux adhesive on a
                  number of indicators; in particular, they penetrate less into
                  the threads of the canvas and do not cause shrinkage
                  ([[Fedoseeva, Malachevskaya, and Yashkina 1997]]).
                  Nevertheless, today the most popular adhesives for
                  strip-lining are Beva products (Beva&nbsp;371 Film or Beva D-8
                  Dispersion) and Lascaux 498&nbsp;HV ([[Romanova 2019]]). This
                  popularity is despite the fact that both AK-243 and ABV-1B are
                  still produced in Russia: manufacturers sell them only in
                  industrial-scale volumes and retailers are not interested in
                  organizing packaging the products in smaller sizes,
                  conservators have problems obtaining them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following international trends, in the 1990s, the Russian
                  conservation community started to familiarize itself with
                  synthetic materials for lining and to compare them with
                  traditional techniques ([[Fedoseeva 1998]]). There were also
                  some intentions to develop or adapt Russian synthetic polymers
                  for the lining process.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  In the end, an understanding that the most common sturgeon
                  glue lining has obvious drawbacks and is not suitable for all
                  artworks led to adopting a method for treating oil paintings
                  that has been well known for lining textiles since the 1970s,
                  when it was introduced at the Pranas Gudynas Centre for
                  Restoration in Lithuania.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The method employs an acrylic adhesive with the trade name
                  A-45-K, which is a copolymer of vinyl acetate, butyl acrylate,
                  and acrylic acid in ethyl acetate ({Emelyanov 2004}). In a
                  form of either a dispersion or acetone solution, it can be
                  brushed or sprayed on a lining cloth and later activated by
                  temperature ([[Semechkina 1993|, 125]]). Its properties are in
                  many ways similar to Plextol and Lascaux adhesives, but
                  choosing a local manufacturer was preferred in the 1970s, not
                  only to support the country’s economy but also because this
                  particular material was well-known and tested. A-45-K has not
                  become very popular for standard lining procedures for
                  canvases, but it showed good results in a few specific case
                  studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One example is the lining support of the eighteenth century
                  painting
                  <em>Conclusions of Field Marshall General Count B.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Minikh on
                    the Seizure of Ochakov</em>” ([<strong>figs. 6.1a and b</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/6-Yurovetsksya/fig-6-1))
                  ([[Iurovetskaia et al. 2019]]). Silk was used as a support
                  ([<strong>fig. 6.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/6-Yurovetsksya/fig-6-2)),
                  and the image layer combined oil, gold paint, and ink.
                  Adhesive A-45-K dissolved in acetone was sprayed on the
                  surface of the lining cloth ([<strong>fig. 6.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/6-Yurovetsksya/fig-6-3))
                  and after matching with the original support was activated
                  locally by heat ([<strong>figs. 6.4a and b</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/6-Yurovetsksya/fig-6-4)).
                  Effective application of A-45-K for this art piece still has
                  not led to widespread adoption of this technique among
                  professional conservators because, since 2006, when this
                  method was first introduced for lining the Mikhail Vrubel
                  painting <em>Gwydon</em> on a sackcloth support, it has become
                  increasingly complicated to buy the material from the
                  manufacturers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nowadays, restoration professionals in Russia often face
                  difficulty accessing materials adapted for conservation
                  purposes in our country and thus turn to reliable professional
                  materials by internationally known suppliers. In this way, the
                  conservation field in Russia is experiencing globalization,
                  with all its challenges and opportunities, and mostly sticking
                  to materials and techniques that are used worldwide. This
                  certainly makes our work more comfortable, but it also
                  eliminates distinctions between different conservation schools
                  with their unique methods and approaches.

                <p>
                  In his essay “Three Days that Changed Conservation,” David
                  Bomford reflected upon the circumstances surrounding the 1974
                  Conference on Comparative Lining Techniques and its status as
                  an important inflection point in the history of paintings
                  conservation: “It was the beginning of a new precision, a new
                  refinement, and it heralded a new technical intelligence in
                  targeting conservation treatments …. Greenwich was when
                  conservation came of age” ([[Bomford 2017|, 1]]). What
                  followed was a proliferation of approaches to treatment,
                  coincident adoption of new materials, and a need for
                  supportive fundamental and practical research.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The past forty-five years have seen technical refinements of
                  traditional methods, changes in the ways that conservators
                  communicate the nuances of structural treatment, engineering
                  of new purpose-built equipment for lining and alternatives to
                  lining, development of new approaches to lining, changes in
                  material formulations, adoption of sophisticated research
                  instrumentation, and increased international exchange of
                  information. While the advances have been numerous, the
                  challenges ahead are equally numerous and increasingly
                  formidable. This paper attempts to anticipate some of these
                  significant challenges and to provide a framework for
                  sustainable collaborative efforts to address future
                  difficulties.

                  The Current State of Terminology
                </h2>
                <p>
                  One of the efforts of the Greenwich conference proceedings was
                  the production of a handbook of terms used in the lining of
                  paintings—an attempt to define about three hundred terms so
                  that conservators from different countries and different
                  lining traditions and philosophies could communicate
                  effectively. This handbook was reproduced for subsequent
                  conferences and seminars, and it is included as a glossary in
                  the volume republished nearly 20 years ago ([[Villers
                  2003b]]). Despite the handbook’s status as a key resource in
                  the training of paintings conservators, and despite
                  international efforts to standardize terminology in the realm
                  of conservation of cultural heritage,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Cecil Krarup Andersen found in 2012 that the frequency of
                  deviations from terminology established in the Greenwich
                  Handbook increased with the passage of time in
                  English-language publications included in AATA ([[Andersen
                  2012]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The reasons behind these deviations are many. Given the
                  adoption of English as a lingua franca in conservation
                  literature, Andersen and others have noted the persistence of
                  English cognates in different lining traditions, resulting in
                  a collection of terms having essentially the same meaning:
                  lining, relining, doubling, and redoubling, for example.
                  Additionally, the introduction of new materials and innovative
                  approaches to treatment have given rise to adjustments to
                  classical terminology and the creation of new terms and
                  variants. Further confusion can result from techniques falling
                  under umbrella terms while being fundamentally different
                  procedures. For example, the thread-by-thread tear-mending
                  techniques first described by Winfried Heiber ([[Heiber
                  2003]]), and adapted by Petra Demuth and others, have
                  influenced the development of various bridging and reweaving
                  techniques for the stabilization and reestablishment of
                  tension in torn supports. Of the two, reweaving may be more
                  consistent with Heiber’s approach, yet both approaches may be
                  described as thread-by-thread tear mending or a modified
                  Heiber technique.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One might suggest that our terminology has sprawled due to the
                  lack of an explicit, unified imperative for international
                  consistency. Inconsistent terminology may be cause for alarm;
                  however, this “problem” is a natural consequence of parallel
                  research and practical innovation that leverages the material
                  traditions of varied regional practice. The expansion of our
                  shared lexicon and authors’ apparent agency to redefine
                  accepted terminology suggests that the international community
                  has engaged in rapid adoption of new techniques and materials
                  to such a degree that flexibility has been valued over rigid
                  language structures. To stifle experimental creativity by
                  imposing specific linguistic constraints could strip some of
                  the nuance from technical descriptions of practical
                  applications—particularly if those communications originate
                  from outside of English-speaking traditions. If the trajectory
                  of modern structural treatment is founded upon flexible
                  decision-making trees—an intentional move away from
                  prescriptive treatment—then it is imperative that paintings
                  conservators aim to embrace and understand the breadth of
                  traditions and techniques that exist internationally.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  In the current global environment, with its mounting
                  uncertainties due to climate change, political unrest, and
                  public health crises, and given the limited resources
                  allocated to the conservation of cultural heritage,
                  conservators must seek out opportunities to create efficient
                  practices. Shared knowledge, sustained longitudinal research,
                  and the ability to anticipate future material challenges will
                  have increased value in the decades ahead. Our best shot for
                  rising to these demands is through international
                  collaboration.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Of course, conservators must be able to communicate the
                  technical aspects of their work with precision and clarity,
                  and we must be willing to make nuanced adjustments to our
                  terminology with the accumulation of scientific,
                  philosophical, and practical information—shifting away from
                  idealistic “reversibility” in favor of the practical
                  “retreatability,” and gaining a more granular understanding of
                  increased transparency of oil paint films ([[Van Loon 2008]])
                  due to deterioration processes and through structural
                  intervention ([[Froment 2019]]), for example. Although the
                  adoption of English as the operating language imposes some
                  structure for a shared terminology, doing so also inhibits the
                  participation and investment of experts globally, and we risk
                  the erosion of nuance with each translation. If conservators
                  embrace international collaboration as a benchmark of
                  sustainable practice,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  we will increase the probability of discovering new insights
                  and relationships among differing international (and
                  intergenerational) practices.

                  This initiative would be a significant undertaking building
                  upon and necessarily superseding efforts such as the Greenwich
                  conference handbook of terms and the LMCR project spearheaded
                  by the Associazone Giovanni Secco Suardo;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  however, the benefits and potential efficiencies should be
                  apparent to the reader, and the greater understanding and
                  respect for traditions and innovations outside of the English
                  language would help to build a more inclusive international
                  community.

                  While parallels to medical fields might suggest that
                  conservators should adopt a standardized lexicon, so much of
                  the variation in our work is influenced by geography—the
                  materials and techniques employed by the artist, the
                  environmental conditions to which the painting has been
                  subjected, and historical regional restoration practices—that
                  a monolithic definition of best practice is neither reasonable
                  nor sustainable. Rather, adopting a multilingual,
                  multiregional approach to terminology would ensure that our
                  common knowledge does not suffer an erosion of empirical
                  nuance.

                  Our terminology is only as good as our ability to fully
                  understand the material demands of a treatment, and our
                  ability to execute effective treatments depends on accurate
                  heuristics and decision-making as well as appropriate use of
                  purpose-built equipment. Each of these parameters is developed
                  and delineated through fundamental and practical research. Our
                  understanding of material properties and environmental
                  response, the development of technologies and equipment in
                  support of treatment refinements, and the evaluation of
                  treatment procedures all require collaboration between
                  conservators and scientists. Scientists ensure that research
                  methodologies are sound, and that the interpretation of data
                  holds scientific merit, and conservators ultimately decide how
                  applicable the scientific research is to their daily practice,
                  wherein conservators sort materials and techniques
                  qualitatively (e.g., “weak” versus “strong” and “sympathetic”
                  versus “invasive,” for example) for specific use cases.

                  Expanding Publication of “Ordinary” Treatments
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Research only gets us so far toward understanding structural
                  treatment. Ultimately, hands-on experimentation, practical
                  treatment, and object-level study are supported by fundamental
                  and practical research. A conservator’s ability to recalibrate
                  their heuristic understanding of treatment options relies upon
                  an accumulation of data: experiential, anecdotal, and peer
                  reviewed. Unfortunately for everyday practice, the
                  conservation treatment literature is overwhelmingly geared
                  toward the extraordinary: iconic paintings, material
                  curiosities, and technical challenges. It can be difficult for
                  a conservator to know when a project or observation is
                  appropriate for or worthy of publication. Thoughts that this
                  treatment is not interesting enough for publication or this
                  painting is not important enough for publication are
                  counterproductive in the long term, resulting in collective
                  blind spots in the conservation literature.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A more sustainable and collaborative approach to this problem
                  would be to encourage the publication of seemingly routine
                  data about methods of manufacture and treatment procedures,
                  either making room within established scholarly spaces or
                  supporting new publication venues devoted to communications of
                  “routine” treatments. This is an uncomfortable thought,
                  however, for some practitioners and institutions, especially
                  in the realm of conservation of modern and contemporary
                  materials, wherein confidentiality is often key to the
                  conservator-client (and conservator-client-dealer-foundation)
                  relationship. We cannot expect colleagues to jeopardize their
                  working relationships, but we should not feel satisfied by a
                  discourse illustrated with redacted images and presentation
                  slides with do-not-tweet warnings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A reasonable compromise that would provide some degree of
                  confidentiality while enabling the aggregation of treatment
                  data would be to encourage periodic publication of treatments
                  within an institution or private practice over the course of
                  five to ten years. These summaries would overcome the
                  misconception that individual treatments may not be worthy of
                  publication, while tracking adoption and use of techniques and
                  materials. Moreover, such publications would provide
                  opportunities to discuss successes and shortcomings of
                  treatments both ordinary and extraordinary. Lastly, this
                  initiative would generate opportunities for conservators to
                  think critically about their work and how their philosophies
                  evolve over time. In sum, a critical mass of such publications
                  would provide enough information to allow the field to better
                  describe use boundaries among different structural treatment
                  options in different exhibition and storage environments. Of
                  course, this proposal hinges upon the support of existing
                  editorial boards and/or the foundation of one or more new
                  journals.

                  Increasing Practitioners’ Command of Diverse Treatment
                  Methodologies
                </h3>
                <p>
                  An outgrowth of the production of a new international
                  terminology and broader publication of practical treatment
                  information (and indeed, of the Conserving Canvas initiative)
                  should be the increase of conservators’ capacity for
                  understanding and commanding multiple approaches for
                  structural treatment. The past few decades have seen a
                  proliferation of new cleaning technologies aimed at greater
                  specificity, efficacy ([[Ormsby et al. 2010]]), control
                  ([[Tauber et al. 2018]]), and increased safety to the
                  practitioner.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  Yet the same demand for specificity in structural treatment is
                  seemingly lacking; a paintings conservator might be expected
                  to utilize only a few structural treatment procedures each for
                  humidification, consolidation, tear mending, and lining. One
                  goal of modern structural treatment should be to work toward
                  the understanding of and proficiency in multiple techniques to
                  service different needs and to achieve differing effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ways in which we describe treatment parameters can be
                  expanded by considering varied approaches. For instance, a
                  more nuanced understanding of treatment possibilities makes it
                  possible to better define one’s intent with a treatment:
                  whether or not adhesive methods are required, and if they are,
                  where within the structure of the painting one aims to
                  localize the adhesive bond, and what is intended for the
                  method of retreatability. From there, the choice of materials
                  and the ability to control the conditions imposed upon the
                  painting during treatment determines (in part) the success at
                  realizing the intent of the treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An individual conservator, a training program, and a museum
                  might have their own proficiencies when it comes to structural
                  treatment; by relying upon each other, we are able to fill in
                  knowledge gaps and develop formal and informal advisory groups
                  to guide individual treatments and long-term practical
                  advancement. An ancillary benefit of gaining proficiencies
                  across several different types of structural treatment is an
                  increased ability to adapt when working in nonideal conditions
                  or when material formulations change.

                  Material Sustainability and Probable Impacts on Structural
                  Treatment
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In recent years, sustainability has transformed from a
                  buzzword to an urgent concern. Increased focus has been placed
                  upon material sourcing, with specific attention paid to
                  materials refined from petroleum and other nonrenewable
                  resources. Other key factors in material sustainability are
                  environmental impact (how a material influences the stability
                  of various biomes) and human health and safety (how chronic
                  and acute exposures affect organ function and how materials
                  metabolize and bioaccumulate within the body). One consequence
                  of pursuing sustainable materials and practices is the
                  greening of our chemistry, either by choice or through
                  governmental regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of the various regulatory frameworks worldwide, the European
                  Union’s Regulation, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction
                  of Chemicals (REACH) is a good predictor of materials to which
                  conservators might lose access in the near future.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  Under REACH is a list of substances of very high concern
                  (SVHC): a register of chemicals that are deemed problematic
                  and have been proposed for restricted use or other
                  regulations. Suppliers and manufacturers can receive
                  authorizations to formulate substances containing restricted
                  materials; however, if a manufacturer were to find a
                  substitute chemical that performs similarly while being
                  unrestricted, there is a strong likelihood that the
                  formulation of the substance will change. For the purposes of
                  structural treatment, conservators need to be aware of the
                  current formulations of our common materials and the chemical
                  similarities between components of conservation materials and
                  those on the SVHC list.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the number of changes to paintings conservation
                  practice resulting from governmental regulations should be
                  low, there are examples of anticipated changes that are of
                  significant concern. Phthalates feature in general on the SVHC
                  list,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  mostly because of the risk of oral exposure due to the
                  presence of phthalate plasticizers in children’s toys and in
                  plastic bottles. The most common occurrence of phthalates in
                  paintings conservation is in the formulation of Beva 371 and
                  Beva 371b, both of which include Cellolyn 21, a phthalate
                  ester of rosin acids.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  Replacing Cellolyn 21 in the formulation of Beva products will
                  likely change the tacking, setting, and melting temperatures
                  of the adhesive.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  Phenol ethoxylates, a class of nonionic surfactants, are under
                  increasing scrutiny.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  Nonylphenol ethoxylates, for example, are restricted materials
                  under REACH, but they have been used in the past in
                  formulations of acrylic dispersions. It is likely that the
                  surfactant components of acrylic dispersions will undergo a
                  series of substitutions, possibly resulting in different
                  working properties and changes to the pH of acrylic dispersion
                  formulations. Lastly, some of our common solvents have been
                  deemed problematic, including many aromatic solvents. Any
                  restrictions placed upon these solvents could have
                  implications for reversibility of certain treatments and for
                  the feasibility of some adhesive formulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to material substitutions due to governmental
                  regulations, conservation materials extracted from threatened
                  or endangered species may not be available in the future.
                  Examples of these species include many types of sturgeon, from
                  which protein glues can be extracted, and some algae species
                  responsible for the production of agar-agar and agarose.
                  Conservators need to be aware of the possibility of
                  formulation changes. Not only do we have a moral obligation to
                  comply with regulations, but we also have an ethical
                  obligation to anticipate material changes and the impact such
                  changes may have on retreatability of current treatments.
                  Luckily, being prepared for changes in the name of
                  sustainability can be accomplished by attempting to address
                  all of the challenges highlighted above.

                <p>
                  Our ever-evolving understanding of the structural treatment of
                  paintings on fabric supports is built upon nuance and
                  experience expressed first in native tongues and shared across
                  cultures thereafter. If conservators and scientists can work
                  together to communicate effectively and efficiently, to
                  explore the limits of our current techniques, to respect the
                  expertise inherent in regional traditions, and to encourage
                  fundamental and practical research within our international
                  conservation framework, we will have followed sustainable and
                  adaptable trajectories for progress. These collaborative
                  efforts will be most effective if we avoid impulses toward
                  secrecy and proprietarianism, embrace communications detailing
                  treatments and studies, both routine and extraordinary—whether
                  they be successes or failures—and we plan ahead for conditions
                  where problematic or scarce materials need to be replaced.
                  Thus, multilingual and multiregional inclusiveness will
                  provide the field with a plurality of best practices to adopt,
                  adapt, and evolve into the future.

                  The previous conservation treatments of van Dyck’s
                  <em>Equestrian Portrait of Charles I</em> present a history of
                  lining. Having been lined with a glue-paste adhesive twice in
                  the late nineteenth century, the painting was relined with a
                  wax-resin adhesive in 1952, and in the recent treatment was
                  relined with Lascaux 375, an equivalent heat-seal adhesive to
                  Beva 371. This article describes the recent treatment,
                  starting with the removal of the wax-resin lining, and
                  includes the repairs to the original canvas and the relining,
                  which was carried out in two separate stages on a heated
                  low-pressure table while the painting was held in a vacuum
                  envelope.

                <p>
                  The <em>Equestrian Portrait of Charles I</em> by Anthony van
                  Dyck (NG 1172), painted around 1637–38, monumental in scale
                  (368 x 292.5 cm), imposingly depicts the king as the divinely
                  chosen ruler of Great Britain, celebrating the union between
                  England and Scotland following the accession of Charles’s
                  father, James I, to the throne in 1603 ([<strong>fig. 8.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-1)).
                  Van Dyck’s choice of an equestrian portrait not only
                  demonstrates the king’s horsemanship but is also deliberately
                  reminiscent of equestrian statues in Ancient Rome that were
                  intended as assertions of temporal power. It was painted
                  toward the end of a period of relative prosperity in England
                  and set in a tranquil English landscape, shortly before the
                  country was plunged into a bloody civil war in which Charles
                  lost his throne—and his head when he was executed on January
                  30, 1649. The depiction of this poignant moment in English
                  history has ensured its popularity with visitors to the
                  National Gallery and its importance within the collection.
                  Only rarely has it been taken off display, and it normally
                  hangs in Room 31, where it creates an imposing impression and
                  forms a vista to draw the public into the Gallery as they
                  enter through the Central Hall.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Van Dyck painted the portrait on a twill weave canvas with a
                  black ticking pattern, which has a central horizontal join
                  ([<strong>fig. 8.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-2));
                  it bears Charles I’s original cipher at the center of the
                  reverse. This type of canvas, commonly used for domestic
                  upholstery, was probably chosen for its strength and toughness
                  and because it could be obtained in large widths, making it an
                  attractive choice of material for large paintings. The canvas
                  was prepared with a red-brown ground followed by a thick,
                  oil-based gray priming.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The decision to fully retreat the picture in 2018 was based on
                  the fact that the lining canvas was detaching from the
                  original and the previously applied varnish and retouchings
                  had discolored significantly. All lining activity at the
                  National Gallery since the late 1970s has entailed the
                  relining of paintings—that is, the replacement of an old and
                  degraded lining with a new one. On the occasions when
                  previously unlined pictures have required structural
                  attention, less invasive forms of treatment than lining have
                  been selected. In the case of the van Dyck, the recent
                  relining was a nonimpregnating, nap-bond treatment carried out
                  with an equivalent of Beva 371, Lascaux Heat-Seal Adhesive
                  375, using a vacuum-envelope technique.

                  Early History and Ownership
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The painting’s checkered early history has affected its
                  condition. In 1650, shortly after Charles I’s execution,
                  Cromwell sold the painting to Sir Balthazar Gerbier, who
                  resold it to Gisbert van Ceulen in Antwerp, from where it was
                  sold yet again to Duke Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of
                  Bavaria and governor of the Spanish Netherlands ([[Martin
                  1972|, 44]]). In 1698, the painting was looted from Munich by
                  Emperor Joseph I, who gifted the picture to the first Duke of
                  Marlborough in 1706. From then, it remained in the UK at
                  Blenheim Palace until the National Gallery acquired it in 1885
                  for the sum of £17,500. Throughout all these changes in
                  ownership the painting would have been rolled up and
                  transported by horse and cart or by ship. The raised,
                  horizontal craquelure in the picture is indicative of the
                  painting having been rolled, as are the large number of splits
                  and losses at the sides ([<strong>fig. 8.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-3)).
                  A series of vertical of losses at the right edge also suggest
                  that the rolled canvas was tied too tightly, crushing the
                  paint in these areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since the painting entered the National Gallery’s collection
                  it has rarely travelled. During World War I the picture was
                  evacuated to Overstone Park, outside of Northampton. During
                  the Second World War, it went first to Penrhyn Castle, and
                  then in 1941 to the Manod slate mine in Wales. On both of
                  these latter occasions it was transported upright on its
                  stretcher in a large wooden case strapped to the back of a
                  lorry. On its journey to Manod the truck had to pass through a
                  tunnel that was not tall enough to accommodate the height of
                  the case. This had been anticipated, and the road had been dug
                  up beforehand to make extra height, but even so there was
                  insufficient headroom for the truck to pass through, and the
                  truck’s tires had to be deflated ([[Clark 1977|, 6]]; [[Davies
                  and Rawlins 1946|, 13]]). On its return trip to the Gallery in
                  June 1945 the painting travelled mostly by train. More
                  recently, in January 2018, the painting was lent to the Royal
                  Academy’s exhibition <em>Charles I: King and Collector</em>,
                  and it again remained on its stretcher for the short journey
                  across London.

                  Early Relining Treatments
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Before the recent treatment, which began with a cleaning in
                  June 2018, the painting had already been lined at least four
                  times; as a result, it presents a potted history of lining at
                  the Gallery. It was acquired already lined, almost certainly
                  with a glue-paste adhesive, and relined immediately after
                  acquisition with glue-paste by William Morrill, a private
                  liner who regularly undertook work for the Gallery. Morrill
                  was the second generation of a dynasty of liners renowned for
                  their tough, durable linings—which, by today’s standards,
                  often produced overly flat picture surfaces. In the case of
                  the <em>Equestrian Portrait,</em> this was achieved at the
                  expense of squashing the impasto in the picture, leaving
                  moated depressions around these areas.

                  It is worth emphasizing the durability of the Morrill family’s
                  linings, a number of which still remain on National Gallery
                  paintings, and they have stayed in a stable condition despite
                  now being around 170 years old. In 1889, however, four years
                  after his initial lining, Morrill was asked to reline the
                  painting again, because it was considered that the central
                  join protruded too much. This time he did another paste
                  relining but using two lining canvases. However, this lining
                  created further damage. Morrill cut away all the excess canvas
                  at the back of the join, and completely removed the stitching
                  in the central section as well but left the stitching intact
                  at the ends of the join. During the relining, the two original
                  pieces of canvas shrank apart, leaving a 4–5&nbsp;mm gap across the
                  center of the join, and at the points where the stitching
                  remained, the painting bulged away from the lining canvas,
                  forming large air pockets. The bulge at the left was ironed
                  flat, leaving a slight depression, but ironing the one at the
                  right created a raised crease in the original canvas and a
                  50-cm-long vertical line of paint loss. A similar crease was
                  made in the center of the bottom edge. Additionally, during
                  the lining removals that Morrill undertook, fragments of old
                  glue became trapped underneath the picture, causing holes and
                  indentations in the picture surface, mostly around the edges.

                <p>
                  By 1952, Morrill’s lining canvases had embrittled, tearing at
                  the turnover edges, and the surface of the painting had become
                  undulated. By this time the Gallery no longer used private
                  restorers, having established a conservation department in the
                  late 1940s. Arthur Lucas, who later became the Gallery’s chief
                  restorer, decided to remove Morrill’s double lining using a
                  mixture of water and ethanol to soften the glue layers, and to
                  then reline the painting with a single piece of linen adhered
                  with a wax-resin mixture (58% plain beeswax, 40% dammar resin,
                  2% stand oil) using heated hand irons. There was a vogue for
                  wax lining at the Gallery from shortly after the war until the
                  late 1970s, when it was supplanted by Beva 371. Lucas’s
                  decision to reline the picture may have been considered
                  legitimate at the time, but nowadays it might be considered
                  more appropriate to flatten the undulations and repair the
                  edges of the lining by adding a strip lining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lucas’s lining also had its problems. The water and ethanol
                  used to remove Morrill’s lining made the original canvas
                  buckle and undulate, and these problems were not addressed
                  with any flattening treatments before relining. The relining
                  was initially carried out with the painting face down, and the
                  lining canvas, stretched onto a loom and prepared with the
                  wax-resin, was placed on top of it—a standard procedure at the
                  time. The lining canvas was ironed from the reverse, lightly
                  tacking the painting to the lining, which was then turned face
                  up so that the ironing could continue over the facing tissue
                  covering the front of the picture. The temperature of the
                  irons was reduced, and the wax adhesive did not get hot enough
                  to form an even layer nor form a good bond between the two
                  canvases. The result was that the rippled undulations caused
                  during the delining remained and, due to the considerably
                  uneven distribution of wax, more pronounced lumps and bumps
                  were created in the picture surface ([<strong>fig. 8.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-4)).
                  By 2018, the painting was detaching from the lining,
                  particularly at the edges.

                  After cleaning, a template was made of the damages and
                  distortions at the front by marking these areas onto thick
                  sheets of Melinex (polyester film), so that they could be
                  accurately located on the back of the picture during the later
                  stages of the treatment.

                <p>
                  The central join was then faced with Japanese tissue adhered
                  with a wheat starch and sturgeon glue adhesive, to provide
                  extra reinforcement to this area. This was followed by an
                  overall facing of Eltoline tissue and a beeswax and dammar
                  adhesive, diluted in mineral spirit and applied cold. The
                  intention was to enable the removal of the overall facing
                  without affecting the Japanese tissue, so that the join would
                  remain reinforced during a future rolling operation when the
                  painting needed to be turned face up after the removal of the
                  wax lining from the reverse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting was taken to the relining studio and placed face
                  down on a large table covered with silicon-coated Melinex. The
                  stretcher was removed and the lining canvas peeled away in
                  strips—a relatively easy task given that the lining canvas had
                  already become detached in parts and the adhesive had become
                  weak and brittle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The bulk of the wax resin, particularly the thicker areas—up
                  to 7 or 8&nbsp;mm thick—were scraped from the back of the original
                  using sharpened metal strips, leaving a thin film of the wax
                  resin, which was then removed with scalpels (see [<strong>fig. 8.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-2)).
                  A certain amount of the wax-resin adhesive remained
                  impregnated within the original canvas, but no attempt was
                  made to extract this using solvents as the adhesive had not
                  darkened the thick oil-based red ground and gray priming
                  layers. Throughout the treatment, the center of the painting
                  was reached by kneeling on large cushioned pads.

                  Once the old lining adhesive had been removed, the repairs to
                  the canvas were carried out. The splits at the sides of the
                  canvas were repaired with Evo-Stik Resin ‘W,’ an aqueous PVA
                  adhesive. Many of the splits, as well as losses at the edges
                  and small holes in the center of the picture, required inserts
                  of new, oil-primed linen canvas adhered with the same PVA
                  adhesive and then heated with a hot spatula and placed under
                  weights until dry (see [<strong>fig. 8.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-3)).

                <p>
                  The old, hard oil-based filling material used across the join
                  was generally well adhered, and so was left in place apart
                  from small, localized sections that had cracked and needed
                  replacing with inserts of new canvas. The join was reinforced
                  at the back with a 5-cm-wide strip of Stabiltex, a thin,
                  gauze-like polyester, that was preimpregnated with Lascaux 375
                  and attached using a hot spatula.

                  Abrasions to the back of the canvas caused by the previous
                  delinings had left the red ground visible in several areas at
                  the back, and these were consolidated with an aqueous acrylic
                  adhesive, Primal B60A. The hollow areas were then filled with
                  Mowiol GE 4-86, an aqueous polyvinyl alcohol binder, mixed
                  with chalk and tinted with pigments to match the canvas color.

                <p>
                  Many of the broader undulations in the canvas had disappeared
                  with the removal of the wax resin, but some remained,
                  particularly in the central area of the picture. The entire
                  painting was given a flattening treatment by locally
                  moistening the back of the canvas and covering it with boards
                  and weights while the areas dried overnight. This was done
                  section by section, starting from the center and working out
                  toward the edges. The Melinex template made at the outset
                  proved useful in locating specific areas of distortion, such
                  as the creased areas of canvas, which were also moistened and
                  massaged flat with a hot spatula. This proved reasonably
                  successful. Attempts were also made to flatten the numerous
                  small depressions in the picture surface caused by the
                  fragments of old glue pressed into the paint surface, as well
                  as the moated depressions around areas of impasto. These
                  treatments, however, had little effect.

                  Turning the Painting Face Up
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The painting was then ready to be turned face up. It had been
                  planned to do this by rolling the painting onto a large wooden
                  roller, and then unrolling it face up. However, given the
                  number of splits and the amount of damage at the sides, there
                  was a risk that rolling might cause further splitting. It was
                  therefore decided to adhere a temporary strip lining to the
                  facing at the front of the painting so that it could be
                  attached to its stretcher and then turned over. The strip
                  lining consisted of Saatifil PES 120/41, a thin polyester
                  adhered with Beva film heat-sealed with spatulas from the back
                  of the canvas. The stretcher, fitted with a polycarbonate
                  panel, was placed over the reverse of the picture, and the
                  strip lining was then stapled to the stretcher. A further
                  polycarbonate panel was slid under the front of the painting
                  and taped around the back of the stretcher. The painting,
                  stretched onto the stretcher and sandwiched between the two
                  polycarbonate sheets, was then lifted off the table and turned
                  face up onto the table, which was covered with freshly
                  siliconed Melinex.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The stretcher, the temporary strip lining, and facings were
                  all removed, and the losses in the painting were filled with
                  Mowiol and chalk, tinted to match the color of the original
                  gray priming. Following this, the painting was slid face up
                  onto the paneled stretcher, sandwiched between the
                  polycarbonate panels and Melinex, and be set aside while the
                  lining canvas and vacuum envelope were prepared.

                  Preparation of the Lining Canvas
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The lining canvas was prepared in an upper studio, as the
                  ceiling height in the lining studio was too low to accommodate
                  the wooden loom. The canvas—a single piece of linen with
                  double warp and weft yarns—was stretched onto an expandable
                  loom and wetted and prestretched three times to reduce the
                  canvas’s potential to shrink. The final wetting was done using
                  a deacidifying solution of magnesium bicarbonate in distilled
                  water with the intention of improving the longevity of the
                  lining and its future removability ([[Ryder 1986]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining canvas was sized with one part Lascaux 375 to three
                  parts mineral spirit, applied by brush. This not only provides
                  a uniform appearance at the back after lining but also aids
                  future reversibility by ensuring that more of the adhesive
                  remains stuck to the lining canvas, rather than to the back of
                  the original. Knots in the canvas were more readily removed
                  (with scalpels) after the sizing, and both sides of the canvas
                  were lightly sanded to give a smooth surface before a further
                  six coats of Lascaux 375, diluted 1:1 in mineral spirit, were
                  brushed onto one side of the canvas, with 24 hours drying time
                  allowed between each coat. This produced an even adhesive
                  layer that completely covered the canvas texture. The Lascaux
                  375 adhesive was not applied to the back of the painting, as
                  that would have produced an overly strong bond between the two
                  canvases and would impair the future removal of the lining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining canvas was then removed from the loom and rolled
                  onto a wooden roller, which was then taken to the lining
                  studio.

                  Construction of the Vacuum Envelope
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The vacuum envelope consisted of three lower sheets of thick
                  Melinex taped together with good-quality cellophane tape and
                  covered with overlapping sheets of silicon-coated Melinex,
                  which were taped at the edges to the thick Melinex ([<strong>fig. 8.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-5)).
                  The lining canvas was unrolled on top of the silicon-coated
                  Melinex with the adhesive layer face up, and the painting was
                  then positioned on top of the lining adhesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The same loom used in the preparation of the lining canvas was
                  positioned around the edges. The two long sides of the loom
                  were reinforced with wooden strips to prevent it from bowing
                  when the materials were stretched onto it, and holes were also
                  drilled through the short sides of the loom to accommodate the
                  tubing, which would later be connected to the two vacuum pumps
                  (see [<strong>fig. 8.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-5)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining canvas was first stretched onto the loom using
                  staples. The thick Melinex was also stapled to the loom
                  through a layer of tape to stop the Melinex from tearing, and
                  the staples were then covered with more tape to prevent air
                  leakage from within the envelope. The loom was lightly keyed
                  out at the corners so that the lining canvas and Melinex were
                  reasonably taut.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Strips of siliconed Melinex were taped around the edges of the
                  picture to stop the exposed areas of Lascaux 375 at the edges
                  of the painting from sticking to the top sheet of Melinex when
                  the adhesive was heated (see [<strong>fig. 8.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-5)).
                  This enabled the extraction of air from the central areas of
                  the picture and ensured that the entire painting could be
                  maintained under vacuum pressure throughout the lining

                  The air extraction system consisted of plastic plumbing pipes
                  drilled with holes at regular intervals and placed around the
                  edges of the picture and positioned on top of canvas webbing,
                  which further aided the extraction of air (see [<strong>fig. 8.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-5)).
                  The tubes connecting the pipework to the pumps were inserted
                  through a hole at each end of the loom and sealed in place
                  with silicon sealant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The top sheet of thinner Melinex, three sheets taped together,
                  was placed over the picture and taped to the top of the loom.
                  Previously, the wooden keys in the corners had been covered
                  with foam, and the edges of the loom rounded, in order to
                  avoid any sharp edges inside the envelope that might tear the
                  thin Melinex when under vacuum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Apart from its size and the air extraction system, the
                  construction of the envelope did not differ significantly from
                  the one presented by Gerry Hedley, Stephen Hackney, and Alan
                  Cummings at the Greenwich lining conference in 1974 ([[Hedley,
                  Hackney, and Cummings 2003]]). As they discovered, the
                  rigidity of the underlying thick Melinex is important in
                  preventing areas of impasto and surface distortions in the
                  painting from becoming “centered,” or partially pushed out to
                  the back of the lining when under vacuum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The pumps were not fitted with pressure gauges, and three
                  holes were drilled into the tubing at both ends to introduce
                  air leakage and thereby a reduction in pressure. This number
                  of holes was sufficient to allow the top layer of Melinex to
                  be comfortably pushed away from the paint surface.

                <p>
                  A large Willard Multi-purpose Low Pressure Table with a
                  surface area of 4&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp;m was used as the heat source. The
                  painting, being larger than the table, had to be heated in two
                  stages. Heating one half of the painting while the other
                  remains cool presents a problem, however: as the first section
                  is heated, the envelope and the materials inside it expand,
                  and can cause undulations between the heated and unheated
                  areas. Several means were used to obviate this:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The unheated section was warmed with domestic electric
                      blankets covered with foil to retain the heat. This
                      achieved a temperature of around 32°C on the picture
                      surface.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Four fan heaters were placed under the envelope pointing
                      upward and toward the edge of the lining table. This gave
                      a temperature of 38°C–40°C on the area of the painting
                      above the edge of the table.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      A centimeter-thick strip of Plastazote foam was taped
                      along the edge of the table to raise the envelope away
                      from the tabletop, to create an air gap that would reduce
                      the temperature at this point.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The envelope was moved onto the Willard table with the half
                  overhanging (not on the table) supported with adjustable props
                  ([<strong>fig. 8.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-6)).
                  For half an hour before the table was heated the vacuum pumps
                  were left running at full strength, with all the holes in the
                  tubing covered with tape. This ensured that any air trapped
                  between the lining canvas and painting was extracted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The holes in the tubing were then untaped and the pressure
                  reduced. The table’s heaters, set at 70°C, were switched on,
                  and at around 45°C, the temperature at which the adhesive
                  begins to soften, local areas of the painting were treated
                  with hot spatulas to improve small remaining surface
                  distortions. The temperature at the top surface was
                  independently monitored with thermocouples, and once these had
                  reached 68°C, the envelope was lifted off the table and the
                  second half was then positioned, with a slight overlap between
                  the two sections. The electric blankets were removed and the
                  foil placed over the already heated section.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the measures used to prevent undulations from
                  occurring, these did begin to appear, but they disappeared
                  instantly when the props at the unheated end were raised,
                  increasing the air gap between the envelope and the edge of
                  the table, and thereby reducing the temperature at this point.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once the entire painting had been heated, it was carried,
                  still under vacuum, to a large table, where it cooled within
                  fifteen minutes. The envelope was dismantled, and the
                  following day the painting was restretched onto its existing
                  stretcher using copper tacks, and the keys were secured.
                </p>
                <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  The treatment did much to improve the surface appearance of
                  the painting by removing the lumps and undulations created by
                  the 1952 wax relining and also provided a more durable support
                  for the picture than had been previously achieved. Although
                  improvements were made to the raised creases that were a
                  result of Morrill’s second relining, the flattened and moated
                  areas of impasto remained unchanged. After the relining had
                  been completed, the painting was retouched and revarnished
                  before being returned to display in Room 31 ([<strong>fig. 8.7</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/8-Ackroyd/fig-8-7)).

                  Mist lining was developed by Jos van Och at the Stichting
                  Restauratie Atelier Limburg (SRAL) in Maastricht, The
                  Netherlands, in the 1990s. It has since been used successfully
                  to line numerous paintings, large and small, of different
                  ages, conditions, and painting techniques. Pretreatments are
                  used to solve distinct problems, leaving the action of lining
                  solely to providing additional support. The mist-lining system
                  avoids the use of heat, moisture, and high pressure and thus
                  respects the integrity of the original structure and texture.
                  Mist lining provides an alternative, low-cost system to
                  traditional or other modern lining techniques. Careful
                  selection of lining support, the manner in which the lining
                  adhesive is applied, and the means to set the bond
                  differentiates this technique. The acrylic adhesive creates a
                  “bridge” between the two canvases without impregnation.
                  Choosing the right solvent for activation allows the acrylic
                  adhesive to bond well to a wide variety of previously treated
                  canvases, including wax-resin lined paintings. The bond has
                  good shear resistance, though its peel force is lower.
                  Delining of previously mist-lined canvases is therefore
                  facilitated, allowing mist-lined canvases to be delined
                  successfully, even over time.

                <p>
                  Lining canvas paintings has ever been a contentious action.
                  Many canvas paintings have been lined, and at times relined.
                  Age and condition have often not been prerequisites for
                  implementing linings, as for a time it was seen as a
                  preventative measure. Linings were intended to carry the load
                  that the original damaged support could no longer bear, as
                  well as solving a multitude of other structural issues,
                  including consolidation and improvement of cupping and planar
                  distortions. This often “one-stop” <span></span>process was
                  deemed long lasting, beneficial, and cost efficient. The type
                  of lining carried out tended to be dependent on the training
                  of the conservator-restorer, studio practice, and geographical
                  location. Time has shown that the life span of linings is
                  determinable, and the lining cycle continues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The “moratorium” on lining called for after 1974 Greenwich
                  conference on comparative lining techniques ([[Villers
                  2003b]]) never materialized, but the idea encouraged
                  conservators to think of other options for structural repair.
                  Full linings fell out of fashion, and strip-lining as well as
                  thread-by-thread tear mending became standard practice.
                  However, these options cannot be used for severely
                  structurally compromised canvas paintings—thus, full lining
                  continues to be necessary. The mist-lining process is still a
                  relatively new technique and not yet part of many
                  conservators’ toolkits. Familiarity with this process can
                  expand the contemporary conservator’s repertoire and provide
                  one of a few ethical solutions for structural support.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mist-lining process was invented and developed by Jos van
                  Och in the 1990s at the Stichting Restauratie Atelier Limburg
                  (SRAL) ([[Fife, van Och, and Harrison 2017]]; [[Seymour and
                  van Och 2005]];[[van Och and Hoppenbrouwers 2003]]). The term
                  <em>mist lining</em> was coined by SRAL in the early 2000s and
                  is now used to denote the technique, system, and process. The
                  mist-lining system has roots in developments in structural
                  treatments for lining canvases initially presented in the
                  1970s by Gustav Berger and Vishwa R. Mehra ([[Berger 1972a]];
                  [[Mehra 1975a]]; [[Mehra 1975b]]).

                  Mist lining is a noninvasive lining technique that involves
                  spraying minimal amounts of an acrylic dispersion resin onto
                  an auxiliary canvas before adhering that canvas to the reverse
                  of the original support, often without tension. This open
                  adhesive network is regenerated from the dry state,
                  eliminating moisture. Solvent vapors (or gentle heat) are used
                  to swell and tackify the adhesive.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Bonding occurs under light pressure when the adhesive is
                  activated. The system can be classified as a cold-lining
                  method and forms a nap bond. The lining adhesive remains
                  sandwiched between the two canvases with no impregnation of
                  either textiles or decorative layers, which aids reversibility
                  and negates any alteration of appearance.

                  Mist-Lining Methodology
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The origins of mist lining lie in the desire to find an
                  ethical replacement for more invasive lining techniques.
                  Conservators commit to following a code of ethics. These
                  emphasize that cultural heritage should be preserved for
                  future generations while respecting aesthetic, historic, and
                  intangible significances, as well as maintaining physical
                  integrity. Conservators should, thus, limit treatment to
                  necessary actions and strive to use compatible, non-altering
                  products, materials, and procedures. Treatments should not
                  interfere with future actions, examination, or analysis, and
                  should be reversible.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  The non-impregnating, easily reversible mist-lining system
                  complies with this ethos.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mist-lining process is not a stand-alone procedure and
                  must be considered in relation to other treatments that will
                  be carried out on the painting, either before or after lining.
                  The mist-lining methodology requires each problem to be
                  handled independently. Simply put, the issues presented by the
                  painting are analyzed and solutions to deal with each specific
                  situation are found and resolved independently of lining. The
                  lining action is, thus, kept separate from other required
                  treatments. This enables the process to be highly adaptable
                  and tailored to the individual case.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mist lining is typically carried out after any reduction of
                  planar distortions, overall treatment of the support,
                  consolidation of paint layers, individual mending and/or
                  strengthening of tears and holes, and removal of undesired
                  superficial layers. Deformations are first flattened by
                  prestretching the support and applying gentle and gradual
                  lateral tension, often combined with humidification.
                  Conversely, the mist-lining system will conform to any
                  preexisting out-of-plane deformations and thus can be used to
                  support (modern) canvas paintings devised with a more
                  three-dimensional nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consolidation of paint layers occurs as a separate step using
                  an appropriate adhesive. Removal of varnish layers and
                  overpaints is carried out prior to lining, though linings can
                  be effectuated with any nonoriginal coatings left intact.
                  Subsequent treatments often involve filling of paint losses,
                  retouching, and revarnishing. After lining, it is imperative
                  to consider fully the implications of the choice of solvent
                  for varnish application, or the use of heat to impress texture
                  in fills, as both solvent exposure and heat will affect the
                  lining adhesive. Some examples of pretreatments implemented
                  prior to mist lining are reported in the
                  <em>Mist-Lining Handbook</em> ([[Seymour and Strombek 2022]]).
                  Mist lining has been a successful choice for paintings that
                  have a past structural treatment legacy, whether lined with
                  glue-paste or wax-resin adhesives or both. Research has been
                  carried out showing that the sprayed acrylic adhesive adheres
                  well to canvases impregnated with wax resin ([[Contreras
                  2015]];[[Fischer 2002]]). This property enables the use of
                  heat on these thermo-sensitive structures to be avoided.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mist-lining process allows conservators to make the best
                  choice for the needs of the individual canvas painting, rather
                  than using a standardized technique to solve all issues. The
                  choice to use the mist-lining system, thus, comes at the
                  initial stage of the decision-making process—when considering
                  the treatment plan—although the commitment to using the system
                  can be altered, if necessary, as treatment progresses. The
                  order of treatments, therefore, needs to be fully considered
                  before the plan is confirmed. Our philosophy is to leave
                  options open as much as possible. Each step of the treatment
                  process is thought through, taking into account the
                  consequences for subsequent procedures and future behavior of
                  materials inherent in the system. For this reason, the
                  pretreatments described have great importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The decision to use this system comes with a caveat.
                  Expectations for results need to be tempered to accept
                  surfaces that are not as “flat as a board” or linings that are
                  not as “rigid as a plank.” This system does not produce the
                  same degree of surface finish and stiffness provided by
                  traditional linings. The natural drape of the canvas and
                  texture of paint layers will not be significantly altered
                  during lining. Any out-of-plane texture or impasto (including
                  cupping) that exists before lining will be maintained.
                  Consolidation problems are not resolved. The key, as
                  mentioned, is to treat these defects, as necessary, prior to
                  lining and to accept a certain natural “aged” look. (This may
                  mean taking a different approach to dealing with clients or
                  owners of paintings.) Nor does the system provide a stiff
                  lining support. Mist lining moves away from the idea that the
                  lining should carry all the stress within the laminate
                  structure. Instead, a mist lining provides “gentle” support to
                  the original materials, helping to mitigate dimensional
                  changes induced by climatic variations, but not preventing
                  them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These aspects of the system remain open to debate. No complete
                  scientific study comparing mist-lining results to those of
                  other lining systems has been carried out. This “new” approach
                  thus remains unprovable. However, numerous paintings, large
                  and small in scale and presenting a wide variety of past
                  treatments and conditions, have been lined with this system.
                  These have performed well over the last thirty years, so
                  perhaps the “proof is in the pudding.” Ongoing research aims
                  to provide further insight and answers to these issues
                  ([[Poulis, Seymour, and Yasmine 2020]]).

                  The Mist-Lining Process
                </h2>
                <p>
                  As mentioned, the mist-lining technique uses an acrylic
                  dispersion resin sprayed onto a prepared auxiliary textile
                  support. The result is an open network, rather than a
                  continuous layer of adhesive, which is allowed to dry on
                  application. After the lining canvas is placed in position,
                  the adhesive can be regenerated in-situ with solvent vapors.
                  Bonding occurs under low pressure without the use of heat or
                  moisture. The system effects a nap-bond with no impregnation
                  of the original textile or migration into the decorative
                  layers. This aids reversibility and avoids any change in
                  appearance. Delining can be effected by applying peel forces
                  (sometimes after solvent exposure) with little or no adhesive
                  remaining attached to the original textile.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The technique requires little equipment and is easy to set up
                  in the studio or on site. The low-pressure envelope can easily
                  be adapted to accommodate paintings of different sizes or
                  orientations (horizontal or vertical). Linings have been
                  effectively implemented on all sizes of paintings, including
                  large, oversized formats.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  Low-pressure tables can also be used, if a flatter lining
                  surface is needed. Furthermore, the adhesive mixture and
                  application process can be applied to effect strip-linings if
                  a full lining is not desirable.

                  Canvas Selection and Preparation
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Factors influencing the choice of lining canvas are the
                  ability to develop a nap, flexibility versus rigidity (drape),
                  responsiveness to humidity fluctuations, type of weave, and
                  thickness of the canvas. The response rate of warp and weft
                  threads to external conditions should be similar. Open-weave
                  fabrics are preferred, as less tension is required to decrimp
                  the fabric and to remount the painting. More importantly,
                  solvent vapors can diffuse more readily through open-weave
                  textiles so less solvent volume is required during activation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A wide range of textiles have been used by the SRAL team over
                  the years. Research into the mechanical properties of linen,
                  polyester, and mixed-fiber textiles have been considered
                  ([[Young and Jardine 2012]]). Choices are made on a
                  case-by-case basis. The canvas requires a spun-yarn textile
                  fabric, rather than a monofilament. Typically, open-weave
                  lightweight natural linen fabrics or a fire-resistant
                  lightweight spun-yarn polyester textile (Trevera CS) are used.
                  Many other fabric types have also been experimented with and
                  employed ([[Seymour and Strombek 2022]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining canvas may be tensioned prior to the application of
                  the sprayed adhesive. Natural linen textiles are decrimped,
                  only if the weave is dense, as the necessity is less for
                  open-weave textiles. The desired tension of the lining textile
                  is dependent on numerous factors. Firstly, the conservator
                  should determine if the lining process will take place under
                  tension or with either or both canvases in a free state. This
                  decision may depend on logistics (size), the condition of the
                  painting (first lining or relining), and future display
                  (environmental factors). Tension is thus considered a variable
                  in the process and cannot be quantified with a constant
                  number; however, the tension applied when preparing the lining
                  canvas should not be more than what will be required when
                  remounting the painting. The aim is not to overstretch the
                  adhesive when the lining is complete and to effect in an
                  undisturbed point-to-point bond between the two canvases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The size of the original support (including tacking margins)
                  is masked out on the lining canvas to ensure that the edges of
                  the lining fabric are not coated with adhesive. The surface of
                  the stretched lining canvas is prepared by enhancing the nap.
                  The yarn is disrupted to encourage fibers to protrude from the
                  surface. Nap fibers are fluffed up using sandpaper worked
                  gently in the same directions as the weave. The yarn should
                  not be broken. Care is taken not to disturb the napped surface
                  before spraying on the adhesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Interleaf textiles can be inserted as required to provide
                  enhanced local (to support tears or holes) or overall
                  stiffness. Nonwoven polyester or woven glass-fiber interleafs
                  (adhered prior to lining with either Plextol mixtures or Beva
                  371 Film) are typically used at SRAL. These will mitigate the
                  return of viscoelastic, out-of-plane deformations.

                  Currently, two methacrylic ester-acrylic ester copolymer
                  dispersions are mixed to obtain desired performance stiffness
                  and solubility characteristics. Plextol D&nbsp;540 and Dispersion
                  K&nbsp;360 (adjusted to pH 7) are used in a 30:70 ratio, but other
                  formulations are being further investigated due to the
                  discontinuation of Plextol D&nbsp;540. The manufacturer of Plextol
                  (Synthomer) has recommended as a substitute Plextol D&nbsp;512.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  This and other alternatives (Plextol D&nbsp;498 and Plextol B&nbsp;500)
                  are being tested to compare results at Delft University of
                  Technology (TU Delft) ([[Poulis, Seymour, and Mosleh
                  2020]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>

                <p>
                  A high-volume, low-pressure (HVLP) compressed-air spray gun is
                  used to spray the adhesive onto the canvas in a fine mist. The
                  spray mist only encapsulates the raised nap and does not
                  impregnate the lining fabric or create a continuous coating.
                  As only the nap is coated, the mechanical-physical properties
                  of the canvas are unchanged; it remains flexible and able to
                  conform to the drape and morphology dictated by the original
                  canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The optimum result is achieved when the adhesive is sprayed
                  from different angles in more than one layer. The aim is to
                  use as little adhesive as possible, something that is
                  currently judged through experience. The coating should remain
                  open and “fluffy” so as to allow the solvent vapors easy
                  access. A thinner layer of adhesive will react more quickly to
                  the solvent vapors and will need less pressure to create a
                  bond, but the bond achieved will be more resistant if the
                  adhesive layer is more substantial. It is, however, never the
                  aim to have a thick layer of adhesive! The ultimate thickness
                  of the sprayed adhesive layer is considered one of the key
                  variables of the system. We suggest those new to the system
                  practice these decision-making processes on mock-ups to gain
                  insight into such variables. [<strong>Figs. 9.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/9-Seymour/fig-9-1)

                  The sprayed adhesive is allowed to dry before lining occurs.
                  The two canvases are brought together before a subsequent bond
                  is effected within a low-pressure envelope. The original
                  canvas is carefully positioned on the lining canvas in contact
                  with the sprayed area. Smaller paintings can be lined face up
                  with the lining canvas loomed or untensioned, while larger
                  paintings are typically lined without being tensioned and face
                  down. In the latter case, the lining canvas is often rolled
                  into position over the exposed reverse of the original. It is
                  imperative that placement is carried out carefully and
                  precisely, so as not to flatten the fluffed, open network of
                  the adhesive and to ensure that the weave of the lining canvas
                  aligns with that of the original. Dragging the original over
                  the sprayed adhesive surface will deform the adhesive surface
                  and compress it into a continuous coating.

                  The Low-Pressure Envelope
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The low-pressure envelope consists of two differing
                  thicknesses of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic
                  sheeting and a ring of perforated pipes connected to a
                  centrifugal fan (or vacuum cleaner) ([<strong>fig. 9.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/9-Seymour/fig-9-3)).
                  Both plastic sheets should be solvent (and heat) resistant.
                  The plastic sheeting is typically sourced at local building
                  merchants. The thicker plastic sheet can be stretched to a
                  working frame that is larger than the lining canvas or taped
                  to a flat surface such as a table or floor. The thinner,
                  unstretched plastic sheet should be flexible enough to
                  accommodate surface topography (e.g., impasto, cupping). In
                  some cases, the setup can be reversed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The design of the low-pressure envelope is another key
                  variable of this adaptive system. Varying the thickness and
                  tension of the plastic sheeting will modify the pressure
                  exerted. The flexibility of the plastic sheeting allows an
                  even pressure to be applied over the whole surface area as the
                  plastic conforms to the topography of the structure within the
                  low-pressure envelope. A stiffer sheet of plastic (such as
                  Melinex) would exert pressure on high points and the force
                  exerted would be imposed on a smaller area. Using a too-stiff
                  membrane could potentially cause moating or even flatten
                  impastos; it could also push out-of-plane structures, such as
                  seams, forward. Slight deformations in the canvas can,
                  however, be manipulated, but the system does not exert
                  sufficient pressure to push severe deformations into plane.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Air is extracted from the low-pressure envelope using a ring
                  of perforated pipes (diameter about 2 cm). We typically use
                  PVC pipes intended to house electrical wires in walls, which
                  are sourced from local building merchants. Other improvised
                  versions could be utilized, such as garden hosepipes or
                  washing machine hose. The tubes should not deform when air is
                  extracted. Lengths of up to 3 meters can be bought and
                  modified to the desired size. Connection pieces make it
                  possible to extend beyond this dimension and connect at the
                  corners. The ring should be a good 20–30 centimeters wider
                  than the (loomed) lining canvas. Both plastic sheets used for
                  the envelope should be larger than the ring. Holes are drilled
                  into one side of the pipes at regular intervals. When
                  assembled, all corners and joints are taped together to ensure
                  the ring maintains its shape and does not disconnect during
                  lining. A T connector is used to attach the ring to the
                  centrifugal fan. When placed in the envelope, the pipes are
                  covered with a textile “sock” to ensure that the plastic
                  sheeting is not drawn into the holes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Air is extracted from the center of the envelope by including
                  a piece of cloth slightly larger than the ring system. We call
                  this a “breather.” It is typically placed on top of the
                  stiffer membrane. Note that there should also be soft material
                  placed under the envelope, outside the system, to ensure the
                  envelope is floating and that, if punctured, it will not be
                  sucked down to the flat surface, which would induce excess
                  pressure during lining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the centrifugal fan is turned on, air is extracted from
                  between the two plastic membranes evenly. Sharp edges (e.g.,
                  working loom members) should be padded with cloth coverings.
                  These also aid in the extraction of air from the center of the
                  envelope to the ring system. Thin nonwoven fabrics can also be
                  placed over the paint surface if desired; however, these stop
                  the upper plastic membrane from following the morphology of
                  the surface and may diminish the bond achieved. The exact
                  conformation to the surfaces (upper paint and lower textile)
                  by the plastic sheets permits a point-to-point bonding at a
                  low, even pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the low-pressure envelope is used in the lining
                  process it can also be used for a variety of other
                  conservation treatments. Further information on the materials
                  used is provided in the
                  <em>Mist-Lining Handbook</em> ([[Seymour and Strombek 2022]]).
                  We advise some experimentation prior to determining the setup
                  for the low-pressure envelope.
                </p>
                <h3 id="bond-formation" tabindex="-1">Bond Formation</h3>
                <p>
                  As opposed to a continuous coating, when dried, the open
                  adhesive network can effect a light bond with a very small
                  amount of adhesive. A dried thick, continuous (stiff) coating
                  of an adhesive will need to deform or soften in order to
                  uniformly connect the two undulating surfaces. In this case,
                  heat and high pressure can expedite and ensure a good bond,
                  but often at the expense of paint modification and
                  impregnation of nonoriginal materials into the original
                  textile and decorative layers. In the mist-lining system, the
                  “fluffy” adhesive layer has a volume that accommodates the
                  distance between the two woven textiles. During lining, gentle
                  pressure is sufficient to ensure that the two canvases remain
                  connected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The adhesive is reactivated in-situ using solvent vapors.
                  Solvent exposure induces swelling, allowing the adhesive to
                  regenerate and become tacky. The volume of solvent vapors
                  required to regenerate the adhesive is carefully calculated to
                  ensure that the adhesive swells and becomes sticky, but does
                  not dissolve, ensuring that the adhesive remains between the
                  lining and the original canvas. Solvent selection is dependent
                  upon a number of factors, including the sensitivity of paint
                  and varnish layers, the condition of the reverse of the
                  original support, any remnants of previous lining adhesives,
                  and, of course, the solubility parameters of the adhesive.
                  Acrylic dispersions are sensitive to a range of solvents,
                  including alcohols and aromatic hydrocarbons.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  Mixtures of these can also be considered. The choice of
                  solvent(s), duration of exposure to solvent vapors, and the
                  pressure exerted within the low-pressure envelope will affect
                  the bond strength achieved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Testing ensures that the best solvent is selected. We
                  recommend using smaller sections of a representative lining
                  canvas sprayed with a similar amount of adhesive to test for
                  an effective representative bond. Sections are placed on the
                  reverse of the original and exposed to different preselected
                  solvent vapors for the same amount of time. The sections are
                  left under weight until the solvent has evaporated, and then
                  each is peeled away evaluating the effectiveness of the bond.
                  Experience builds an expectation of results, but tests do
                  ensure a better understanding of the individual variables that
                  can be implemented for particular cases.

                  Effecting a Mist Lining
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The lining is carried out within the low-pressure envelope
                  ([<strong>fig. 9.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/9-Seymour/fig-9-4)).
                  First, the solvent vapors are introduced into the envelope
                  using a “solvent-delivery cloth”—typically, an open-weave
                  cotton cheesecloth. The ability of the solvent-delivery cloth
                  to absorb the solvents used will dictate the volume of solvent
                  that is needed; the volume used at SRAL is 60 ml of solvent
                  per square meter of cheesecloth. The cheesecloth should be
                  slightly larger than the area of sprayed adhesive, as it will
                  shrink slightly as the fluid solvent is absorbed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The solvent-delivery cloth is rolled up and encapsulated in
                  plastic (clingfilm or Saran wrap) before the solvent is
                  introduced. The solvent is injected into the package using a
                  needle and syringe. Sufficient time must be allowed before
                  placing the solvent-delivery cloth in the envelope for the
                  solvent to spread evenly throughout the cloth. When the
                  solvent has evenly dampened the solvent-delivery cloth and the
                  lining set up is established, it is rolled out inside the
                  envelope, placed at the reverse of the lining canvas, as can
                  be seen in [<strong>fig. 9.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/9-Seymour/fig-9-5).
                  Placing the cloth in the envelope and rolling it out inside
                  the envelope should be practiced until it can be done quickly
                  enough that solvent is not lost through evaporation (during
                  the application process).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The solvent vapors, thus delivered, defuse through the lining
                  fabric to the open adhesive network. Once the adhesive is
                  tacky (but not dissolved), the solvent-delivery cloth is
                  removed; typically, this takes between ten and twenty minutes.
                  Air is extracted from the envelope to expedite the activation
                  time, but continual pressure is not necessary at this stage.
                  The solvent-delivery cloth should be replaced with a dry cloth
                  to facilitate solvent evaporation during bond formation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once the solvent-delivery cloth has been removed, the air is
                  extracted from the low-pressure envelope. This causes the two
                  canvases to be drawn together and the reactivated, (thin)
                  adhesive spray coating can bridge distance between the two.
                  Pressure is maintained until the majority of solvent vapors
                  have evaporated and the adhesive is reset. The amount of
                  pressure in the envelope is determined by the degree of air
                  extracted by the centrifugal fan and the thickness/stiffness
                  of the plastic sheeting. Typically, values of 90 mbar are
                  reached and maintained for about sixty to ninety minutes. For
                  safety reasons, as solvent vapors are being passed through an
                  electrical motor, an attendant should be present at all times
                  during the lining. The risk of sparks igniting dust particles
                  within the motor should be prevented by using the motor
                  exclusively for air extraction. Air exchange values can be
                  used to reduce risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We recommend that conservators experiment and become
                  comfortable with the system variables before undertaking a
                  mist lining. Results are impressive ([<strong>figs. 9.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/9-Seymour/fig-9-6)
                  and

                  Aspects to consider are pretreatments, thickness of the
                  adhesive layer, the type of solvents and lining canvas
                  selected, and the setup of the envelope.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  The SRAL team has imparted our knowledge and experiences of
                  the Mist-Lining system to the wider conservation field over
                  the years (see Appendix for a chronology of workshops and
                  conferences disseminating the mist-lining system). Students
                  studying conservation in The Netherlands have been instructed
                  in the system since the early 1990s. International interns,
                  fellows, and junior conservators working at SRAL over the past
                  thirty years have all used the system. Papers have been
                  written describing it, and presentations have been given at
                  conferences (see [Barbosa et
                  al.](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/9-Seymour/paper-54)

                  Dissemination has had successes and failures and has led to
                  further modifications in the system. The expertise of the
                  system still remains largely in-house at SRAL, however, and
                  the use of this relatively new system is not widespread.
                  Because the system is adaptive and tailored to the needs of
                  the painting, it is full of variables that may be difficult to
                  grasp if not encountered in practice. Thus, confidence in
                  considering this non-invasive and gentle approach to the
                  structural repair of canvases may be lacking in many
                  conservators less familiar with the system.

                  In 2019, with the generous support of the Getty Foundation’s
                  Conserving Canvas Initiative, SRAL organized the Mist-Lining
                  Workshop to further disseminate this technique and share our
                  experiences. The aim was to provide midcareer conservators
                  from different world regions with hands-on experience of this
                  alternative option for the structural repair of canvas
                  paintings. At the same time, this global group also brought
                  new thoughts and inspired further adaptations and developments
                  of the mist-lining system ([[Nadeau et al. 2020]]). The
                  workshop was documented in film and print. The video, produced

                  It is full of information on case studies, material
                  information, and sources. Once practiced, the mist-lining
                  system’s variables become something that the conservator can
                  use to tailor treatment to the particular needs of each case.
                  The materials and equipment needed are low cost and relatively
                  easy to source locally. We hope that these new resources will
                  give this viable system new traction as a treatment option.

                <p>
                  The mist-lining system remains frequently used at SRAL. A
                  numerical quantification of paintings treated with this system
                  has not been carried out. However, it is safe to say that over
                  the past thirty years, some hundreds of paintings, belonging
                  to local, national, and international collections have been
                  treated by the SRAL team using this process. To date, none of
                  any of those so treated have been returned due to failure of
                  the lining. This body of work provides empirical confirmation
                  of the success of the system. Of course, failures—or rather,
                  disappointments—have occurred. These setbacks are typically
                  evident immediately after lining, before the artwork is
                  returned to its collection, and thus can be resolved
                  immediately. Reflecting on these complications provides
                  learning lessons for the SRAL team and encourages further
                  developments or adaptations of the system.

                  Conservation ethics have shifted over the past decades towards
                  a minimal approach and avoidance of invasive treatments. The
                  change in ethos to the structural repair of canvases allows
                  the conservator to identify and find solutions to separate
                  problems presented by the painting. Lining has become, with
                  the mist-lining system, a custom action. There are, of course,
                  drawbacks to lining with this system, such as covering the
                  original canvas from view and using solvent vapors to
                  regenerate the lining adhesive, because those vapors permeate
                  throughout the painting structure. However, the choice of
                  adhesive and its relatively long-term chemical stability mean
                  that the adhesive bond can be reversed in the future. The
                  original reverse of the canvas can thus be regained, if
                  necessary, as the adhesive remains primarily on the lining
                  canvas when delining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The idea that the original canvas will never be the same again
                  after a lining is carried out can now be left behind. The
                  mist-lining system is noninvasive and can provide additional
                  support for canvases without changing the stiffness of the
                  original canvas and without influencing the appearance or
                  saturation of the paint layers. While this process may not be
                  the only modern solution to resolve this new way of thinking,
                  it is an effective and versatile technique that has been used
                  successfully for the last thirty years at SRAL and elsewhere
                  to line a vast number of damaged paintings—and to reline
                  paintings previously lined with glue-paste or wax-resin
                  adhesives.

                        Acrylic adhesives are thermoplastic. Thus, gentle heat
                        (about 50°C) is also sufficient to tackify the dry

                        Until recently, tests at SRAL have been empirical in
                        nature, conducted on mock-ups or historical material
                        (such as old, removed lining canvases or deaccessioned
                        paintings). The lining process and specifications have
                        been adjusted and tested for specific cases. Samples
                        were analyzed between 2014 and 2017 by Dr. J. A. (Hans)
                        Poulis (Director of The Adhesion Institute, TU Delft)
                        and a team of interns at TU Delft, Aerospace Division as
                        well as students from the University of Amsterdam as
                        part of Master Thesis research. Research is continuing
                        and will be published in due course.

                  The author, a liner with long experience in structural
                  conservation of paintings, describes the huge changes he has
                  seen over the past forty years, specifically in the Italian
                  context. Along a path that has passed from tradition to
                  alternative synthetic materials and minimalism, the author
                  learned to adopt an attitude of respecting each painting and
                  adapting treatment to its individual needs while maintaining
                  safety. The essay focuses on a reconsideration and revaluation
                  of traditional methods—whether they can be still used and if
                  their characteristics can be better described from a chemical
                  and mechanical perspective.

                <p>
                  Forty years has passed since I first stepped into a
                  conservation studio. I have spent all those years in Italy,
                  but I have also had the opportunity to travel and build strong
                  friendships with colleagues over the world. Working with them,
                  I realized that each of us comes from a specific background
                  that has particular economic issues, culture, and conservation
                  management, all of which has influenced our training,
                  knowledge, approaches, methodologies, and working practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Italy is a small and challenging country with a huge heritage
                  to preserve and a very long conservation history that has
                  influenced generations of conservators in Europe. Because of
                  this richness, in 1939, Italy established precise rules and
                  roles to defend and protect its heritage based on central
                  control by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage ([[Coccolo
                  2017]]). The ministry fixes the scale of priorities, the way
                  projects have to be designed, and how cost estimates must be
                  calculated (often by the square meter). It is a low-value
                  economy, with private companies covering ninety percent of
                  active conservation, competing to reduce prices and trying to
                  work within tight schedules. It’s not necessary to describe in
                  detail how this public administration manages conservation
                  needs, but certainly one of the first concerns is how to be
                  sustainable without sacrificing quality of treatments. Our
                  community in Italy has suffered under this condition, and only
                  occasionally has it been possible to share our methods,
                  approach, problems, and concerns with an international
                  community. For this reason, I am deeply grateful to the Getty
                  Foundation for the great opportunity offered by the Conserving
                  Canvas initiative.

                <p>
                  At the Yale conference in 2019 we all focused on linings,
                  showing different approaches and methods, but only a few
                  presentations mentioned the need for some sort of
                  consolidation of the paint layers. In my practice I deal with
                  many different cases that show severe deterioration. What I
                  see, most of the time, apart from structural damage (tears,
                  accidents, deformation, etc.) is the loss of strength of all
                  original materials, due mostly to inappropriate environmental
                  conditions. I can’t mention all the different forms that the
                  degradation takes, but what worries me most is the increase in
                  porosity of many painting structures, the weakness of the
                  supports, the risk of losses, and in general the fragility of
                  these incredible artifacts ([<strong>fig. 10.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/fig-10-1)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consolidation is an irreversible process, and for this reason
                  it is viewed as an embarrassment, something that’s better not
                  to talk about. The Center for the Study of Restoration
                  Materials (CESMAR7), an Italian association devoted to
                  research on polychrome surfaces, organized two international
                  meetings on this specific issue in 2006 and 2008 ([[CESMAR7
                  2008]]; [[CESMAR7 2010]]). We realized at that time only a few
                  publications covered the subject and little research was being
                  done; it looked to us that everybody was trying to avoid this
                  field full of uncertainties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course, early lining methods were designed to provide some
                  sort of strength to the grounds and paint film by infusing
                  waxes, resins, and animal glues with the aid of huge pressures
                  and high temperatures. But to definitively step out of this
                  old story we have to design specific consolidation strategies
                  that are informed by a full understanding of the mechanical
                  stresses and damages and of the degree and speed of
                  deterioration of each component.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  To do honest work we should openly discuss many of our totems
                  and try to establish a path toward an adequate decision-making
                  process ([[Ciatti and Signorini 2007]]; [[Michalski and
                  Rossi-Doria 2011]]; [[Rossi-Doria 2010]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consolidation involves a vast amount of knowledge and
                  difficult ethical issues. Each of us has developed a personal
                  framework to understand what the needs are in terms of
                  consolidation, considering future deterioration and designing
                  specific strategies that can guarantee efficacy and respect
                  for the features of original materials—a difficult but
                  necessary task—and we first must understand the best way to
                  achieve a reliable result: from the front, or from the back?
                  It’s a never-ending story, and each of us has his or her own
                  ideas.

                <p>
                  I’m a witness to the changes in Italy on this issue. In the
                  past, we infused animal glues from the reverse, controlling
                  shrinkage dynamics, but then many liners started to consider
                  the increase in sensitivity to moisture and mechanical
                  stresses. After the disasters of the Florentine flood in 1966,
                  our community made a drastic change: the adoption of a total
                  infusion from the reverse of synthetic consolidants, such as
                  Paraloid B‑72, Plexisol, Beva, and others. These were able to
                  strengthen the canvas fibers, treat the excessive porosity,
                  and consolidate degraded paint layers. My generation dedicated
                  a lot of effort to establishing how to manage this difficult
                  task—testing and selecting materials, looking for appropriate
                  concentrations and applications, and finding solvents of lower
                  toxicity. This helped to separate the structural treatment
                  into different steps, where consolidation was one part and
                  lining another. The impact of minimalism pushed us to always
                  look for a compromise between respect for original materials
                  and the need for remedial conservation, dependent on the next
                  steps of treatment as well as the quality of the future
                  environment (rarely stable, rarely monitored).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Synthetic consolidants, in general, produced lower mechanical
                  stresses and had lower reactivity to moisture than traditional
                  consolidants; this in turn stimulated the search for
                  glue-paste linings with reduced shrinkage risk.

                  In my presentation at the conference I showed how lining
                  history developed in Italy through the centuries by focusing
                  on a specific family that worked for 295 years on Roman
                  heritage. Other contributions in this publication describe in
                  more detail the cultural and methodological environment in
                  which Italian liners designed different methods and
                  approaches, mostly in Rome, Florence, Venice, Turin, Naples,
                  Bergamo, and Bologna. It is an extraordinary history of
                  skills, human capacities, and courage, one which produced some
                  mistakes but also wonderful results, considering the
                  difficulties liners had in those times.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During my career I have had to remove some of these old
                  linings and many times I could assess how respectful they
                  were, still showing adequate adhesion after three hundred
                  years but also easy to remove ([<strong>fig. 10.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/fig-10-2)).
                  The most interesting observation is the stability they often
                  show when mounted on strainers with no means of expansion.
                  These skilled artisans changed and modified their methods over
                  time, and this history still belongs to our cultural
                  environment, despite huge changes in the last fifty years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My practice was influenced by the “Roman method” designed by
                  the Istituto Centrale per il Restauro (ICR). This method was
                  brought to the ICR by assistants to Mauro Pelliccioli, a
                  famous Italian restorer from Bergamo who was called to provide
                  linings for war-damaged paintings. In 1963, facing the
                  restoration of the three big paintings by Caravaggio, Giovanni
                  Urbani, the head of paintings labs, refined the method by
                  introducing the use of temporary expandable metal lining
                  stretchers, instead of the heavy wooden looms that were unable
                  to control tension during the lining process. The original
                  Bergamo recipe went through some modifications, as did the
                  ironing process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the next forty years Italians continued to line paintings
                  using traditional methods, with some modifications. The big
                  campaigns of restoration after the war, after the Florence
                  flood, in Venice, and in Rome from 1980 to 2000, confirmed the
                  big differences between regional traditions. One example of
                  this dynamic is the existence of two official Italian
                  methods—the Florentine and the Roman—designed respectively by
                  the Opificio delle Pietre Dure and ICR, both part of the same
                  institution, the Ministry of Cultural Heritage ([[Phenix
                  1995]]; [[Stoner and Rushfield 2012]]).

                <p>
                  Working with glue-paste adhesives has been a necessity in my
                  work. It’s not that I thought that these methods could be
                  applied to all kinds of paintings—many would show problems, so
                  it was necessary to be confident in the use of other methods
                  and materials. It has always been obvious to me that no one
                  treatment can be the magical one that solves all problems
                  without causing any changes. For this reason, I always tried
                  to widen my list of options and to adapt myself to many
                  working conditions, from minimalism and the decision to avoid
                  lining altogether up to (respectful) ways to use synthetic
                  adhesives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As mentioned earlier, sustainability is a crucial issue. The
                  traditional glue-paste methods are low cost, easily used
                  on-site, and don’t require special equipment. Apart from being
                  the only method that is completely nontoxic, it can be
                  extremely effective, respectful, totally reversible, and able
                  to provide stability and the desired stiffness. This is
                  possible because it is adaptable and open to many
                  modifications, as we will see later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For these reasons, in 1995 I started to reconsider all aspects
                  of traditional methods. It has been a long process and remains
                  a work in progress. In the last ten years, I intensified my
                  studies, assessed test results, worked with international
                  researchers, and monitored long-term results.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A big concern is mold growth and attack by
                  <em>Stegobium paniceum</em> (the only insect we find on
                  linings). All natural materials are hygroscopic and have that
                  element of risk, but our observations in Italy indicate that
                  problems occur only in specific microclimates with long
                  exposure to high RH and poor ventilation. Recent tests
                  ([[Fuster-López et al. 2017]]; see also [Fuster-López et al.
                  in this

                  demonstrate that the use of close-weave fabrics and some
                  traditional ingredients—such as rye flour and molasses—can
                  increase the risk. A good backing board, some space between
                  the painting and the wall, and some basic control of damp will
                  reduce this risk in a very effective way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What worries me most about traditional linings is the amount
                  of adhesive applied to the reverse of the painting. Excessive
                  amounts (we might say abusive amounts) of adhesive, of very
                  strong glues, increase the sensitivity to humidity variations,
                  resulting in mechanical stresses being transmitted to the
                  paint layers.

                  The results of the ICOM-CC International Working Group,

                  represent the first attempt at a scientific assessment of
                  glue-paste linings. Some conservators have published results
                  before this of experiments with modified recipes ([[Ackroyd
                  1995]]), but a full understanding was missing. Now, for the
                  first time, it has become possible to study the influence of
                  different materials and different application methods from a
                  mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological point of view,
                  and to establish precise parameters for further investigation.

                  Geographically, the list of materials used in traditional
                  linings is more or less similar, with local variations in the
                  natural fabrics and adhesive mixtures. This section is based

                  Over the centuries, liners have never stopped discussing the
                  selection of the best lining canvas to use, and the search
                  continues to this day—although we now use a more quantitative
                  approach ([[Young 1999]]). The selection of the fabric affects
                  the method, the adhesive application, and many other factors.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  Liners have used close-weave canvases across many local
                  traditions: Florence, France, the UK, the Netherlands,
                  Belgium, Denmark. The shared concept is uniform glue
                  application between the two canvases: the original and the
                  lining. The canvas behaves as a semirigid support stiffened by
                  animal glue, and adhesion is optimized by ironing, which dries
                  the adhesive while applying pressure on the painting surface
                  to flatten deformation or cupping. The glue layer, applied in
                  an even adhesive film (in some traditions quite thickly),
                  carries most of the load of the painting because close-weave
                  fabrics provide poor grip, have high elastic modulus, but
                  develop more mechanical stresses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Observations from monitoring insect infestations shows an
                  increase of deterioration in close-weave linings due to the
                  fact that insects living in the glue layer are protected from
                  ventilation, light, and predators.

                  <em>Open-weave canvases</em>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Open-weave fabrics are part of the Italian and Spanish
                  traditions. In Italy, all methods apart from the Florentine
                  apply open-weave canvases. Often, on big, heavy, damaged
                  paintings, two similar fabrics were stretched on the same loom
                  to obtain a stiffer support.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In my experience, open-weave fabrics don’t need to be washed
                  (unless thread count exceeds 12 to 14 threads per square
                  centimeter), so one can keep the stable materials introduced
                  during production that are used to protect the fibers, such as
                  starches, methylcellulose, and butyl acrylates. They provide a
                  better grip than close-weave fabrics, and the glue film is not
                  continuous, similar to a nap bond. These fabrics are lighter,
                  they transmit less mechanical stress, and are less reactive to
                  RH variation. Mold can develop more easily than on close-weave
                  fabrics, but insects, on the other hand, have a more difficult
                  life.

                  These results confirmed my attitude to using them as lining
                  canvases. Open-weave fabrics can have various fiber densities
                  (from 8 x 8 to 14 x 12), as well as various thread dimensions
                  and torsions, thereby providing a range of performance in
                  terms of support, stiffness, and capacity to stabilize
                  deformations.

                  The revalidation of traditional materials and methods led me
                  to study and then compare recipes used in glue-paste linings.
                  First, I asked myself if the term <em>glue paste</em> properly
                  describes these mixtures. I looked for a more precise name,
                  settling on <em>water-based adhesive gels.</em> The name
                  identifies the principal features of the two main
                  ingredients—flour and animal gelatin—and their unique capacity
                  to trap water for a long time. As they were only adhesive
                  materials available for centuries, it is interesting to assess
                  how restorers varied the way they used them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then I started to study what these ingredients are from a
                  chemical, physical-mechanical, and biological point of view. I
                  had to admit that many of the notions I had received during
                  training were totally insufficient or, in many cases, simply
                  wrong. It took time to realize that conservation science
                  rarely looked at other fields that research these natural
                  materials, such as the food industry, cosmetics, and
                  pharmaceuticals. Multinational companies invest heavily in
                  ongoing studies to optimize their products and their ability
                  to manipulate these natural materials.

                  Apart from the Russian tradition, where only sturgeon glue and
                  some honey was used, all other methods built their recipes
                  using three main groups of ingredients: fillers (wheat and rye
                  flours), materials with adhesive properties (animal gelatins),
                  and additives that modify some of the mechanical properties
                  (honey, molasses, Venetian turpentine, linseed mucilage,
                  vinegar, oxgall, glycerin, oils). I will not focus on this
                  last class of materials because, in reality, they have a
                  marginal role in mechanical behavior in glue-paste linings.
                  Instead, I think it is useful to focus on the two main
                  ingredients: animal gels and flours.

                  These amazing materials are used in many steps of treatment—as
                  an adhesive for facings, a consolidant for paint film
                  decohesion, an ingredient in glue-paste compositions, and as a
                  binder for fillings. In tests over the years, animal glues
                  were chosen for their high strength compared to all synthetic
                  materials. I think it is useful, therefore, to establish some
                  essential information that will guide how and why they can be
                  used ([[Pearson 2003]]; [[Schellmann 2007]]; [[Bigi,
                  Panzavolta, and Rubini 2004]]).

                  Animal gels are produced in two different ways: Type 1 with
                  acid, and Type 2 with alkaline treatments. Mostly conservators
                  work with Type 1 for their higher adhesive properties and gel
                  strength. Manufacturers and mostly wholesale sellers and
                  traders established in Asia (China, Vietnam, Cambodia, India),
                  and to a lesser extend in North America, produce a huge
                  variety of blends for food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.

                  Gel strength (GS) is measured in terms of the Bloom
                  number.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  Manufacturers produce gelatins with different Bloom values for
                  different intended uses by varying the fundamental steps in
                  biochemical treatments and number of extractions. Of course,
                  the quality of collagen and basic materials plays a big role,
                  as do other additives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Depending on Bloom value, gelatins vary their behavior with
                  moisture and their rate of sorption and desorption. Mechanical
                  tests in the conservation literature show curves measured at
                  different RH values but, until now, none of them has specified
                  the gel strength, only the general type of gelatin: rabbit,
                  sturgeon, hide, or bone. Because it’s difficult to find
                  precise technical data on gelatin suppliers’ labeling, it’s
                  probably necessary to develop our manual and sensory skills to
                  (at least) establish a method to estimate gel strength.
                  Specific features can be interpreted and evaluated to
                  correlate with the Bloom scale: speed and quantity of water
                  absorption/release, speed of gel degradation, color, smell,
                  viscosity, time of tack, and gel stiffness. Sturgeon bladder
                  glue Bloom values have only recently been investigated. (All
                  the samples I tried had different Bloom values, as did other
                  gelatins, and any considerations related to flexibility or the
                  higher stability of bladder collagen are not correct if not
                  related to measured Bloom and RH values [[<strong>fig. 10.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/fig-10-3)]
                  ([[Bridarolli et al. 2022]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The range of Bloom values for an animal glue suitable for
                  paintings conservation starts at approximately 150 to 400.
                  Bloom 250 is an average that can be used for most of the
                  purposes mentioned, but it is also possible to define more
                  precise values for each use. Lower Bloom solutions have lower
                  viscosity and longer setting/gelling times (but less
                  strength), so these are useful when better penetration is
                  needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Higher Bloom values provide the opposite: higher viscosity at
                  a given concentration, higher adhesive capacities and tack,
                  faster setting times, less response to short-term RH
                  fluctuations, and more resistance to biological deterioration.
                  They also require higher water temperature for dissolution.
                  Bloom 250 can be used for effective facings and for fillings.
                  Higher values, up to 350, can be used in glue-paste mixtures.
                  Working concentrations vary depending on the gel strength.
                  Working temperatures of 50°C–65°C play a crucial role in
                  reducing viscosity so as to facilitate penetration, whereas
                  room temperatures facilitate the gelling process and reduce
                  penetration.

                  Animal glues lose their properties if exposed to high

                <h4 id="flours" tabindex="-1"><em>Flours</em></h4>
                <p>
                  Liners have used flours from various grains since the
                  beginning. The reason is simple: they were easy to find and
                  prepare, they were (and remain) very cheap, and they provide
                  good adhesion, tack, and a nice stiffness. Their unbelievable
                  mechanical properties ([[Delcour and Hoseney 2010]]) have been
                  exploited by humans in thousands of different ways, depending
                  on materials’ availability and local culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Flour plus water plus heat produces a gel with amazing
                  capacities to trap water and keep it suspended for a long
                  time. Properties can be varied depending on the type of grain
                  and the complex biochemical reactions of their preparation. In
                  conservation, only wheat and rye flours were used since they
                  had better mechanical properties than other grains.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each flour has a different ratio of the two main components:
                  starches and proteins. Wheat flour contains 70%–75% starch,
                  8%–14% proteins, and other substances in small amounts
                  (lipids, polysaccharides, fibers). Cereal and food science
                  produces thousands of research articles about the manipulation
                  of flour properties by the variety of grain and variation in
                  the enzymes of starch and protein.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The capacity to easily manipulate any single component gives
                  the possibility of designing specific blends depending on
                  needs. In 2018, while looking at these possibilities, I
                  thought it would be valuable to follow some of this research
                  to understand if, going outside the limits of edibility, it
                  was possible to design a blend that could be used as an
                  adhesive generally—specifically as a lining adhesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Starches contain two different polysaccharides—amylopectin and
                  amylase—in an 80:20 ratio, both insoluble in water without
                  heat (&gt;65°C). By slightly changing this ratio we can change
                  the stiffness: greater flexibility by increasing amylopectine
                  or greater stiffness by increasing amylose. This ratio is
                  reflected in the protein content of a specific flour.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Proteins in wheat starch are mostly composed of glutenin and
                  gliadin, which form, when hydrated, gluten. By changing the
                  ratio of these two proteins or modifying the total amount, the
                  food industry produces different blends that differ in their
                  “strength.” Strength is measured by the W index, which tells
                  us how resistant a dough is in the rising process and how long
                  it retains water and fermentation gas (carbon dioxide). For
                  conservation purposes, a low W (120–170) provides a stiffer
                  film when dry; conversely, increasing the protein content and
                  W to 350–400 makes the film softer and more flexible. Results
                  coming from the ICOM-CC glue-paste project (see [Fuster- López
                  et al.
                  2022](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/paper-52))
                  suggest that a higher gluten content reduces water absorption,
                  provides lower wetting capacities, and reduces reactivity to
                  RH variations.

                  70:30. The first is W 180–250 and the second W 350. The flour
                  blend is dissolved in water in a ratio of 1:3, then heated at
                  65°C–70°C until a gel develops.

                <p>
                  Animal glue gel (Bloom 250–350) that has been previously
                  prepared in water in a ratio of 1:3 at 55°C is then dissolved
                  into the warm flour mixture. A small amount of alum salts is
                  also added at this stage as a biocide and thickener. The
                  amount of animal glue in the recipe can vary but it is always
                  much less than in most traditional methods. This drastic
                  reduction in glue is necessary to decrease reactivity and
                  mechanical stresses. All additional substances are, in my
                  opinion, useless, and should be avoided.

                  dispersion: 2% to 10%, depending on needs. This product, low
                  cost and easy to find, can improve the adhesive bonding that
                  was lost due to the reduction of animal glue, as well as
                  increase flexibility. At the same time, it drastically
                  decreases water capacity, thereby speeding the drying process,
                  while providing good initial tack. Further research will
                  probably confirm the amount of risk reduction in terms of
                  reactivity and biodeterioration reduction. This adhesive
                  mixture will always be easily reversible, being soluble in
                  water. Any residue can be gently rubbed off.

                  reduced lining canvas reactivity by infusing hydrophobic
                  substances such as wax and synthetic polymers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many conservators treat support and surface deformations using
                  a combination of tension, pressure, humidity, and such
                  procedures as low-pressure, vacuum, and others. I do that too,
                  and results can be extremely successful, but without any
                  stabilization, the “memory” of deformations will cause them to
                  reappear, sooner or later. It’s an old story, but we still
                  need to discuss it.

                  The Lining Process
                </h2>
                <h3 id="facing" tabindex="-1">Facing</h3>
                <p>
                  This crucial step of structural treatment is not always
                  necessary, but it is if one has fragile paint that is at high
                  risk of paint loss during subsequent steps of treatment,
                  especially when removing previous lining materials. In that
                  case, any glue or adhesive applied on the front will try to
                  flow through the porosity and fill the gaps caused by
                  cleavage, delamination, and losses. The selection of a
                  respectful facing adhesive depends on the nature of the paint
                  layers, and wrong decisions can cause damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a facing material I selected a pure-cellulose tissue with
                  13 grams wet strength that has been calendared to be water
                  resistant. The adhesive is applied through the tissue, as with
                  Japanese paper facings. It sets quickly and adapts well to a
                  variety of surface morphologies. Wrinkles are easy to remove.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The glue can be applied in different ways depending on the
                  needs of the treatment plan—by brush or sprayed gently on the
                  surface. It is easy to manipulate the concentration, Bloom
                  values (200–250), and viscosities to achieve the desired
                  result in terms of adhesion, preconsolidation, or treatment of
                  deformations, by exploiting a mix of traditional Japanese
                  paper conservation techniques with similar Italian traditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When dry, the wet strength tissue provides good protection
                  from mechanical stresses applied from the back to remove old
                  canvases and glues. It also provides a barrier to infused
                  consolidants, avoiding solvent migration to the front, and
                  also really helps in stabilizing surface deformations such as
                  bad crack patterns. In addition, these facing are easy to
                  remove and do not leave fibers on the paint surface.
                </p>
                <h3 id="lining" tabindex="-1">Lining</h3>
                <p>
                  The lining process is extremely simplified. The selected open
                  weave canvas is stretched on a provisional expandable lining
                  stretcher that can accommodate a wide range of dimensions and
                  consistently control canvas tension ([<strong>fig. 10.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/fig-10-5)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The adhesive mixture is then applied on the reverse of the
                  painting in an even coat, and the working stretcher is
                  correctly positioned on top of it. More adhesive is applied to
                  wet the new canvas and provide a first bonding ([<strong>figs. 10.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/fig-10-6)
                  and
                  [<strong>10.7</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/10-Rossi%20Doria/fig-10-7)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The glue application behaves as a very slow humidifier that
                  relaxes deformation and distortions. It is possible to set the
                  time for an even humidification process, depending on the
                  degree of deformation. In cases where deformations have been
                  pretreated and the painting is flat, one can immediately apply
                  gentle tension to the lining canvas and remove excess adhesive
                  by manually pressing with wooden spatulas and other tools for
                  an even application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Drying time can vary depending on the need for additional
                  humidification to soften hard cracks and surface deformation.
                  In cases where we don’t have such needs, the painting can dry
                  without any additional operation, and ironing can be avoided.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Manual ironing is an option to treat surface deformation once
                  it has been humidified by the glue during the lining process.
                  It is possible to achieve great results without using huge
                  pressure or high temperatures. Bad crack patterns can be
                  flattened by locally applying additional moisture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of the drying process, the facing can be removed
                  easily.
                </p>
                <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  Looking ahead, it is possible that these methods will
                  disappear from the accepted list of lining options and be
                  mentioned only in lectures on the history of conservation—or
                  will remain in use only by traditional liners in the private
                  sector. However, I think that omitting this information risks
                  the next generation of conservators losing a full
                  understanding of how to properly preserve many thousands of
                  glue-paste-lined paintings all over the world. I hope this
                  paper can contribute to a better understanding of the
                  potentialities, features, and behavior of water-based
                  adhesives, as well as stimulate the curiosity to finally
                  assess them in a rational, open-minded way ([[Rossi-Doria
                  2013]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As mentioned, I do work with other materials—Beva and
                  acrylics—as other options. These alternative methods have
                  their advantages and disadvantages, the latter mostly due to
                  the use of high temperatures or solvents for reactivation;
                  these linings have low elastic modulus and are quite difficult
                  to remove without additional heat or solvents. The recent
                  habit to use Beva film extensively worries me, just as Vishwa
                  Mehra in 1970 was scared by wax and its abuse. I hope we can
                  soon reconsider this habit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even when using these modern procedures, I try to apply the
                  same approach I use for traditional materials—looking for more
                  respectful applications and avoiding flow of the adhesive
                  inside the painting structure. I hope it will soon be possible
                  to dedicate another paper to this topic.

                  to solve certain complex problems on a large-size painting on

                  “We are firmly convinced that there cannot be a single method
                  valid for every painting—not only for obvious reasons related
                  to the nature of the work, but above all because of the
                  individual ‘character’ of the painting, with its ‘own’ fabric,
                  its ‘own’ ground preparation, its ‘own’ pigment and its ‘own’
                  reaction to the passage of time. It follows that if there is
                  no single method and no single material appropriate to every
                  picture, it must and will be for the painting itself to impose
                  a careful choice between the various methods and materials”
                  ([[Baldini and Taiti 2003|, 115]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The quotation above is an excerpt from Sergio Taiti and
                  Umberto Baldini’s address at the Greenwich lining conference
                  in 1974. Sergio Taiti had been chief conservator for
                  structural treatments on canvas at Opificio delle Pietre Dure
                  of Florence for about twenty years and during his tenure he
                  distinguished himself for having a deep sensitivity toward the
                  specific characteristics of paintings. We didn’t have the
                  opportunity to meet him in person, but we had our training in
                  canvas conservation with Luciano Sostegni, who worked closely
                  with him for a long time and became his successor at the
                  Fortezza da Basso’s Laboratories. Although our profession led
                  us to test and use new and different materials and methods,
                  his teachings remain the basis for our approach to work and we
                  are still firmly convinced of their validity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe that preliminary study of a painting, in order to
                  deeply understand its materials and technique as well as its
                  present condition, is essential to define customized
                  treatments for conservation. From this point of view, we try
                  not to focus on only a single material or methodology;
                  instead, during the preliminary decision-making phase, we
                  usually take into account a wide range of possibilities. By
                  doing so, we allow ourselves the chance to decide to employ
                  different materials in different ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moreover, we consider the minimal intervention approach as our
                  guide, but we believe that some clarification about this
                  matter is needed. We think that the <em>minimum</em> should
                  definitely be calibrated to the specific needs of the artwork,
                  in order to solve its conservation problems, slow its
                  degradation process, and try to avoid further treatments in
                  the near future. If keeping the treatment to a minimum means
                  minimizing the impact of conservation on the artwork, we
                  should consider only treatments that actually solve the
                  identified problems. For example, neglecting to guarantee the
                  color or the priming layers’ adhesion to the original support
                  effectively might lead the painting to undergo another
                  conservation treatment within a short time, and this will
                  probably result in a more stressful and invasive practice in
                  the end. At this point, can we say that we have kept our
                  treatment to the minimum needed, or should we admit that what
                  we have done is not enough appropriate to the conservation
                  needs of that individual artwork?
                </p>
                <p>
                  For a decade we have adopted and promoted a diagnostic
                  protocol<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  aimed at defining a more accurate and objective situation to
                  provide additional information to help the conservator (with
                  his own experience) in choosing a more appropriate
                  methodology, specifically suited to the artwork’s structural
                  conservation conditions.

                  The painting by Allesandro Allori represents the
                  <em>Allegory with the Triumph of Florence</em> and measures
                  about thirty square meters. It was created in 1588–89 to
                  celebrate the marriage of Ferdinando I, grand duke of Tuscany,
                  to Christine of Lorraine, and was located outdoors, above the
                  arch of the Florentine Porta al Prato. The scene was painted
                  with a leanly bound oil, applied in thin and even layers. The
                  fine linen canvas was made of four pieces, whose selvages were
                  positioned horizontally and sewn together. The support was
                  prepared with a thin, light gray ground, probably using animal
                  glue and a little linseed oil as a binder.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When we first examined the painting, it was in storage at the
                  Pitti Palace. The canvas was mounted on a three-part folding
                  wooden stretcher ([<strong>fig. 11.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/fig-11-1)),
                  probably provided after the canvas was lined with a glue-paste
                  adhesive in the early part of the twentieth century. The
                  painting suffered new damage during the flood of Florence in
                  1966: it was partially impregnated with water, mud, and
                  naphtha (which had leaked from buildings’ heating systems and
                  was carried by the flood water), and diffused biological
                  growth developed. Repeated handling of the folded painting
                  over time had led to the permanent deformation of the original
                  canvas along the perimeter, resulting in a 15-cm extension at
                  the edges compared to the middle area of the support width.
                  The old lining adhesion was compromised, with evident and
                  diffused blistering. Over two hundred new tears, cuts, and
                  holes weakened the canvas and some patches had been glued to
                  the back of the lining, using animal glue or wax-resin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thick mud residues, molds, and patches were also visible on
                  the front. The original seams appeared partially ripped and
                  deformed, and extensive fillings and retouching on the paint
                  layers were mostly applied on these areas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  The painting had been folded with the painted side face in.
                  and this led to the detachment and loss of thousands of paint
                  fragments. After the flood, an attempt to fix unstable paint
                  layers was carried out using wax. This led to the complete
                  waterproofing of some localized areas, especially around the
                  seams joining the pieces of the original canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main problems to solve were reducing the huge deformations
                  of the canvas, restoring the compromised structural integrity
                  of the support, providing a good adhesion between the paint
                  layers and the original canvas and, finally, the evaluation of
                  the ability of the support to undergo a new tensioning on the
                  stretcher, considering its large size and significant weight.

                  To define the methodological choices and the materials to use,
                  compatibility with the original materials, use of minimum
                  amounts of new materials, and future reversibility were all
                  considered. Since full reversibility of binding agents for
                  consolidation or adhesives that impregnate the paint layers is
                  often impossible, it was important to us to leave open the
                  possibility to use a wide range of materials in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Three main operating activities to reflect on were identified:
                  the facing, the re‑adhesion of the paint layers to the
                  support, and the lining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  These three phases are clearly separate, even if strongly
                  interconnected, especially with regard to facing and
                  consolidation. This is due not only to the need for
                  compatibility with the painting materials, but above all for
                  the intimate connection taking place during the intervention.
                  Treating the canvas from the back with an adhesive to fix
                  flaking paint layers will probably lead to the impregnation of
                  the faced surface. It is then crucial to consider products
                  with similar properties and solubility—or at least to evaluate
                  the possible interactions of materials. This is important to
                  ensure the correct and easy removal of the facing. For that
                  reason, theoretical considerations were thought over and tests
                  were run to select the best material to solve the specific
                  problems mentioned above.
                </p>

                  In order to facilitate the flattening of the canvas and to be
                  sure of safeguarding the appearance of the lean oil technique,
                  an aqueous method was preferred and adhesives like extra-fine
                  rabbit skin glue and Aquazol were tested.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before facing the surface, dust and mud residue were carefully
                  removed using soft brushes and swabs with deionized water.
                  Some local preventive fixing was needed to avoid color losses.
                  Old fills and retouching were eliminated, mold was removed,
                  and the areas affected were disinfected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the surface facing, a first flattening of the canvas’s
                  deformation was possible, thanks to the moisture added by the
                  aqueous adhesive and to some light tensioning provided by the
                  contraction of Japanese paper while drying ([<strong>fig. 11.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/fig-11-2)).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using a polystyrene roller, the painting was then turned
                  facedown to work on the back and remove the old lining adhered
                  with glue-paste.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  The residue of the old glue-paste was carefully removed with a
                  scalpel. In some problematic areas where the adhesive was
                  particularly tough, an agar gel<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  was used to swell and soften it, making removal easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All cuts were brought back to the correct position with the
                  aid of tension, applied using tie-beams adjusted by rubber
                  bands ([<strong>fig. 11.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/fig-11-3)),
                  and moisture, released through a Gore-Tex fabric. Polyester
                  fabric tie-beams were adhered to the back of the canvas with
                  original formula Beva 371 film. The humidification, tension,
                  and time needed were related to the extent of deformation
                  being treated. A polyester thread was used to resew the
                  selvages where necessary, passing through the holes of the
                  original seam, when possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many cycles of humidification and tension were needed to
                  flatten the canvas. Due to the very large size of the
                  painting, stretching it on a temporary loom was deemed
                  expensive and impractical, so it was decided to tension it on
                  a thin worktop placed directly on the floor. To do this,
                  strips of polyester canvas<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  were fixed to the perimeter with Beva 371 film, reactivated at
                  two different times: the first on the polyester canvas, at
                  80°C, and the second, on the back of the original canvas, at
                  65°C. This particular procedure is intended to create a
                  stronger bond between the adhesive and the polyester canvas
                  than between the adhesive and the original canvas, ensuring
                  better reversibility in the future. Ideally, no adhesive will
                  be left on the original canvas when the strips are removed; at
                  worst, only a few traces will remain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A complex problem we needed to solve was recovering the
                  adhesion of paint layers that had been treated with wax or
                  impregnated with nonpolar substances in the past, using an
                  aqueous adhesive. This was preferred to help the flattening of
                  the original canvas and to guarantee the easy removal of the
                  facing. Tests were performed to evaluate the strength of the
                  bond produced by extra-fine rabbit skin glue, sturgeon glue
                  and Aquazol 500 and 200 dissolved in water, ethanol, and
                  acetone. Aquazol 500 in acetone showed good adhesion
                  properties on wax samples.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  To adhere the paint layers to the original canvas, two coats
                  of Aquazol 500 were applied at two distinct times. First,
                  Aquazol 500 in acetone at 10%<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  was applied to guarantee good adhesion of the areas that
                  presented wax and nonpolar substances. Later, a second
                  application of the same resin dissolved at 5% in a solution of
                  acetone and water (1:1) was used to effectively increase the
                  flattening of the canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the complete evaporation of solvents, always keeping the
                  painting tensioned,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  the thermoplastic adhesive was reactivated by heat in a vacuum
                  bag (envelope). Heat was transferred to the adhesive using
                  water at a predetermined temperature, provided by a movable
                  temporary “tub.” The materials needed to carry out this
                  intervention are shown in [<strong>fig. 11.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/fig-11-4).
                  The painting was placed facedown in a vacuum bag made of
                  silicone-coated polyester film (Melinex). On the top of this
                  bag, a tub made of a Melinex sheet placed in a wooden loom<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  was prepared. A certain volume of water, preheated to a
                  predetermined temperature, was poured into the tub. After ten
                  minutes,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  the water was removed, and the tub was shifted to treat
                  another area. This operation was repeated to treat the whole
                  surface, always keeping the painting under pressure in the
                  vacuum bag.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s important to underline that this method is not an
                  alternative to the use of a hot table, but it permits heat
                  transfer from the back also when working with the painting
                  facedown is required.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  Using a vacuum system and applying heat through a tub
                  containing pre-heated water guarantees that the whole surface
                  is treated with the same pressure and temperature,
                  substantially reducing the risk of nonhomogeneous performance
                  of the thermoplastic adhesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In preparation for mending structural damages, some adhesives
                  were tested ([<strong>table 11.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/table-11-1)).
                  To avoid damage to the original canvas in the future, the
                  breaking point of the adhesive should be equal to or slightly
                  less than the toughness value of the original yarn (see
                  [[Orata 2009]]), measured by tension test with a dynamometer.
                  The adhesive with a breaking point that is similar to that of
                  the original yarn is highlighted in red in the table.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All the cuts, tears, and holes (more than two hundred) were
                  mended thread by thread using Akeogard AT35<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
                  applied with a tiny brush, using an optical visor. All the
                  structural damages and the four seams were further reinforced
                  by applying monofilament fabric patches adhered with a mixture
                  made of 80% Plextol B500 and 20% Dispersion K360, reactivated
                  by butyl acetate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the first steps of consolidation, tear mending, and
                  humidification complete, we evaluated if lining was really
                  necessary. A series of elements, such as the dimension of the
                  canvas in relation to its ability to support itself, the
                  presence of more than two hundred structural damages, the
                  advanced degradation of the cellulose, and the presence of
                  four horizontal seams, led us to the decision to apply an
                  auxiliary support. As mentioned, every case is unique, and
                  sometimes it is appropriate to assess the use of different
                  methods and materials for lining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Glue-paste lining did not seem suitable, not only because it
                  would increase the weight of the whole structure, but also
                  (mostly) due to the difficulty in maintaining the appearance
                  of the painted surface, preventing the seams’ stitches from
                  impressing on the front, and preserving the original seams.
                  Lining with Beva 371 was also discarded due to the evaporation
                  of a large amount of solvent (such as toluene) during the
                  operation. Cold lining, using the Mehra system, was just as
                  risky for the large amount of butyl acetate (or similar
                  solvent) needed to reactivate Plextol.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                  Using a thermoplastic adhesive in aqueous dispersion appeared
                  to be a good solution to avoid the use of a fair amount of
                  solvent, with its attendant risks of toxicity and fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A study focused on testing different adhesives obtained by
                  mixing Plextol B500 and Dispersion K360,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  in different proportions, was carried out to obtain a final
                  mixture to be reactivated by heating. Empirical tests were
                  performed to define the approximate reactivation temperature
                  and the reversibility of each mixture ([[Orata and Capellaro
                  2013]]|, 57–66) in order to identify the one that would better
                  fit the features and conservative conditions of the painting
                  (<strong>[table

                  acrylic-based class of adhesives very advantageous in devising
                  innovative solutions.

                  Samples 1 and 2 are tests on the two pure resins (see [<strong>table 11.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/table-11-2)).
                  Each mixture was sprayed on a polyester canvas mock-up. After
                  solvent evaporation, each was joined to a linen canvas mock-up
                  in order to simulate the real conditions of use. The mock-ups
                  were then placed in a vacuum bag and lined by increasing the
                  temperature incrementally starting at 40°C going up to 80°C,
                  applying a constant vacuum of 700 mbar. After each 10-degree
                  increase, the bag was opened, each mock-up was tested, and the
                  degree of adhesion was evaluated. Sample 4, composed of 30%
                  Dispersion K360 and 70% Plextol B500, reactivated between 60°C
                  and 70°C (shown in red in [<strong>table 11.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/table-11-2))
                  was the one that showed a good combination of adhesion and
                  reversibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This adhesive was sprayed on the stretched polyester
                  canvas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>
                  Particular attention was paid to maintaining the correct
                  tension of the lining canvas during the whole process. In
                  fact, during the reactivation of the thermoplastic adhesive,
                  the lining canvas was stretched again on the worktop to
                  maintain the orthogonal orientation of the warp and weft
                  threads and to avoid the transfer of undesirable tensions to
                  the painting during the final stretching phase. If the lining
                  canvas is not tensioned when applying the adhesive and when
                  the lining is adhered to the original canvas, its threads will
                  remain more extensible. When the lined painting is finally
                  stretched on the definitive stretcher, more tension would be
                  required to first stretch those loose threads, before
                  transferring tension to the whole lined support. This
                  excessive tension could result in damage to the original
                  canvas, which is usually less elastic than the new lining
                  canvas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before lining the painting facedown in the vacuum system, it
                  was necessary to fill the biggest losses with stucco, to avoid
                  the original canvas being pushed towards the paint surface,
                  where paint layers were missing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The adhesion of new canvas was carried out in a vacuum bag
                  (envelope), with the painting placed facedown on a worktop.
                  Nonwoven fabric<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>
                  was used as a cushioning layer, to preserve the thin
                  brushstrokes, keeping the seams on the back at the same time.
                  The adhesive was reactivated by placing 70°C water inside a
                  loom and treating circumscribed areas of about 1 square meter
                  using the tub system described earlier and outlined in
                  [<strong>fig. 11.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/fig-11-4).
                  To stretch the canvas on the final expandable stretcher, the
                  painting was positioned facedown to reduce the forces applied
                  at the edges.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not all the losses were filled and retouched, because the art
                  historian who directed the conservation treatment chose to
                  leave a historical memory of the flood of Florence. When the
                  treatment was finished, the painting was exhibited at the
                  Medici Chapels in Florence ([<strong>fig. 11.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/11-Lavorini/11-Lavorini_clean/fig-11-5)).

                <p>
                  The methodologies described above are only some examples of
                  solutions outlined to solve specific conservation issues on
                  large-size paintings, but they represent the way we approach
                  the work, focusing on the artwork, which always has its own
                  requirements as a result of the properties of its original
                  materials and subsequent history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe that no best or worst methodology exists, but a
                  specific and suited intervention should be applied based on a
                  deep understanding of both the painting technique and the
                  conservation history of the artwork. A protocol of scientific
                  analysis helps to identify and quantify structural damages,
                  and then to decide, together with the experience gained with
                  practice, which conservation strategy is more appropriate to
                  solve the specific problem, regardless of tradition,
                  inclination, or current trends.

                        Elastic modulus is a measure of stiffness, defining the
                        relationship between stress and strain in a material.
                        The elastic modulus of the original canvas is usually
                        quite different than the modulus of the new lining
                        canvas. In our experience of tensioning new lining
                        canvases, we have found that new canvas (whether made of
                        natural or synthetic fibers) is usually more elastic
                        than the original.

                  During the 2016 conservation of Puvis de Chavannes’s
                  <em>Philosophy</em> mural, one of nine canvases commissioned
                  for the Boston Public Library and marouflaged to the wall in
                  1896, it was discovered that water infiltration had resulted
                  in detachment of up to 80% of the canvas from the wall. After
                  successful stabilization, facing, and removal from the wall,
                  the painting was prepared with a fabric interleaf for
                  marouflage onto a custom-built aluminum honeycomb panel for
                  reinstallation into its niche. The failure of the panel,
                  however, necessitated complete reversal of the marouflage and
                  replacement of the panel constructed with a stronger epoxy
                  adhesive. In this paper, the procedure to safely remove the
                  faced, but stiff and brittle mural from the panel is
                  described. The difficulty of carrying out the reversal led to
                  the modification of the Beva 371 formula for the reattachment
                  of the mural in order to facilitate future reversal, should
                  the need arise.

                <p>
                  Since its introduction by Gustav A. Berger in the early 1970s,
                  Beva 371 has been widely used as an adhesive for the lining of
                  easel paintings and the mounting of murals onto rigid supports
                  ([[Berger and Russell 2000]]). As it is a relatively recent
                  introduction to the field of paintings conservation, the
                  necessity of reversing a Beva 371 lining is an uncommon
                  occurrence. While the reversal of paintings lined onto canvas
                  supports with Beva 371 can be somewhat demanding, the removal
                  of a large-scale mural painting adhered to a rigid support
                  with Beva 371 presents the conservator with an extraordinary
                  set of challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the application of heat and solvents, canvas lining
                  fabrics can be peeled away from the reverse of an easel
                  painting, but rigid support panels cannot, therefore different
                  strategies must be devised. The strong adhesive properties of
                  Beva 371 and its rather high activation temperature further
                  complicate the procedure. The adhesive used for the marouflage
                  procedure described in this essay is Beva 371b, which replaced
                  the original Berger formulation in 2010. Laropal K80 (BASF), a
                  tackifier in the original adhesive, was discontinued in 2008.
                  In the reformulated Beva 371b, “an aldehyde ketone resin” was
                  substituted for it ([[Conservator’s Products Company 2010]]).

                  In 2016, Puvis de Chavannes’s <em>Philosophy</em> mural
                  ([<strong>fig. 12.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/12-Hodkinson%20Pocobene/fig-12-1)),
                  one of nine monumental murals the artist painted for the Grand
                  Staircase of the Boston Public Library in 1895–96, underwent a
                  major conservation campaign. Delamination of the 435.6 x 217.8
                  cm mural canvas and failure of the underlying plaster
                  necessitated emergency removal of the mural from the wall,
                  mounting of the canvas onto a rigid support panel, and
                  reinstallation in its niche. The project was presented by the
                  authors at the 2017 AIC Conference General Session in Chicago;
                  however, time constraints did not permit a thorough discussion
                  of the unexpected failure of the aluminum honeycomb panel
                  support during the lining procedure. This necessitated the
                  reversal of the marouflage lining and replacement of the panel
                  with one of better design and materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to describing the procedure implemented to reverse
                  the marouflage and the successful remounting of the mural
                  canvas, the logistical complications of undertaking such a
                  procedure are presented in this paper. The difficulty of
                  carrying out the reversal led to a reassessment of using Beva
                  371b as recommended by the manufacturers. Tests conducted on
                  mock-up panels led to a modification of the adhesive to reduce
                  its strength, tack, and melting point—and by extension
                  increased its reversibility—while still retaining its
                  essential properties as a suitable marouflage lining adhesive.

                <h2 id="project-overview" tabindex="-1">Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                  The murals in the grand staircase of the Boston Public Library
                  were painted on canvas by Puvis de Chavannes in Paris. The
                  artist achieved his famed fresco-like surfaces by using
                  various innovative techniques, including painting on a coarse,
                  plain-weave linen canvas; priming the canvas with animal glue
                  size; applying an extremely thin, absorbent chalk ground bound
                  in animal glue; draining his oils by placing them on blotting
                  paper; thinning his paints with turpentine; adding extensive
                  amounts of white lead to his color mixtures; and leaving the
                  mural surfaces unvarnished ([[Hensick, Olivier, and Pocobene
                  1997]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upon completion, the reverse of each mural was primed with red
                  lead in oil, rolled, shipped to Boston, and mounted to the
                  plaster walls using the marouflage technique ([<strong>fig. 12.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/12-Hodkinson%20Pocobene/fig-12-2)).
                  The original method of attachment was to adhere the canvas to
                  the wall with a paste of lead white in linseed oil applied to
                  both the wall and the back of the canvas painting, which was
                  then pressed onto the wall with rollers. While the adhesive
                  was curing, the canvas was secured around the perimeter by a
                  series of metal tacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In late 2014, a large canvas bulge and undulations were
                  discovered in the upper portions of the mural. Salt
                  efflorescence observed on the surrounding marble confirmed
                  moisture infiltration. None of this was a surprise, as the
                  mural has had a history of moisture problems, as noted in 1993
                  when the Puvis de Chavannes murals were last conserved by the
                  Straus Center for Conservation, Harvard Art Museums
                  ([[Hensick, Olivier, and Pocobene 1997]]). Mapping of the
                  mural surface revealed that nearly 80% of the canvas had
                  separated from the plaster substrate, yet along the left and
                  bottom edges, the canvas was still very firmly attached to the
                  wall.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, a large area of the plaster substrate had also
                  detached from the wall structure and was exerting considerable
                  outward pressure on the canvas, raising fears of catastrophic
                  failure. The plaster substrate consisted of expanded metal
                  lath coated with three plaster layers: scratch coat, brown
                  coat, and finishing coat, all composed of lime plaster of
                  approximately 2.2 cm total thickness. Inserting a microspatula
                  between the canvas and plaster instantly shattered the paint
                  film, indicating that the canvas and ground were extremely
                  brittle. This also confirmed that the adhered portions of
                  canvas could not be separated from the plaster without
                  incurring considerable damage to the paint surface.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Given the brittleness of the mural layers, the stiff white
                  lead marouflage adhesive, and the strong bond where the canvas
                  remained adhered to the wall, detaching and rolling the mural
                  canvas off the plaster was clearly impossible. To prevent
                  damage, the only viable approach was to totally detach the
                  mural canvas along with the attached plaster portions from the
                  metal lath substrate while keeping it as much in plane as
                  possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The basic concept of detaching the mural is straightforward:
                  support the mural at the top while detaching it starting at
                  the bottom. Though the approach is simple in concept, numerous
                  challenges became immediately evident.

                    <p>
                      As the mural was in a recess, the edges of the canvas
                      could not be accessed.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Limited access could be provided at the bottom, but only
                      if the marble fascia below the mural was removed.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      It was unclear how to support the painting and failed
                      plaster in the arch area while separating the mural from
                      the wall to reveal the bottom edge.

                      It would be necessary to coordinate application of facings
                      and removal of the oak trim within the arch without
                      collapse of the structure.

                    <p>
                      At some point, the plaster would need to be severed to
                      release the mural where it was still firmly attached.

                      The best type of protective facing materials and adhesives
                      to use to protect the painting during the trauma of
                      removal and subsequent structural work had to be
                      determined.

                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  As rolling the mural off the wall was deemed to be too
                  dangerous, a system had to be devised to keep the mural in
                  plane as much as possible during detachment. After
                  considerable testing and experimentation with scaled mock-ups,
                  the process of detaching the mural from the wall was carried
                  out. The mural was faced first with Kozo (Usu Mino) paper
                  sheets (after thorough testing for reversibility on mock-ups)
                  and a specially formulated emulsion adhesive consisting of the
                  following:
                </p>
                <ul>

                    <p>
                      20 parts Golden MSA-UVLS Matte Varnish (chosen for its
                      relatively low toxicity, ease of removal, and
                      detectability under UV light)
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>2 parts odorless mineral spirits</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>1 part distilled water</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The adhesive was emulsified with water to wet the paper fibers
                  so they could conform to the paint topography.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Belgian linen was chosen as the primary facing material for
                  the mural. Strips measuring 1&nbsp;x 4 feet were adhered using the
                  same MSA-UVLS mixture used for the Kozo paper facing,
                  strengthened by incorporating 20% Beva Gel. Where maximum
                  stress was anticipated, such as the perimeter of the mural and
                  the vertical joins of the linen facing, additional linen
                  reinforcement strips were adhered with Beva 371b.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At this point, the most nerve-wracking component of the
                  project could begin: the detachment of the mural from the
                  wall. The mural was secured at the top with padded plywood
                  forms and pressure clamps. Working from the bottom up, the
                  mural portions still firmly attached to the plaster wall were
                  detached by severing the plaster from the metal lath substrate
                  using modified slate rippers and vibration applied with a
                  rubber mallet through a padded plywood sheet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the mural became detached, linen facing flaps extending
                  beyond the perimeter of the mural were wrapped and stapled to
                  the lightweight support panels. As the work proceeded up the
                  surface, more panels were affixed and locked together to keep
                  the mural in plane. Finally, with much of the mural supported
                  by the locked panel supports, the section within the arch was
                  detached. Once the entire mural was fully detached,
                  full-length vertical and horizontal wood stiffeners were
                  attached to the panel support system ([<strong>fig. 12.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/12-Hodkinson%20Pocobene/fig-12-3)).
                  A block-and-tackle system was connected from the staging to
                  the rigid frame support on the mural to guide it out. The
                  supported mural was then lowered, slowly coming to rest face
                  down on the staging deck. The mural was then removed from the
                  deck and transported to a specially modified treatment space
                  within the Boston Public Library.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The history of water leaks behind the mural precluded the
                  possibility of remounting the mural onto a new plaster wall,
                  so the decision was made to marouflage the mural onto a rigid
                  panel support that could be easily installed—and deinstalled
                  in the future, if necessary. The plaster remnants on the verso
                  were removed using first a reciprocating multitool to cut
                  through the bulk of the plaster, followed by mechanical
                  removal of the harder 3 mm–finish coat using chisels. The
                  lead-white adhesive was well bound, uniform, and strongly
                  adhered to the reverse of the mural canvas, leaving none of
                  the canvas exposed, thus it was left undisturbed. In
                  preparation for lining, the reverse of the mural canvas was
                  sealed with one coat of warm Beva 371b diluted with
                  low-aromatic mineral spirits following the manufacturer’s
                  instructions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Belgian linen canvas (8.7 oz) was then prepared as an
                  interleaf for the lining assembly. A stiffer, synthetic
                  material with a bonded weave (such as polyester sailcloth or
                  Sunbrella fabric) would have been preferable, but fabric wide
                  enough to span the width of the mural was not available. The
                  Belgian linen was stretched on a wood frame and then sized and
                  stiffened with a mixture of equal parts Titebond wood glue and
                  water. A coat of warm Beva 371b was then rolled onto one side
                  of the Belgian linen and allowed to dry. The fabric was then
                  positioned over the back of the mural adhesive side down and
                  secured with heat from an iron applied through silicone-coated
                  polyester film (Mylar). A layer of warm Beva 371b was then
                  applied to the exposed side of the linen interleaf and allowed
                  to dry. This surface would be bonded to the honeycomb panel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The canvas mural, with the linen interleaf attached to it and
                  still on its panel support structure, was then turned face up
                  and placed onto a specially constructed worktable. The wood
                  braces and support panels were removed to reveal the faced
                  surface of the mural. The canvas facings were removed from the
                  mural surface with combinations of mineral spirits and xylenes
                  to dissolve the Golden MSA-based adhesive and Beva 371b, but
                  the Kozo paper facings were left on the mural for the time
                  being.

                  Adhesion to the New Rigid Support
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Considerable thought was given to the approach and materials
                  to be used for remounting the mural. From the outset it was
                  decided to reattach the mural to a rigid support. This would
                  respect the artist’s intent to marouflage and would provide
                  continuous support for the heavy canvas. For this, an aluminum
                  honeycomb panel was specially fabricated. In addition to
                  providing the necessary rigidity, the conductivity of the
                  aluminum would also facilitate the transfer of heat through
                  its structure for lining at the recommended temperature of
                  65°C.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Given the size of the mural, the marouflage was to be carried
                  out in four successive sections. A 122 x 244 cm
                  temperature-controlled, silicone rubber heat sheet placed
                  beneath the panel would deliver the required heat to each
                  section ([<strong>fig. 12.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/12-Hodkinson%20Pocobene/fig-12-4)).
                  Before heat was applied, trial runs were performed to ensure
                  that enough vacuum pressure could be applied over the entire
                  Dartek film envelope. This was achieved using two small vacuum
                  pumps placed on either side of the panel, which were connected
                  with plastic tubing to 1.25 cm polypropylene cord running
                  along the outer edge of the panel. In the final trial, the
                  mural and all the adhesion components were sealed with Dartek
                  film, and the required suction successfully applied. Once we
                  were confident that this method would work as intended,
                  marouflage of the mural could proceed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In preparation for lining, the worktable was covered with
                  sheets of double reflective insulation (Reflectix) to reduce
                  heat loss during the heating process. The
                  temperature-controlled silicone rubber heat sheet was
                  positioned for the adhesion of the first section at the bottom
                  of the mural. Lastly, a coat of warm Beva 371b was applied to
                  the face of the honeycomb panel, thus ensuring that the
                  surfaces to be bonded were coated with a layer of the
                  adhesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mural was positioned onto the honeycomb panel, sealed with
                  Dartek film, and then transferred onto the silicone rubber
                  heat sheet. The vacuum pumps were attached with quick-release
                  vacuum connectors, the heat sheet was turned on, and metalized
                  reflective Mylar was placed over the section to retain heat.
                  Once the paint surface temperature of all areas of the section
                  reached 65^°^C, the heat was turned off and the bonded area
                  allowed to cool down.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Everything appeared to have gone exactly as intended, but when
                  the reflective Mylar was pulled back, a series of small bulges
                  not present at the beginning of the heating process had
                  developed along the center structural join of the panel
                  ([<strong>fig. 12.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/12-Hodkinson%20Pocobene/fig-12-5)).
                  The cause of the deformations was delamination of the aluminum
                  skins. The same problem was also discovered on the reverse of
                  the panel, raising questions about what had caused the panel
                  failure and how to proceed. Would we continue with the process
                  in the hope that the rest of the panel would remain intact, or
                  should the procedure be abandoned? Because the panel was
                  intended to support the mural over the long term, we could not
                  in good conscience continue to adhere the mural to what was
                  clearly a structurally compromised support.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Boston Public Library was informed of this unfortunate
                  setback, and in collaboration with the panel manufacturer we
                  began to investigate the cause of the problem. At the same
                  time, we started to formulate a strategy for the removal of
                  the mural from the failed panel for remounting onto a new,
                  structurally sound rigid support.

                  Reversal of the Failed Beva 371b Marouflage
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The first order of business was to detach the 122 x 213.5 cm
                  section of mural canvas now adhered to the failed panel. As
                  the linen facing layer had been removed prior to the lining
                  procedure, the section was refaced with linen to protect and
                  support the paint layers. The fact that almost 2.8 square
                  meters of the mural was adhered to the panel, while the rest
                  was not, greatly complicated the approach to reversing the
                  adhesion. Whereas solvents can be applied to the back of
                  canvas-lined paintings to dissolve Beva 371b, in this case
                  that would not be possible. The notion of delivering heat
                  through the front of the mural to release it was rejected
                  because of the excessive temperature needed penetrate the
                  paint layers and melt the adhesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some thought was given to the possibility of turning the mural
                  on its face and dismantling the panel behind it down to the
                  aluminum skin it was attached to, but that would be easier
                  said than done. Attempting to then release the remaining
                  adhered aluminum skin with heat from the reverse would have
                  proven extremely difficult, as only a small area could be
                  detached at a time. This approach was also rejected because of
                  the difficulty of handling the aluminum skin and the
                  considerable risk of damage to the brittle paint and ground
                  layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The only feasible approach was to reheat the entire bonded
                  portion of mural and then to roll the canvas off the panel
                  when the Beva 371b adhesive reached its release temperature.
                  Before any such attempt was made, however, small-scale
                  replicas of the partially adhered mural were made, and from
                  these tests, a suitable approach was devised. Affixing the
                  bottom edge of the linen interleaf under the mural to the
                  equivalent of a very large diameter Sonotube, and then slowly
                  rolling back the mural when the release temperature was
                  reached, was deemed the most sensible tactic: it would support
                  the canvas, minimize distortion, and reduce stress to the
                  paint layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was empirically calculated that a tube with a diameter of
                  3.7&nbsp;m would be required to accomplish the task. That being
                  impractical, we decided to fabricate a section of such a tube
                  large enough to cover the area of the adhered section. A form
                  was fabricated by cutting 1.9&nbsp;cm plywood into curved ribs
                  attached to a frame ([<strong>fig. 12.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/12-Hodkinson%20Pocobene/fig-12-6)).
                  Lauan board (0.64&nbsp;cm thick), chosen for its pliable
                  characteristics, was then attached to the ribs to create the
                  outer, curved surface of the form, against which the mural
                  would be supported during the adhesion reversal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The curved plywood form was set over the mural and tied to 5 x
                  10 cm framing supports on either end with block-and-tackle
                  pulleys. This arrangement would enable the operators at the
                  four corners to slowly roll the curved form away from the
                  bottom edge in a controlled manner, until the entire section
                  was released. With the interleaf and linen facing tabs along
                  the bottom of the mural secured to the bottom edge of the
                  curved plywood form, the silicone heat sheet was turned on and
                  the surface temperature of the aluminum honeycomb panel raised
                  to 65^°^C.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the Beva 371b began to release, the bottom edge of the
                  curved panel form was slowly raised while the other end was
                  lowered, enabling the mural to be gently pulled away from the
                  honeycomb panel ([<strong>fig. 12.7</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/12-Hodkinson%20Pocobene/fig-12-7)).
                  This went according to plan; however, cool air flowing between
                  the surface of the panel and the underside of the linen
                  interleaf caused stringing of the Beva 371b adhesive, a
                  well-known occurrence in the hot-melt glue industry. As the
                  strings cooled, the resulting hardening of the adhesive
                  impeded the effort to pull the mural off the panel at an
                  effective pace. Severing the strings with a metal spatula as
                  they formed enabled the procedure to continue. The total time
                  to reverse the lining, from the moment of lifting the curved
                  form to complete detachment, took only four minutes. Critical
                  to the success of the reversal process was the presence of the
                  linen interleaf, which provided much needed support for the
                  mural and took the brunt of the applied stress.

                  Honeycomb Panel Redesign
                </h2>
                <p>
                  With the mural successfully detached from the honeycomb panel,
                  the next step in the process was to determine why the panel
                  had delaminated. The failed panel was fabricated with aluminum
                  skins (0.8 mm) supported with poplar strips for the outer
                  straight edges and medium-density fiberboard (Medex) edges cut
                  to the shape of the arch. The width of the mural, which
                  exceeded the width of available aluminum sheets, required a
                  vertical seam in the center of the panel, which had been
                  reinforced with 7.6 x 1.9 cm rectangular aluminum tube. The
                  core of the panel was filled with aluminum honeycomb to
                  provide rigidity and heat transfer. When the panel was
                  commissioned, it was made clear to the manufacturer that the
                  panel would be heated to 65^°^C–70^°^C and that an epoxy
                  adhesive able to tolerate that temperature needed to be used
                  in the fabrication of the panel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a review of the specifications and materials used to
                  make the panel, it was determined that several factors led to
                  its failure, including the type and amount of epoxy adhesive
                  applied to the various surfaces and the choice of edge
                  materials. In preparation for the fabrication of a stronger
                  panel, the manufacturer produced numerous small mock-ups with
                  various combinations of epoxies and edge materials. These were
                  then heated to the lining temperature under vacuum and
                  assessed for their structural integrity. Initially, many of
                  these failed, but based on the results of the experiments two
                  major changes were made to the construction of the panel.
                  First, an epoxy adhesive that would tolerate temperatures of
                  up to 80°C was obtained and successfully tested on mock-up
                  panels. Second, the poplar and Medex edging materials were
                  replaced with aluminum tube along the edges, which was also
                  used for cross bracing. Additionally, the center vertical seam
                  was reinforced with a 10 cm composite plate that spanned the
                  inside of the seam; it was composed of 1.27 cm Hexcel aluminum
                  honeycomb sandwiched between .125 cm 1/8 inch aluminum sheets.
                  This composition greatly stiffened the structure, and the new
                  panel was custom fabricated for the lining of the mural.

                  Modification of the Beva 371b Adhesive
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The challenges encountered during reversal of the partially
                  adhered portion of the mural led to a reconsideration of the
                  properties of Beva 371b: namely, its high strength and the
                  temperature needed to release it. Recently, Ploeger et al.
                  considered the strength of Berger’s adhesive formulation and
                  proposed the need for further research and development of
                  adhesives with reduced strength and activation temperature
                  ([[Ploeger, McGlinchey, and de la Rie 2015]]). As the entire
                  Puvis de Chavannes marouflage may need to be reversed at some
                  point in the future, thought was given to how conservators
                  would go about doing this and what could be done during the
                  present procedure to make that task less challenging. Once
                  mounted onto its rigid support panel, the mural canvas would
                  be in a relatively stress-free state, so such a high-strength
                  adhesive would not be necessary. The question was how to go
                  about reducing the strength and tack of Beva 371b while still
                  providing sufficient adhesion. Additionally, lowering the
                  activation temperature of the adhesive was deemed a desirable
                  characteristic, especially for the brittle paint and ground
                  layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As supplied by the manufacturer, paraffin wax makes up 9% of
                  Beva 371b. It was deduced that the addition of a
                  low-temperature paraffin wax to the stock solution would
                  reduce not only the activation temperature of the adhesive but
                  also the percentage of the other resins and tackifiers in the
                  solution, thereby reducing the adhesive’s strength. Empirical
                  tests were performed to determine if a modified adhesive with
                  these desirable properties could be produced. Using Beva 371b
                  dry resin mix, batches of the adhesive were weighed out and
                  dissolved in solvents according to the manufacturer’s
                  directions. They were then modified by adding 5% and 10% by
                  weight of paraffin wax. A paraffin wax with a melting
                  temperature of 50^°^C–54.4^°^C was chosen for testing. A
                  control sample of unmodified Beva 371b was also prepared for
                  comparison. Scrap samples of thick nineteenth-century
                  decorative canvas, along with linen interleaf fabrics, were
                  adhered to small honeycomb test panels. From the tests, it was
                  determined that it was possible to sufficiently adhere the
                  test samples at a much lower temperature of 54.4^°^C measured
                  at the paint surface. The tests also indicated that at the
                  interface between the aluminum panel and linen interleaf, the
                  temperature remained below 60^°^C
                </p>
                <p>
                  To determine if the adhered samples could be released with
                  less force, small, rigid cardboard tubes were attached to one
                  edge of the test samples and the panels heated until the
                  surface of the paint reached 54.4^°^ C. Whereas it was not
                  possible to roll back the unmodified Beva 371b at that
                  temperature, the 5% and 10% samples both released from the
                  aluminum panel, especially the latter, which could be rolled
                  back using relatively little force ([<strong>fig. 12.8</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/12-Hodkinson%20Pocobene/fig-12-8)).
                  Based on these empirical tests, it was decided to adhere the
                  mural with a Beva 371b solution modified with the addition of
                  10% paraffin by weight. Because the lead-white adhesive on the
                  reverse of the mural acted as a barrier, there was little
                  concern that the modified adhesive would darken the canvas
                  because of its increased flow.

                <p>
                  Assured that the new, redesigned honeycomb panel would
                  tolerate the lining process, the mounting of the mural
                  proceeded as originally conceived. A coat of the modified Beva
                  371b solution was applied to the surface of the new honeycomb
                  panel and allowed to dry. The linen and Kozo paper facings
                  were then removed from the mural surface. As previously
                  described, the mural assembly was wrapped in its Dartek vacuum
                  envelope. The first section of the mural was successfully
                  adhered to the panel using the modified Beva 371b adhesive at
                  a paint surface temperature of 54.4^°^C. Once cooled to room
                  temperature, the panel was temporarily lifted onto foam blocks
                  to reposition the silicone heat sheet under the next section
                  of the mural (see [<strong>fig. 12.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/12-Hodkinson%20Pocobene/fig-12-4)).
                  Section by section, the entire mural was successfully adhered
                  using this system. The Belgian linen edges extending beyond
                  the perimeter of the mural canvas were then wrapped around the
                  edges and over the back of the honeycomb panel and adhered
                  with Beva 371b using warm irons. Four heavy-duty metal
                  right-angle brackets (two on each side) were mounted with
                  epoxy and screws to the panel edges and back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After selective filling and retouching, the mural was
                  transported back to the staging for reinstallation. With just
                  3 mm of play on either side, the panel slid easily into its
                  niche. The mural was positioned and checked for level, and the
                  angle brackets were then screwed securely into corresponding
                  wood blocking mounted in the niche recess (see [<strong>fig. 12.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/12-Hodkinson%20Pocobene/fig-12-1)).

                <p>
                  Although the reversal of Beva 371 adhesion from rigid support
                  panels is a challenging process, the treatment undertaken on
                  the <em>Philosophy</em> mural demonstrates that methods can be
                  devised to carry out this type of procedure. While the
                  mid-treatment setback caused by the failed panel was in the
                  end successfully resolved, it raised questions about the
                  present formulation of Beva 371b and its working properties.
                  Research to date has explored certain properties of Beva 371,
                  such as its stability and its potential use on other types of
                  art. The process of reversing adhesion to rigid supports and
                  the resulting effects on the canvas and paint layers, however,
                  have not been thoroughly investigated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The original formula Beva 371 was specifically developed for
                  the lining and consolidation of paintings on canvas and has
                  been used with apparent success for that purpose for over half
                  a century. The revised formula, Beva 371b, continues to be an
                  invaluable adhesive in the conservation field, but it has its
                  own problems and limitations. Reevaluation of the adhesive,
                  along with systematic testing, is much needed. The replacement
                  of some of its components with new materials and resins could
                  lead to the production of adhesives with properties tailored
                  more appropriately to the job in hand, including adhesives of
                  various strengths. Moreover, an adhesive with a lower
                  activation temperature would be a welcome addition to the
                  lining and consolidation materials at our disposal.

                  Over the past decades, lining of paintings has become more and
                  more an <em>ultima ratio</em> measure in conservation
                  practice. In case of the painting
                  <em>Das Jüngste Gericht</em> (<em>The</em>
                  <em>Last Judgment</em>) by Engelbert Zimmermann, assessment
                  showed that only a lining would provide a sustainable
                  treatment. Due to a previous treatment, the support was
                  extremely brittle and had several large tears. The aim of the
                  conservation treatment was to stabilize the support while
                  preserving the original stretching system. To regain stability
                  of the support and readability of the depiction, the heavily
                  distorted support was remodeled, the tears were partially
                  closed, and the painting was lined using the mist-lining
                  technique. Where the original canvas was no longer fixed to
                  the stretcher, the lining canvas was introduced between the
                  support and the stretcher. After lining, the original and the
                  lining canvas were both fixed to the stretcher. In areas where
                  the original stretching system was still intact the lining
                  canvas was fixed a few millimetres inside the stretcher. The
                  treatment has made the depiction readable again and improved
                  the overall impression of the painting without neglecting its
                  history.

                <p>
                  After the influential talks by Vishwa Mehra and Westby
                  Percival-Prescott at the 1974 Comparative Lining Techniques
                  conference in Greenwich, the dangers of lining became clear to
                  everyone. Lining came to be understood more and more as a
                  massive, largely irreversible intervention in the structure of
                  the painting. The dangers of treatments involving heat and
                  moisture to alter the original surface were pointed out by
                  Mehra. Similarly, Percival‑Prescott described the lining cycle
                  as leading to constant material loss ([[Percival-Prescott
                  2003b]]). In addition, lined paintings often appear rigid and
                  flat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a consequence, part of the conservation world started to
                  further develop lining techniques and do research on the
                  mechanic behavior of canvases to diminish these adverse
                  effects. In contrast, Percival-Prescott himself went as far as
                  to postulate a need for a lining moratorium. A large part of
                  the community, especially in German-speaking countries adopted
                  this approach and turned away from lining in favor of
                  developing new methods. The most influential of these methods
                  is probably the thread-by-thread tear-mending propagated by
                  Winfried Heiber ([[Heiber 2003]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today in Germany, the preferred methods for structural
                  treatments are various forms of strip-lining and tear-mending,
                  and it is a common goal to avoid lining altogether.
                  Nonetheless, at the museum where Julia Brandt did her
                  pre-career internship, she was trained to execute several
                  lining techniques. Penetrating lining techniques were
                  sometimes seen as a time-saving option, as they combined
                  several steps in one, such as stabilizing the support and
                  adhering and flattening the paint layers. Cold linings and
                  nap-bond methods were seen as a good way to make paintings
                  save for travel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later in our academic training, lining was taught as a
                  historic technique, and the negative effects were clearly
                  pointed out. During our training at the Technical University
                  of Munich (TU München) we were taught not to perform a
                  technique just because we know it best, but to look at every
                  artwork individually. We were always asked to search for the
                  method that involved the least intervention and least impact
                  on the original substance. We found that this approach
                  challenges you to further develop existing techniques and to
                  invent new ones so that the practical part of the field also
                  grows into an academic discipline.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In most cases, even when paintings at first sight seem beyond
                  recovery, local treatments can offer sufficient and
                  sympathetic solutions. In our last year at university,
                  however, we were presented with a severely damaged painting—it
                  was basically torn in half ([<strong>fig. 13.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/13-Brandt/fig-13-1)).
                  While we first discussed the possibility of local treatments,
                  it became clear during the investigation that the painting
                  technique and the chosen canvas were probably the main causes
                  for the observed damage. At the same time, the painting didn’t
                  show any signs of previous treatment, which led to intensive
                  discussions on how far we could intervene with the original
                  substance.

                  The Painter Engelbert Zimmermann and His Totentanz Cycle
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The painting <em>The Last Judgment</em> is the central piece
                  of Engelbert Zimmermann’s Totentanz (danse macabre) series,
                  which is owned by the Stadtmuseum Wasserburg am Inn, a small
                  community museum in eastern Bavaria. The large-format
                  painting, which dates from the beginning of the nineteenth
                  century, had several horizontal tears, one of which divided
                  the support in half (see [<strong>fig. 13.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/13-Brandt/fig-13-1)).
                  The series was created in 1839 for the mortuary hall of the
                  Wasserburg cemetery and is based on a model by Hans Holbein
                  the Younger. His series Imagines Mortis (Images of Death)—does
                  not show the dance of Death with his victims as was customary
                  in the Middle Ages, but rather individual, self-contained
                  scenes accompanied by interpretative verses and Bible
                  quotations ([[Wunderlich 2010]]). The Totentanz from
                  Wasserburg is considered one of the few remaining monumental
                  cycles of this kind from the first half of the nineteenth
                  century ([[Sörries 1998|, 276]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Zimmermann was born in Wasserburg in 1807, the son of a
                  carpenter. He was enrolled in figure drawing at the Munich Art
                  Academy in 1827, but nothing is recorded about his further
                  career and very few paintings by him are known. The mortuary
                  hall was built in 1830 as part of the expansion and renovation
                  of the Wasserburg cemetery, and a few years later Zimmermann
                  was commissioned to furnish it. The cycle he created consists
                  of six rectangular paintings (135 x 85 cm), and a central
                  painting depicting the Last Judgment (225 x 130 cm).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Initially, a cycle of eighteen paintings was planned. In a
                  declaration from August 24 of the same year, however, the
                  number was reduced by half (and in the end, only seven seem to
                  have been executed); the free wall surfaces were to be filled
                  with aphorisms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Zimmermann states in the declaration that he wanted to paint
                  the paintings “for the sake of better durability [with] oil
                  paints on metal sheets.” But in the end all seven paintings
                  were executed on canvas. The painter added the corresponding
                  quotations from the Bible directly on the plaster under the
                  small paintings. For the central <em>Last Judgment</em>, the
                  text appears at the bottom of the canvas. The Bible quotations
                  and aphorisms are taken from an 1832 edition of Holbein’s
                  Imagines Mortis with texts by Joseph Schlothenhauer, a
                  professor at the Munich Art Academy ([[Von Perger 2013|,
                  201–3]]). Seen from the entrance of the hall, the four small
                  paintings depicting Death dancing with different individuals
                  hung to the left and right: On the left the child and the
                  bride, on the right the couple and the old man. At the front
                  wall, in a semicircular niche, hung <em>The</em>
                  <em>Last Judgment</em> flanked by
                  <em>Expulsion from Paradise</em> on the left and
                  <em>Skeletons Playing Music</em> on the right.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The paintings were individually photographed in 1919 and
                  published in the illustrated magazine <em>Das Bayerland</em>.
                  These are the only known photographs of the cycle in their
                  original arrangement in the mortuary hall. During the course
                  of the hall’s renovation in 1924, the Zimmermann cycle was
                  taken down and moved to the attic of the mortuary hall, and
                  the aphorisms were overpainted. After a publication by Otto
                  Kögl, who pointed out the importance and quality of
                  Zimmerman’s Totentanz, the Stadtmuseum Wasserburg took the
                  cycle into its collection in 1940 and exhibited it for some
                  time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Possibly in the 1960s, but at the latest in the 1980s, the
                  cycle was placed in storage at the museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  In 1998, two of the small-format paintings (<em>Skeletons Playing Music</em>
                  and <em>Death and the Old Man</em>) were shown in the
                  exhibition
                  <em>Tanz der Toten—Todestanz: Der monumentale Totentanz im
                    deutschsprachigen Raum</em>
                  in the Museum für Sepulkralkultur in Kassel, Germany
                  ([[Sörries 1998|, 41]]). The museum had requested a loan of
                  the whole cycle, but the other paintings were too damaged to
                  be exhibited.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2013, the painting was offered to the chair of
                  Conservation-Restoration to be treated by students, as the
                  museum did not have the funds to pay for the restoration. By
                  this point, it had not been accessible to the public for
                  several decades.

                  An Unusual Support with an Unusual Damage—Technological
                  Investigations
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The weave of the textile support of <em>The</em>
                  <em>Last Judgment</em> resembles a weft rib but actually is a
                  plain weave. The weft rib effect is created by the use of a
                  much thicker thread for every second weft ([<strong>fig. 13.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/13-Brandt/fig-13-2)).
                  This fabric structure can be found in all paintings of the
                  Totentanz. The canvas is made of jute and flax. Engelbert
                  Zimmermann possibly opted for this type of fabric with its
                  riblike weave because he wanted to create an effect similar to
                  a so-called tapestry painting: “[A] technique which aims at
                  the imitation of woven tapestries by painting. One uses a
                  riblike material corresponding to the texture of the real
                  tapestries and paints on it with water, tempera or oil paints
                  diluted with turpentine, after one has traced the drawing
                  beforehand or applied it with a charcoal pencil.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A few samples were taken to learn more about the painting
                  technique. In the cross section a layer of binding media
                  between the canvas and the ground was clearly visible.
                  Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  of a microprobe of the ground and binding media layer
                  suggested that shellac was used to prepare the canvas and that
                  the preparation contained chalk. The thin ground layer was
                  applied after embedding the canvas with shellac, and the
                  painting was then painted thin and lean, without varnish
                  coating. As is usual for tapestry painting, this allowed the
                  striking fabric structure to remain clearly visible. The
                  support was nailed frontally to the wooden strainer without a
                  tacking margin. The frame (which did not have a rabbet) was
                  nailed on top such that the support is sandwiched between the
                  strainer and the frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The shellac probably led to an increased oxidation of the
                  already thin warp threads, which had broken in numerous places
                  under the weight of the textile. Horizontal tears pervaded the
                  painting, and this damage phenomenon can also be observed on
                  the other paintings of the cycle. It was probably further
                  increased by the high temperatures in the attic where the
                  paintings were stored (temperatures up to 40°C were recorded).
                  The resin becomes soft at higher temperatures, so the support
                  loses its stiffness and begins to sag. This caused the canvas
                  in the larger central painting to detach from the strainer,
                  especially in the lower half, as the canvas ripped around the
                  nails, which allowed the lower half of the painting to droop.
                  At normal room temperature, the fabric was hard and brittle
                  and had completely lost its textile character. The condition
                  considerably impaired the readability of the representation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting was found in this state in 2012, when the
                  museum’s inventory was updated. A conservator who was called
                  to see if the painting could be rescued determined that the
                  support was so completely stiff and brittle that it was
                  impossible to bring the canvas back to its original shape
                  without causing further damage (see [<strong>fig. 13.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/13-Brandt/fig-13-1)).
                  He decided to wait for the warmer temperatures of summer to
                  loosen the stiffness, before turning the painting onto its
                  side to slightly reduce the strong deformations. The measure
                  was successful up to a point, but it was unclear how to go
                  about further stabilizing the support and reaffixing it to the
                  strainer ([<strong>fig. 13.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/13-Brandt/fig-13-3)).

                  The Bigger Picture—Setting Goals and Assessing Limitations
                </h2>
                <p>
                  After taking a closer look at the support of this painting and
                  the other paintings from the cycle, we came to the conclusion
                  that the drastic damage was primarily caused by technical
                  factors inherent to the work and less to external influences.
                  Even if it would not be part of our project, we would need to
                  find a method that would be easily applicable to all seven of
                  the paintings. We were told by the museum that they did not
                  have any storage space other than the one in the attic, which
                  had very high temperatures in summer and very low, almost
                  freezing conditions in winter. Additionally, the difficult
                  financial situation common to many small, community museums
                  implied the need for a low-cost solution; otherwise, it would
                  be very unlikely that the rest of the cycle could ever be
                  restored. Keeping all of this in mind, we also hoped that a
                  neater appearance would perhaps grant the large (and therefore
                  more vulnerable) central painting a spot in the collection,
                  which would mean better storage conditions. Hence our
                  preliminary goal was to make the depiction readable again and
                  to stabilize the support.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the painting had never undergone any major restoration
                  treatment in the past, we wanted to keep the impact on the
                  original substance as minimal as possible, and that meant
                  retaining the original stretching system. Due to the nature of
                  the support, thread-by-thread tear-mending, or even patches,
                  would not have provided a long-term solution. We were afraid
                  that the thin, brittle vertical threads would just break in
                  other places if we did not reinforce the support as a whole.
                  After looking at all the options and taking into account the
                  sparse financial resources, lining seemed to be the only
                  option.

                  The concept envisaged remodeling the deformed canvas, securing
                  the tears, and then lining the painting. This last step was
                  essential to stabilizing the support and relieving the strain
                  on the warp threads. Where the stretching system had already
                  failed, the lining canvas would need to be pushed between the
                  strainer and the original canvas and tensioned together with
                  the painting. In areas with an intact stretching system, the
                  lining canvas would be adhered just a few millimeters inside
                  the strainer. Both the securing of the tears and the lining
                  should be reversible, and it should also be possible to remove
                  the lining without opening the tears. The aim of the treatment
                  was not a perfectly smooth surface but rather a condition that
                  would make both the depiction and the history of the painting
                  visible.

                  Finding a Solution—Developing a Method
                </h2>
                <p>
                  From the first-aid measure taken in the attic in 2012, it was
                  known that the rigid canvas and the paint layer would become
                  more flexible under the influence of heat, but using a hot
                  spatula and moisture did not lead to a satisfactory result. We
                  decided to try heating a larger part of the surface, but it
                  still did not work as well as we had hoped. As the FTIR
                  analysis suggested shellac had been used to prepare the
                  canvas, we conducted some microtests with ethanol, which
                  resulted in a swelling of the resin layer. Given these
                  indications, we decided to use ethanol-drenched cardboard
                  along with a Gore‑Tex membrane under the painting, and an
                  infrared lamp as heat source from above, while the painting
                  was fixed to a Lascaux stretching frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following requirements were formulated for securing tears:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The adhesive should be easily reversible and yet withstand
                      shear and tensile forces. It should adhere to the
                      shellac-soaked backside and not be alcohol-based, to
                      prevent the resinous layer from dissolving.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The fabric should be thin but also dimensionally stable in
                      order to bring the tears together and keep them in plane.
                      Patches should not become apparent in the paint layer or
                      in the lining.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Stabiltex was chosen because it is very thin and at the same
                  time stable. This fabric was made of pure polyester and was
                  used in textile conservation for a long time, although it is
                  no longer available.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following requirements were formulated for the lining:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The lining fabric should be thin and yet stable, to enable
                      it to reduce the tensile load on the warp threads.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      It should be flexible enough to adapt to the likely
                      remaining deformations in the canvas.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The fabric should be available in the format of the
                      painting and, ideally, have a plain weave.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  For lining, both cotton and linen were considered at first.
                  The greater dimensional stability of linen was the decisive
                  factor for preferring it over the cheaper cotton.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The requirements for the lining adhesive were the same as
                  those for the patch adhesive, with some additions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      In addition, it should be possible to apply it over a
                      large area.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      A sprayable medium was considered advantageous to reduce
                      the amount of adhesive used.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The health and environmental risks posed by the solvent
                      should be kept as low as possible.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Finally, given the limited financial resources and the
                      size of the painting, the adhesive (as well as the fabric)
                      needed to be affordable.

                  A selection of natural and synthetic adhesives was tested for
                  these requirements: Beva 371 Film (thin), Lascaux 360 HV and
                  498 HV acrylic adhesives in different proportions, Plextol
                  D&nbsp;540<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  and Dispersion K&nbsp;360<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  mixed in different proportions, and Plexigum PQ 611<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  in Shellsol D&nbsp;40 were tested as adhesives for patches and
                  lining. The Beva 371 film was rejected due to its thickness
                  and the resulting low flexibility. Producing a thinner film
                  from Beva Gel was considered to pose a serious health risk due
                  to the necessary solvent. The Lascaux acrylic adhesives and
                  the Plextol mixtures gave the same results. As the Lascaux
                  products are more expensive, we decided to use a mixture of
                  Plextol D&nbsp;540 and Dispersion K&nbsp;360 in a 7:3 ratio. The mixture
                  was taken from literature on mist-lining ([[Seymour and Van
                  Och 2005]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Plexigum PQ&nbsp;611 fulfilled to a large extent all requirements,
                  but it is more difficult to process on large surfaces than
                  Plextol D&nbsp;540. It was therefore chosen for the patches, and
                  Plextol D&nbsp;540 in mixture with Dispersion K&nbsp;360 for the lining.
                  The different solubility of Plextol D&nbsp;540 and Plexigum PQ&nbsp;611
                  make it possible to remove the lining without removing the
                  patches from the tears.

                  From Theory to Practice
                </h2>
                <p>
                  After consolidating and cleaning the paint layer, we started
                  to put the support back into plane. Where the stretching
                  system had already failed, the loose edges of the painting
                  were clamped between two wood blocks upholstered with felt,
                  which had a piece of polyester strap attached to them. These
                  straps were fixed to a Lascaux stretcher ([<strong>fig. 13.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/13-Brandt/fig-13-4)).
                  An isopropanol compress—consisting of a Melinex film with
                  isopropanol-soaked blotting cardboard and a Gore-Tex
                  fleece—were put under the jacked-up painting. While the
                  alcohol vapors acted on the painting from below the surface
                  was heated with an infrared lamp for five&nbsp;minutes. An infrared
                  measuring device showed that the surface of the painting
                  heated up to approximately 40°C–45°C during this period. The
                  stretcher allowed us to stretch the remodeled parts little by
                  little while keeping them under tension.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once the tension relaxed, after a couple of days, we softened
                  the support and paint layer using the above-described method
                  and restretched the heavily deformed and buckled parts of the
                  painting again. Large waves were carefully modeled into plane
                  by hand. These steps were performed over the course of several
                  weeks. When the heaviest deformations were leveled, a
                  substructure was built under the painting to allow the use of
                  sandbags to press down on the reformed support. In the end we
                  were able to close the horizontal tear by using Trekkers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting was then turned over, and smaller deformations
                  were worked over from the back with heat and weighted down
                  with sandbags. Some tears in the lower half of the painting
                  could not be joined together without causing new deformations,
                  because the canvas was warped and could not be re-formed due
                  to its brittleness.

                <p>
                  The Stabiltex was laid out on a siliconized paper and Plexigum
                  PQ 611 40% in Shellsol D&nbsp;40 was applied with a spatula. After
                  the adhesive had dried, the fabric was cut into strips
                  individually for each tear and ironed on with a heated spatula
                  at approximately 50°C ([<strong>fig. 13.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/13-Brandt/fig-13-5)).

                <h3 id="lining" tabindex="-1">Lining</h3>
                <p>
                  A thin, bleached canvas by Nordmeyer &amp; Kortmann was used
                  as lining canvas. The adhesives used were Plextol D&nbsp;540 and
                  Dispersion K&nbsp;360 in a ratio of 7:3. The Plextol mixture was
                  sprayed onto the lining canvas with a compressed air gun at
                  3&nbsp;mbar and allowed to dry. The result was an adhesive fluff
                  that allows superficial bonding to the original canvas without
                  penetrating it. The adhesive has a very low peeling force,
                  which allows easy removal of the lining canvas. This procedure
                  corresponds to mist-lining ([[Seymour and Van Och 2005]]).
                  Using calculations from preliminary testing, one liter of
                  adhesive was needed to line the painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The prepared lining canvas was pushed from the right side
                  between the stretcher and the support and then ironed onto the
                  back at a temperature of approximately 45°C. In the curved
                  segment at the top, the lining canvas was fixed with staples
                  onto a strip of acid-free cardboard that became an
                  intermediate layer on the inside of the stretcher ([<strong>fig. 13.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/13-Brandt/fig-13-6)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining canvas had been cut to size so that it protruded
                  where the original stretching system was no longer in place.
                  The protruding canvas could then be folded over to the front
                  in order to border and stabilize the support at the edges and
                  to provide a new surface for stretching. Suede leather was put
                  under the nails. Jute threads were inserted into the remaining
                  tears and ironed onto the adhesive of the lining canvas.
                  Finally, the missing areas were filled in and retouched.

                <p>
                  In <em>The Last Judgment</em>’s final state, the depiction is
                  visible again, and further damage to the painting has been
                  prevented ([<strong>fig. 13.7</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/13-Brandt/fig-13-7)).
                  At the same time, the history of the painting and its
                  technological peculiarities remain visible as some
                  re-shapeable deformations were left. The tears were visually
                  pushed back using restrained retouching. Despite the extensive
                  intervention in the structure of the painting, it fits well
                  into the cycle without making the other six less damaged,
                  unrestored paintings look inferior.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining of a painting always represents a massive—often
                  irreversible—intervention. However, the example of
                  <em>The Last Judgement</em> shows that, in rare cases, a
                  lining can be the only way to save a painting from further
                  decay. In this case, lining did not mean abandoning the
                  original stretching system and pressing the support as flat as
                  a board. Even a more careful intervention with respect for the
                  much-cited <em>Alterswert</em> (age value) can achieve the
                  desired success.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It should not go unmentioned that the restoration has made it
                  possible to display <em>The Last Judgment</em> for the first
                  time since the 1980s. Before the restoration, we had been told
                  that it was a “restoration for storage,” as there was no room
                  in the small museum for a permanent presentation of the cycle.
                  However, the extensive restoration and the aesthetically
                  satisfying result led to the main painting (at least) now
                  being on display in the museum—which also means better storage
                  conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We revisited the painting in 2019 and found it in good
                  condition, with the lining still in place. The only drawback
                  we could observe so far is that the lining canvas does not
                  seem to adhere well to the Plexigum PQ&nbsp;611–coated Stabiltex.
                  As a result, some of the tears have opened slightly, and dirt
                  may fall in. So far, this does not seem to be destabilizing
                  the lining. We plan to revisit the painting on a regular basis
                  to see how the restoration stands up to time and climate.

                  supervisors, Dr. Catharina Blänsdorf and Cornelia Saffarian,
                  at TU München for technical advice and logistics. Last but not
                  least, we would like to express our gratitude to the Advisory
                  Committee of the Conserving Canvas Symposium for selecting our
                  paper and organizing the conference, and to the Getty
                  Foundation for their financial support.

                  The collections of Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum have a
                  long tradition, reaching back at least four centuries. Many
                  large-scale paintings originally were conceived to decorate
                  walls of the castles of the Habsburg family but have lost that
                  function over the centuries, so there are large holdings of
                  oversized paintings in storage. However, many large paintings
                  are still in situ as decorative pieces in offices or museums
                  housed in former imperial palaces and in other public spaces,
                  and a certain number of large-scale paintings are on display
                  in museum galleries. This paper explores various strategies
                  for preserving these holdings, from improving storage
                  conditions to in situ structural interventions to in-depth
                  treatments in the studio. As any treatment of large-scale
                  paintings is a big commitment, consuming space, time, and
                  manpower, much remains to be done.

                <p>
                  In any museum conservation studio, strategies and methods are
                  based on the collection’s condition and demands, so let us
                  start with a brief introduction to the character and history
                  of the paintings collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum
                  Vienna (KHM). In terms of numbers, only a small selection of
                  its holdings is on display in the galleries of the main museum
                  building at Burgring 5, but large parts of the collection are
                  on show at other locations: the Hofburg Palace, housing the
                  Imperial Treasury; the Imperial Armory and the Collection of
                  Historical Musical Instruments; and the Imperial Carriage
                  Museum, at Schönbrunn Palace. Ambras Castle near Innsbruck
                  houses an important collection of portraits. The KHM has also
                  sent paintings as long-term loans to satellite museums set up
                  by other public organizations—mainly former imperial palaces
                  such as Schönbrunn, Laxenburg, Eckartsau, and Schloss Hof.
                  Around eight hundred paintings are on loan to government
                  offices in historic buildings and Austrian embassies. Located
                  about 20 km south of Vienna, the KHM’s central storage
                  facility houses over three thousand paintings and around a
                  thousand frames.

                  Rolling, Folding, and Other Provisional
                  Interventions—Conservation Problems of Large Canvas Paintings
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Vienna’s first imperial gallery displaying large canvases was
                  established in 1656 at Stallburg Palace, which housed Leopold
                  Wilhelm’s collection after his return from Brussels. Continual
                  changes in selection and display means paintings were (and
                  still are) transported between the main gallery and the other
                  venues ([[Swoboda 2008|, 110–23]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Handling is key in the preservation of large canvas paintings.
                  Canvases are rolled onto tubes for transport. Such
                  manipulations are difficult, and improper handling or storage
                  techniques (kinking, folding) often cause damage and paint
                  losses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ideally, a rolled canvas should soon be restretched, but our
                  storage houses numerous rolled paintings: sixty-seven
                  paintings on nineteen rolls, including two ceiling paintings
                  by Nicola Maria Rossi,
                  <em>Pallas Abducts Juventus from the Arms of Venus</em> and
                  <em>Allegory of the Human Spirit</em> (1730, 500 x 500 cm, GG
                  7665 and 7666) from the Harrach garden palace, which was
                  bombed in World War II. They were rolled and acquired by the
                  KHM in 1968.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As early as the eighteenth century, inventories list paintings
                  without a strainer (or stretcher)<em>.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Even today, twenty-nine paintings are stored unstretched and
                  not rolled (flat), including a portrait of Philipp IV by a
                  Spanish artist (210 x 143 cm, GG 9269). Until the 1990s these
                  paintings had been stored for a long period piled on top of
                  each other in a storage facility formerly used to house the
                  KHM’s tapestry collection in Hofburg Palace. Lacking the
                  resources to stabilize and stretch these damaged paintings
                  properly, in the ’90s we mounted them clamped between sheets
                  of corrugated cardboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Canvas paintings with paper facings—partial or covering the
                  entire surface—testify to the lack of time and space for
                  proper conservation treatments. Bonifazio Veronese’s
                  <em>Raising of Lazarus</em> (early sixteenth century; 148 x
                  205.5 cm, GG 6679) has a typical mid-twentieth century facing
                  with newsprint paper. In the mid-1980s, Philippe de
                  Champaigne’s <em>Lamentation of Cain</em> (1656; 312 x 394 cm,
                  GG 371)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  was faced with sheets of Japanese paper. However, restoration
                  was delayed much longer than planned, and the facings—applied
                  with an aqueous medium—may have caused damage, such as
                  blanching of the varnishes. Often loose paint chips adhere
                  better to the paper facing than to the support, making the
                  paper’s removal difficult. Our efforts to remove facings and
                  properly consolidate flaking paint layers are ongoing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  This experience over time has led to a much more critical view
                  of facings.

                  As mentioned, our collection is housed at different locations,
                  but earlier decades saw attempts to centralize all holdings.
                  The KHM’s new central storage facility, built in 2011, proved
                  vital for storing large canvases ([[Götz and Oberthaler
                  2013]]). All paintings are now stored on racks and are
                  accessible without direct handling. The racks in the storage
                  room for large-scale canvas paintings measures 5 x 8 meters
                  and can accommodate even the largest canvases, including those
                  still rolled or stored between cardboard sheets ([<strong>fig. 14.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/14-Oberthaler/fig-14-1)).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  At present, the KHM storage holds 3,142 paintings and about
                  1,085 frames. Hopefully, soon all canvas paintings will be
                  accessible and mounted on stretchers.

                  A significant number of lined canvas paintings suffer from
                  infestation by <em>Stegobium paniceum</em> (biscuit beetle)<em>,</em>
                  which primarily affects canvases lined around 1900, when a
                  thick layer of glue paste with a high content of animal glue
                  was used. To avoid new infestations, all objects or paintings
                  are treated in the anoxic nitrogen chamber prior to storage.
                  Both conservators and our building department focus on
                  integrated pest management. We use traps to monitor insect
                  activity, some with lights to attract insects. Since 2011, we
                  have had one case of reinfestation in the central storage
                  building, which we countered with tiny parasitoid wasps,
                  <em>Lariophagus distinguendus,</em> which parasitize the
                  beetle’s larvae, ending the infestation ([[Querner,
                  Oberthaler, and Strolz 2019]]).

                  Titian’s *<em>Ecce Homo*</em>: An Eighteenth-Century
                  Lining—Partial Interventions Instead of Relining
                </h2>
                <p>
                  For centuries, lining was used to preserve canvas paintings.
                  Our earliest extant linings presumably date from the late
                  eighteenth century. Their typical loosely woven lining canvas
                  is fixed to the original canvas with glue-paste ironed on from
                  the reverse.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  A recently treated prominent example is Titian’s
                  <em>Ecce Homo</em> (1543; 242 x 361 cm, GG 73).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe the painting was placed face down on a table,
                  without the strainer, for lining. Then the lining canvas,
                  fixed to the (new) strainer and impregnated with glue paste,
                  was placed on top of the original canvas. The painting’s
                  original tacking edge was affixed with separate nails,
                  covering the earlier rows of tacks and the ironed lining. (The
                  multiple rows of nails are visible only when the painting is
                  removed from its stretcher and in X-ray images.) If paintings
                  with such linings are removed from the stretcher, the rougher
                  texture of the lining canvas is visible where it has not been
                  ironed, as it was covered by the strainer. The marked bevel of
                  the strainer bars allowed the edges beneath the stretcher to
                  dry better.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Normally these eighteenth-century linings are quite stable,
                  and the surface texture of the original paint layers is well
                  preserved, as on Titian’s <em>Ecce Homo;</em> there only the
                  tacking edges were torn, and the canvas had come loose from
                  the stretcher, suffering some deformations in the corners.
                  Since the damage mainly affected the edges of the lining
                  canvas, we decided to remove the stretcher and stabilize the
                  torn borders but not to remove the lining the painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Delaminated areas between the original and the lining canvas
                  were reglued. We used inserts of old or similar canvas to
                  restore the losses and the coherence of the lining ([<strong>fig. 14.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/14-Oberthaler/fig-14-2)).
                  Smaller holes from previous insect infestation were filled
                  with a mixture of canvas fibers and sturgeon glue.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  For the strip lining, needed to remount the painting on a
                  stretcher, we glued natural canvas—frayed and thinned to avoid
                  sharp edges—to the lining with an acrylic emulsion.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  The stretcher was structurally stable but much keyed out and
                  too small when assembled; we added strips of wood to align it
                  with the painting. Restretching was done the traditional way
                  (i.e., with small pieces of cardboard beneath the nails to
                  facilitate their removal, if necessary). Structural treatment
                  was followed by cleaning and removal of old overpaints,
                  procedures we hope to publish soon.

                  Caravaggio’s *<em>Rosary Madonna*</em>: Changed Locations and
                  Format Changes
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The nineteenth century favored using types of canvas with a
                  finer and denser texture for lining. One example of a painting
                  lined this way is Caravaggio’s <em>Rosary</em>
                  <em>Madonna,</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  which also exemplifies the frequent format changes imposed
                  over the years to adjust a painting’s size to a new location.
                  In this case, a “revised revision” occurred a century later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rubens and other prominent Antwerp artists purchased
                  Caravaggio’s <em>Rosary Madonna</em>, first documented in
                  Antwerp’s Dominican church around 1620. In 1781, the painting
                  was presented to Emperor Joseph II, and in 1786, it was
                  transported to Vienna, presumably rolled ([[Prohaska and
                  Swoboda 2010|, 71]]), during the Napoleonic Wars.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  It was probably relined before being installed at Belvedere
                  Palace in the early nineteenth century. We do not know why its
                  size was reduced by folding about 30 centimeters of the
                  original canvas over the upper strainer edge. This strip
                  remained unlined until 1913, when the format change was
                  reversed.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  To avoid risk and costs, large-scale paintings are rarely
                  moved. In 2019, when the painting was moved for the exhibition
                  <em>Caravaggio &amp; Bernini</em>, we took the opportunity to
                  thoroughly examine it.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  Unframing revealed damage to the canvas from the tacking edges
                  but also more information on format changes. The 1913
                  intervention concerned only the top edge, as indicated by the
                  different, more modern tacks used there. The
                  nineteenth-century lining canvas did not cover the entire
                  original canvas, as the strip folded over had remained
                  unlined.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                  In 1913, when the strip was reintegrated to the picture plane,
                  the upper stretcher bar was temporarily removed to access the
                  area for treatment. The border of the lining (the area of the
                  previous tacking edge) was removed. This probably helped
                  flatten deformations caused by the former tacking edge. The
                  previously unlined original canvas was partially lined, but
                  only to the edge of the previous lining, and a random strip of
                  original canvas again remained unlined. The side bars of the
                  stretcher were extended to compensate for the missing
                  centimeters in its height, and the old upper bar of stretcher
                  was reinserted ([<strong>fig. 14.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/14-Oberthaler/fig-14-3)).
                  Finally, the upper portion of the painting was restretched,
                  returning the entire composition to its original size.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2019, we found the edges of the older areas of lining,
                  untouched since the early nineteenth century, were frail, with
                  several detached/delaminated or torn pieces of canvas. The
                  paint layers of the previously folded lining were considerably
                  more cupped than those of the well-preserved main picture
                  surface. In addition, the area had suffered deformations in
                  the support. A small, unlined area was smothered in glue
                  remnants from the first lining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Removing the nails from the upper edge and the upper stretcher
                  bar revealed the top edge (again). The thick glue remnants
                  mentioned above could then be scraped away with a scalpel, and
                  deformations were flattened using local humidification and
                  weight. Unlined areas received small inserts of old canvas of
                  a weight and weave similar to the nineteenth-century lining
                  that were attached to the original canvas with methyl
                  cellulose. Finally, the upper edges were reattached to the
                  stretcher. Other detached canvas pieces along the edges were
                  reglued with a mixture of wheat-starch paste and sturgeon glue
                  and dried under pressure. Without much effort, the painting
                  with its two-hundred-year-old lining was restored to a
                  structurally safe condition.

                <p>
                  We do not know why the cleaning of Salvator Rosa’s
                  <em>Battle of the Romans</em> (1645; 229 x 345 cm, GG 1641)
                  was interrupted—perhaps it proved too difficult or too much
                  work, or priorities shifted, or its condition or quality did
                  not, after all, meet expectations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting was stored for more than fifty years until
                  research by Gudrun Swoboda, alongside ongoing attempts to
                  improve the condition of all stored paintings, suggested a
                  reevaluation. Its condition was compromised: the painted
                  surface comprised overpaints, overcleaned areas, and
                  structural problems including flaking paint layers that were
                  partially covered with paper facings, and fragile tacking
                  edges from earlier (now inactive) insect infestations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The thick glue layers of linings dating to around 1900 had
                  provided attractive breeding grounds for
                  <em>Stegobium paniceum</em>, which likes to lay its eggs in
                  the narrow, dark, sheltered space between stretcher and
                  canvas, where its larvae are hidden. These beetles had damaged
                  the edges of Rosa’s composition so badly that only some areas
                  remained attached to the stretcher. Removal of the stretcher
                  revealed the extent of the infestation: large areas beneath
                  the stretcher were eaten, and most of the lining canvas had
                  degraded to fibers and powder ([<strong>fig. 14.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/14-Oberthaler/fig-14-4)).
                  Lining in unaffected areas, however, remained firmly attached.
                  The original canvas, where visible, appeared quite
                  thinned—probably it had been scraped down prior to the lining,
                  to obtain a “clean” surface.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We decided to attempt a partial treatment rather than a
                  complete removal of the lining, removing only the eaten areas
                  of the old lining and replacing them with a new strip lining
                  in order to safely restretch the painting. Removing the entire
                  lining, with its strong adhesion and massive glue layer, would
                  have stressed the original canvas and paint layers and would
                  have required a new lining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We used a semisolid gel of agar to remove the lining glue
                  along the damaged edges, which peeled off with the old glue
                  embedded. Remnants of glue on the canvas were removed
                  mechanically with a scalpel. We chose acrylic emulsion Lascaux
                  498-HV as the adhesive. The fringes of the strip-lining were
                  later attached atop the old lining using wheat starch with
                  rabbit skin glue and pressure. Once cleaning and restoration
                  are completed, we hope to install the painting in the gallery.

                  Many paintings from the collection embellish government
                  offices, the most prominent of which is the Office of the
                  Austrian President in Hofburg Palace, which boasts two large
                  eighteenth-century canvases depicting a performance of Gluck’s
                  <em>Parnasso Confuso</em> at Schönbrunn on January 24, 1765,
                  in which four of Maria Theresia’s daughters participated.

                <p>
                  The two monumental paintings were installed after World War
                  II. Over the years, their canvas supports had lost tension and
                  they appeared almost like flapping draperies. We had to
                  organize our interventions carefully, as the Presidential
                  Chancery is closed for only six to eight weeks each summer. It
                  took us two summers, one for each painting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
                  We removed all the furniture and placed the canvas carefully
                  on the prepared floor. Removing the stretcher revealed that
                  the lining canvas was not infested by
                  <em>Stegobium paniceum,</em> although the lining was of the
                  type discussed above, but there was some delamination between
                  the original canvas and the lining canvas around the edges.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After cleaning the reverse with a brush and vacuum cleaner,
                  the delaminated parts of the lining and the original canvas
                  were reglued with a paste comprising wheat starch and rabbit
                  skin glue.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                  For strip-lining we used natural canvas, thinned on the inside
                  by removing threads (parallel to the tacking edge) and by
                  sanding the remaining threads to avoid sharp edges.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  The top-left part of one painting (GG 6826), showing the
                  interior of the opera house, was disfigured by an old, coarse
                  repair of a tear in the original and lining canvases.
                  Following a partial humidity treatment, we opened the
                  overlapping areas of the lining canvas. The threads around the
                  tear in the original canvas were then aligned and mended
                  ([<strong>fig. 14.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/14-Oberthaler/fig-14-5)).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>
                  Bridges of hemp threads impregnated with Beva were attached to
                  the original canvas in the torn area using a soldering needle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The tear in the lining canvas was closed with stitches sewn by
                  using a semicircular needle and nylon and polyester threads.
                  The bond between lining and original canvas was achieved by
                  injecting starch paste with a syringe and then adding weights
                  while it dried. For additional stability, noncorrosive steel
                  wires (0.3 and 0.38 mm) were attached at several points with
                  thick, adhesive acrylic emulsion (Lascaux 498&nbsp;HV). The
                  stretcher was numbered and then dismantled in our workshop,
                  where it was stabilized and structurally weak areas repaired.
                  Once the structural canvas treatment was completed, the
                  repaired stretcher elements were returned to Hofburg Palace to
                  be assembled, and the canvas was stretched and the painting
                  reinstalled.

                  Twentieth-Century Lining Procedures
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Lining methods changed little over the centuries—restorers
                  were trained by their predecessors and trained their own
                  successors. There was long a strict division of labor between
                  structural and “artistic” work. Though that is still enforced
                  in some studios, the KHM abandoned it in the early 1980s.
                  So-called artistic restoration work included cleaning,
                  retouching, and varnishing and was the preserve of
                  painter-restorers until 1934, when the conservation program
                  was established at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, when
                  trained restorers started to take over.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                  Structural treatments (lining, cradling, filling) were
                  considered less important and presumably were carried out by
                  technicians, who had mostly trained as cabinetmakers and were
                  probably supervised by restorers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Irons were replaced by a veneer press in the late 1930s. The
                  aim was to minimize the physical impact during lining
                  procedures—humidity, heat, and pressure—by omitting heat. Once
                  cleaned and filled, the paintings were pressed in the veneer
                  press between wooden boards and several layers of felt and
                  molino, a plain cotton cloth. Due to the use of an aqueous
                  lining adhesive, the painting needed to be pressed before the
                  unstretched canvas reacted to humidity—timing was of the
                  essence. For these linings, however, the paintings were
                  pressed repeatedly—apparently, the period favored a flatter
                  surface texture than we do today.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is very little documentation of such lining procedures.
                  A rare exception is the photographic documentation of the
                  lining of Cagnacci’s <em>Suicide of Cleopatra</em> (1661–62;
                  153 x 169 cm, GG 260) carried out by Hubert Dietrich and
                  Gerald Kaspar in 1985. The latter stressed the importance of
                  documenting the structural treatment procedures, rather than
                  only the state before cleaning and after restoration, as was
                  the practice before. The existence of photographic evidence
                  from treatment procedures is largely owed to Kaspar.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lining was routine, and something of a go-to conservation
                  treatment for damaged canvas paintings. The storage facility
                  houses many cleaned, lined, and filled—but not
                  restored—paintings, such as Libalt’s
                  <em>Garland of Fruits and Carpet</em> (1664; 212 x 195 cm, GG
                  2933) and Pietro de Pomis’s
                  <em>Archduke Maximilian Ernst on his Deathbed</em> (1616;
                  118.5 x 227.5 cm, GG 9275).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Until the 1990s, starch-paste lining remained standard in the
                  KHM Vienna, which is why we have almost no paintings with wax
                  linings or synthetic materials.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>
                  Since then, lining has been almost completely abandoned: from
                  1980 to 2000, fifty-two paintings were lined; from 2000 to
                  2020, only four paintings were lined. Conservators in a museum
                  generally prefer a noninvasive approach. Whereas artworks in
                  churches and private homes are often at the mercy of their
                  surroundings, the controlled environmental conditions of
                  museums protect works of art and slows their deterioration. If
                  a conservator can monitor the conditions of a critical
                  painting on a regular basis, treatments can frequently be
                  postponed. This, however, requires a trained conservation
                  staff and—apart from sufficient documentation—a good
                  institutional memory. But a preference for fewer and less
                  invasive treatments also means the skills to perform in-depth
                  structural interventions are gradually lost.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  Although lining was standard practice for centuries, quite a
                  few canvas paintings remained unlined. One such is Gottfried
                  Libalt’s
                  <em>Still Life with a Bust of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm</em>
                  (1660; 253 x 119 cm, GG 7795) ([<strong>fig. 14.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/14-Oberthaler/fig-14-6)).
                  Over the years, the painting suffered a lot of structural
                  damage: the tears in the original canvas measure 5 meters in
                  total. In storage for centuries, its width was reduced by
                  almost half when large parts of the composition were folded
                  back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A new installation at the Kunstkammer gave it a new lease on
                  life; it is paired with the bust that is depicted in the
                  painting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>
                  Libalt’s still life must have been commissioned by Leopold
                  Wilhelm himself. It is listed in his 1659 inventory, though it
                  is dated a year later on the painting itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlined seventeenth-century paintings are rare and the still
                  life’s surface texture, with its illusionistic, almost
                  3D-rendering of the carpet, motivated us to find a way to
                  stabilize the picture without lining it. Pressed for time, we
                  collaborated with a specialized freelance team, who performed
                  the treatment in time by organizing several round-the-clock
                  shifts of tear-menders.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>
                  (For details of the treatment, see [[Walde, Wernitznig, and
                  Oberthaler 2014]].)
                </p>
                <p>
                  To begin, we removed the painting from the strainer and
                  examined the various interventions and format changes (see
                  [<strong>fig. 14.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/14-Oberthaler/fig-14-6)).
                  In addition to the painting’s reduced width mentioned above,
                  its height had been extended by the addition of two strips of
                  canvas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting is listed in Leopold Wilhelm’s inventory, which
                  gave us a contemporary record of its original size, although
                  this includes the frame.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>
                  The canvas scalloping and other key features, such as the
                  selvages within the original seam (presumably once in the
                  center), as well as on the left edge, and the black paint
                  covering the unpainted canvas at the left edge, provided
                  evidence of its original format. Our research also suggested
                  that the top extensions were later additions. This and the
                  size recorded in the inventory allowed a conclusive
                  reconstruction of the original, and we decided to reestablish
                  this format.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To flatten the deformations, the canvas was treated with
                  indirect humidity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>
                  The most labor-intensive interventions were thread-to-thread
                  tear-mending and thread-by-thread inserting (and weaving) new
                  threads to reconstruct the losses of original canvas ([<strong>fig. 14.7</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/14-Oberthaler/fig-14-7)).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>
                  The open areas in the original seam were connected with
                  stitches or bridges from the reverse.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>
                  The strip-lining with a new natural Belgian canvas, prepared
                  by fringing and coated with a layer of self-made Beva film,
                  was then sealed to the original canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To reconstruct the original format, we needed to “lose” the
                  top, nonoriginal strip of canvas. We decided not to remove
                  these nonoriginal (though old) additions but to flip them. To
                  protect both the old canvas and brittle paint layers, a
                  rounded wooden (slightly larger) profile was added to the top
                  edge of the stretcher. The upper edge of the support was fixed
                  to the stretcher on the reverse with adhesive at the
                  strip-lining. The canvas and paint layers on the reverse are
                  protected with acid-free corrugated cardboard. The painting
                  was then framed and glazed for display, with its unlined but
                  fragmentary character preserved.

                <p>
                  Extensive treatments of large paintings depend on many
                  preconditions, which sometimes are difficult to achieve even
                  in established institutions. These preconditions are free
                  studio space for an extended period of time and the long-term
                  collaboration of trained professionals—conservators, curators,
                  scientists, technicians, directors—making treatment decisions
                  a big commitment. Unfortunately, such commitment is
                  increasingly difficult to attain in times marked by the quick
                  turnover of paintings forced on conservation studios by
                  exhibition schedules and reduced museum staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the focus increasingly on preventive conservation and
                  technical research (and the time needed for administration),
                  museum conservators are in danger of losing their structural
                  intervention skills. In contrast, freelance conservators need
                  to complete conservation treatments, but they may not always
                  be able to carry out the necessary research, resulting in
                  divergent skill sets between restorers working in museums and
                  freelancers. This fact makes it imperative that museum staff
                  and freelancers join forces and institute a regular exchange
                  of ideas. Collaboration between professionals with a wide
                  range of skills and strong institutional support for
                  conservation are key to preserving artworks for future
                  generations.

                        painting was evacuated on a “big drum” (i.e., cylinder)
                        together with seven other Italian and Netherlandish

                  This paper discusses the ways that different fabrics, weaving,
                  and structure of a canvas influence its mechanical and
                  hydromechanical behavior. It goes on to consider how this
                  already complex composite is further modified by subsequent
                  layers, whether in a new or degraded state. In particular, it
                  highlights the conditions in which the weave structure—and
                  behavior related to that structure—still influence the overall
                  response of a painting on canvas. The paper also reviews
                  research relevant to conserving canvas in the fields of
                  polymer mechanics, fiber-reinforced composites, and smart
                  materials, looking at research related to both the modeling of
                  canvas and composite properties and at experimental studies.
                  Often, there appears to be a big gap between research carried
                  out in science, engineering, and conservation science and the
                  research that conservators feel will help them solve practical
                  problems and devise effective treatments. This paper suggests
                  directions for future research—pure and applied—that may aid
                  in the structural conservation of painting on canvas.

                  The woven structure of canvas, although modified by the
                  subsequent layers of the painting, still influences the
                  mechanical and hydromechanical behavior of this complex
                  composite. To highlight the issues of complexity, this paper
                  brings together and reevaluates collaborative research
                  conducted over twenty-five years that addresses these issues
                  in the context of the structural conservation of canvas
                  paintings. It discusses the methodologies of research related
                  to experimental work, practical conservation implementation,
                  and the modeling of canvas and its composite properties. The
                  key findings, with examples, and the methods used to obtain
                  useful data and practical insights are given, along with the

                  In the context of artists canvas and lining fabric, most
                  fabrics are made from natural materials. For painted cloth,
                  silk, calico, cotton, and linen have been the most common
                  fabrics both geographically and historically. However, other
                  natural materials—for instance, bark cloth ([[Lennard, Tamura,
                  and Nesbitt 2017]])—are part of rich traditions of painting,
                  and we are only beginning to understand their behavior as
                  painting supports ([[Smith, Holmes-Smith, and Lennard 2019]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The choice of canvas by artists is often made for pragmatic
                  reasons, including local production, availability, expense,
                  and size. Important features of these natural materials are
                  their flexibility, texture, and absorbency (see “Moisture
                  Response” below), which make them suitable for the application
                  of paint. For fabric supports, some of these features are a
                  product of the preparation, but most originate from the fiber
                  type, yarn structure, and weave structure (flexibility and
                  texture). It is reasonable to suggest that in all but the most
                  prestigious commissions the artist had little control, or even
                  interest, in these factors, but instead innately, or through
                  treatises and word of mouth, thought of a canvas as either
                  suitable or not suitable for the execution of a particular
                  painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The discussion below focuses on cotton and linen but
                  acknowledges the use of silk, both in traditional non-Western
                  and Western art and in contemporary contexts. In a few cases,
                  it has been possible to trace the evidence of artists’ choice
                  through letters, colormen archives, and anecdotes ([[Johnson
                  et al. 2010]]), but rarely has the production of the canvas
                  been under their control. Historically cloth was a commodity
                  for household furnishings, military and naval outfitting, and
                  ecclesiastical and court events. It is with the advent of
                  industrial weaving that different weights of cloth became more
                  accessible through artists suppliers, and the small batch
                  production of artists’ canvas started to occur. However, there
                  is mounting evidence through technical examination and
                  conservation records that, prior to industrialization, artists
                  had access to different types and weaves, and in some cases
                  clearly choose some over others ([[Heydenreich et al. 2008]];
                  [[Seccarone 2012]]). Sources, including the National Portrait
                  Gallery’s list of British artists suppliers (1650–1950),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  individual websites, and publications that include research
                  into the trade in artists’ materials ([[Kirby, Nash, and
                  Cannon 2010]]) provide invaluable information from which to
                  build up a better understanding of the context in which
                  artists chose their materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Contemporary artists make both conscious and pragmatic choices
                  to use best-quality artists canvas (usually fine plain-weave
                  linen or cheaper cotton duck, which is also available in wider
                  widths), sacking (jute, usually plain weave), bank money bags
                  (cotton and linen, plain or twill weave), and mattress ticking
                  (an old favorite, usually linen with a herringbone twill
                  weave), as well as older, traditional materials used in a
                  contemporary context, such as bark cloth ([[Schneider 2021]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artists use canvas in a variety of ways: unstretched, sewn,
                  pierced, or formed into three dimensions. Canvas is also woven
                  from polyester specifically for art and conservation. This is
                  manufactured/supplied by companies such as Federix in the
                  United States, Haywards in the United Kingdom, and Lascaux in
                  Germany.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  In the performing arts there is more painting on plastic
                  gauzes and projection cloths made from woven and nonwoven
                  synthetics, including polyester, nylon, and Kevlar. The range
                  of fabrics used and available is best appreciated by visiting
                  the website of J.&nbsp;D. McDougall, a company that has supplied
                  fabrics for over a hundred years.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h3 id="types-of-weave" tabindex="-1">Types of Weave</h3>
                <p>
                  A woven fabric made from a single type of fiber (e.g., flax)
                  is a composite influenced by the way it is grown or
                  synthesized and then processed into yarn ready for weaving.
                  The various levels of hierarchy in the structure influence, in
                  differing degrees, the overall fabric behavior. The yarn type,
                  diameter, flatness, and stiffness affect flexibility and
                  moisture response. The density of fiber yarns and type of
                  weave influence yarn mobility, stiffness, drape, fracture
                  toughness, and permeability ([[Young and Jardine 2012]]). The
                  fabric permeability affects moisture response, consolidation,
                  impregnation, and lining treatments ([[Young and Ackroyd
                  2001]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, surface or impregnating coatings (e.g., size,
                  paint, and consolidants) affect tensile, shear, bending
                  properties, yarn mobility, and fracture toughness. For
                  traditional Western paintings, we have a good experimental and
                  empirical understanding of the complex composite of woven
                  fabric and coatings. Research into the behavior of
                  double-sided painted cloth such as trade union banners
                  ([<strong>fig. 15.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/15-Young/fig-15-1))
                  ([[Smith,
                  <a href="#http-eprints-gla-ac-uk-view-author-17095-html" target="_blank">Thompson,</a>
                  and

                  2016]]) or the behavior of twill and more complex weaves,
                  however, is in its infancy (see “Reconstructing Weaves”
                  below). Certainly, more research is required to determine the
                  dominant contributing factors in the mechanical and
                  hydromechanical behavior of canvas when new materials and
                  techniques are used in contemporary art or used in mixed media
                  and with new synthetic artists materials such as water-mixable
                  oil paint, inks, or acrylic primed spun polyester canvas (see
                  “Reconstructions for the Contemporary Use of Canvas” below).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Prediction of painted canvas properties from experimental
                  mechanical and chemical data is the first step. Testing on
                  single-constituent yarns, free films, single layers, and/or
                  simple multilayers provides invaluable information that
                  relates to both the present and past and to changes in
                  properties caused by natural aging and conservation
                  treatments. However, these are relatively simple interactions
                  and therefore only partially representative. Conservation
                  treatments themselves are a valuable source of “live”
                  empirical data of the real complex interactions, but they are
                  not easily reproducible. Nevertheless, many years of
                  experience adds up to a powerful knowledge base of possible
                  outcomes.

                  Analytical or computational studies for fabric/canvas behavior
                  have developed models that can account for one level of
                  hierarchy—fiber level, yarn level, weave pattern level—or with
                  continuous, homogenous layers with simplified superposition of
                  layers. Ideally however, to model fabric permeability, for
                  example, it is necessary to consider both microporosity (fiber
                  spacing) and macroporosity (yarn spacing) ([[Zeng et al.
                  2014]]). Models based on geomechanical structures (soil and
                  rock) have been suggested as a useful approach to studying
                  consolidation ([[Michalski 2008]]). Certainly, many of the
                  phenomena—such as crack networks, diffusion, and complex
                  interacting layers—are common to both fields. Therefore,
                  applying such models would be beneficial to canvas
                  conservation studies.

                <p>
                  Similarly, to predict biaxial behavior of woven fabric, the
                  model of the weave needs to consider friction at the yarn
                  crossover. These more complex multilevel models are yet to be
                  fully developed ([[Aliabadi 2015]]). Past attempts to model
                  the complex structure of canvas paintings and fabrics have
                  used a finite element analysis (FEA) approach ([[Guanzhi et
                  al. 2017]]; [[Mecklenburg, McCormick-Goodhart, and Tumosa
                  1994]]). By using analytical models developed for tensioned
                  fabric structures, the problems normally encountered with
                  accurately modeling complex curved surfaces are mitigated.
                  Bicubic-spline models developed originally for architectural
                  applications ([[Brew and Lewis 2007]]) are the most
                  representative way to model a woven stretched canvas on a
                  stretcher ([[Young 2013]]; see “Strain Distribution” below).
                  However, the interaction of the uppermost layers can be
                  successfully modelled with FEA, taking into account their
                  viscoelastic properties ([[Tantideeravit et al. 2013]]).

                  In what ways is it possible to complement the existing
                  research? One approach is epidemiological studies of
                  collections and promotion of documentation protocols that
                  include canvas weave pattern and count, fiber type, and
                  duty/colorman stamps. This information not only helps in the
                  identification of the date and source of the canvas but is
                  invaluable for understanding the artist’s intent and the
                  provenance of artists’ materials ([[Johnson et al. 2010]];
                  [[Murillo-Fuentes and Alba 2018]]). It is also important for
                  conservation, as the weave structure still influences the
                  overall response of a painting, whatever its age. Combined
                  with consistent materials characterization, such information
                  may allow further insights to be gained into the mechanical
                  and hydromechanical behavior of real paintings.

                  While it is not always possible to be historically accurate at
                  every level of the canvas structure, weave, painting, and
                  lining reconstructions allow for repeatability and for endless
                  combinations to be experimentally tested and trends in
                  behavior to be established ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]; also
                  see “Moisture Response of linings” and “Reconstructing Weaves”
                  below). Lined paintings, as well as modern and contemporary
                  use of “canvas”—where if a material exists, an artist will use
                  it, and unconventionally—requires an understanding of
                  geometry, construction, and potentially the properties of many
                  different materials. Reconstructions play a crucial role in
                  understanding these elements.

                  Strain Distribution
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Several factors make the strain distribution within canvas
                  complex: it is a woven rather than a continuous, homogenous
                  layer; the strain response of the yarns is usually different
                  in the weft and warp; and factors including friction, density,
                  and weave pattern influence the strain distribution.
                  Additionally, on a strainer or stretcher, the attachments and
                  the stretcher construction (corners) induce uneven loading.
                  While the stress distribution that this loading creates cannot
                  be directly measured, the strain distribution can be measured
                  by techniques including Electronic Speckle Pattern
                  Interferometry (ESPI), digital image correlation (DIC), and
                  photogrammetry. ESPI can be used to obtain accurate
                  quantitative measurements of strain distributions of primed
                  canvas on a stretcher that replicate a real painting
                  configuration. Biaxial tensile properties of a painting and
                  its constituents can be obtained by mechanical testing. By
                  combining biaxial tensile testing with two-dimensional strain
                  mapping, however, it is possible to gain an understanding of
                  the composite behavior of a stretched canvas and the forces to
                  which it is subjected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The biaxial restraint of the canvas alters the strain
                  distribution around the tacks or staples, becoming
                  progressively more complex toward the corners. At the macro
                  level, the strain patterns induced by the attachments are
                  similar, with closer spacing resulting in more even strain
                  distribution. If the attachments pass through preprimed canvas
                  there is reduced local cusping, because of the greater
                  resistance of uncracked primed canvas to distortion in the
                  bias direction of the canvas. The restraint imposed by tight
                  corner folds reduces the high load that would be imposed on
                  the attachments near the corners if a loosely folded corner
                  was keyed out. Nevertheless, shrinkage of the canvas or keying
                  out will lead to significant strain concentrations in these
                  areas. The strain irregularities become significantly less if
                  the canvas is attached on the rear face of the stretcher
                  rather than the side. Staples are effective attachments until
                  the canvas between the legs begins to slip; then tears may
                  occur because the staple leg creates very high strain
                  concentrations. Tacks appear to be as effective in restraining
                  the canvas and less likely to cause tears ([[Young and&nbsp;Hibberd
                  2000]]).

                  Bicubic spline modelling (validated by ESPI) was the first
                  computational model of a painting to incorporate the
                  stretcher, staples, corner folds, and frictional forces. The
                  inclusion in the model of the measured coefficient of friction
                  of 0.63 for a pine stretcher bar showed that areas of high
                  strain move outward toward the edges of the stretcher.

                  compare the measured strain obtained using ESPI with the
                  modeled strain for the same canvas properties and loading
                  conditions. The close correlation of the two distributions in
                  terms of overall magnitude and specific features is very good.
                  This gives a high level of confidence in using a bicubic
                  spline model to predict modes of failure and improve upon the
                  present methods of tensioning canvas by simulating the strains
                  induced in canvas under different conditions ([[Brew, Lewis,
                  and Young 2016]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  ESPI has also been a useful tool for evaluating structural
                  conservation treatments, for instance, tear mending. A
                  painting will have high strains near the tear and strain
                  concentrations at the ends of the tear, which are sites for
                  potential propagation of the tear. If a tear is close to a
                  corner or a tack/staple, this situation will be exacerbated
                  because of the nonuniform loading. Implicit in restoring the
                  mechanical integrity of a painting is the requirement to
                  reestablish a uniform strain field across the painting—or at
                  least one whose average strain is commensurate ([[Young
                  2003]]). This can be seen for the Heiber (thread-by-thread)
                  tear mend strain map shown in
                  <strong>[fig.
                    15.4](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/15-Young/fig-15-4)</strong>
                  for an acrylic primed canvas under 50&nbsp;N biaxial tension.
                  Redistribution, reduction, or eradication of strain
                  concentrations (one color in the map) implies a uniform strain
                  field. Both the patch ([<strong>fig. 15.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/15-Young/fig-15-5))
                  and the Heiber mend demonstrate that this can be achieved to
                  some degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In both cases residual strain concentrations are present. For
                  the Heiber—or any equivalent tear mend—reducing these
                  concentrations below these levels is very hard to achieve by
                  visual inspection alone. A “perfect” mend would eliminate
                  strain concentrations around the original fracture site,
                  preventing potential propagation of the tear. Similarly, any
                  patch should have high fracture toughness and minimal
                  stiffness. The patch strain map (see [<strong>fig. 15.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/15-Young/fig-15-5))
                  shows that the level of strain concentrations has been
                  reduced, but small discontinuities in strain occur at the
                  edges of the patch.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Patches, which impart additional flexural stiffness with the
                  aim of keeping the tear flat, are likely to result in an area
                  of lower strain across the patch, but also larger
                  discontinuities. The adhesive and type of adhesive interface
                  will be the major factors in determining whether a tear mend
                  is strong enough to withstand “normal” stress distributions
                  within the canvas. The onset of failure will be evident as an
                  increase in strain concentrations while loading.

                  Apart from assessing which techniques are mechanically most
                  successful, future research needs to look at how the materials
                  used in the subsequent layers of fill and retouching alter the
                  balance of forces in and around the tear. This includes
                  looking at interfacial tensions built up by the drying of
                  fills and coatings ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]), as well as
                  the ability of the filled mend to withstand fatigue caused by
                  cycling of temperature and relative humidity ([[Young 2013]]).

                  Strip-lining is another structural treatment perceived as
                  minimally invasive that aims to reinstate, as far as possible,
                  the structural integrity of the painting. Evaluation of the
                  various configurations and methods to prevent a sharp change
                  in stiffness at the edge of a strip in the picture plane have
                  been evaluated by ESPI. For example, strip-lining with Beva
                  371 and polyester sailcloth (00169, manufactured solely to
                  order by Richard Hayward &amp; Co., UK)—with pinked edges to
                  prevent a hard transition—actually results in strain
                  concentrations within the picture plane at the point of the
                  pinked triangle of polyester ([[Brew, Lewis, and Young
                  2016]]). As expected, under the same loading conditions a
                  feathered edge transition results in lower strain
                  concentrations. However, if too much adhesive is used, the
                  stiffness of the adhesive (even Beva 371) dominates, and a
                  strain concentration along the edge of the feathering occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ESPI is a very sensitive technique and does not always work
                  well for real paintings, especially those with glossy
                  varnishes or that are in situ where exterior vibrations occur.
                  For the application of strip-linings and other structural
                  conservation treatments, DIC with a relatively inexpensive,
                  fast-frame rate, high-resolution camera can produce good
                  results. Such systems are standard in engineering and offer a
                  complementary technique for nondestructive evaluation of
                  structural conservation treatments.

                <p>
                  Most of the data in the literature on moisture response
                  relates to uniaxial testing. The results, however, can be
                  misleading, as uniaxially the canvas is unconstrained in one
                  direction, and this is not representative of the stresses that
                  build up under biaxial constraint on a stretcher. Nonetheless,
                  careful experimental design and interpretation can mitigate
                  this difference. One of the most valuable resources for
                  measuring moisture response has come from deaccessioned
                  paintings and from nineteenth-century primed loose-linings.
                  [<strong>Fig. 15.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/15-Young/fig-15-6)
                  shows the typical load response in the weft and warp direction
                  for a primed loose-lining produced by Roberson colormen
                  ([[Carlyle,
                  <a href="#http-eprints-gla-ac-uk-view-author-37894-html" target="_blank">Young,</a>
                  and&nbsp;Jardine 2008]]). The tension in the two directions drops
                  until an inversion occurs at 70% RH, where the tension starts
                  to rise as relative humidity increases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This pattern occurs for many oil-primed canvases
                  (loose-linings), as was demonstrated by Hedley under uniaxial
                  tension ([[Hedley 1998]]). The initial drop in tension is
                  attributed to the size layer becoming softer as it absorbs
                  moisture, until it reaches a gelatinous state. Simultaneously,
                  the fibers in the canvas are absorbing moisture. At some
                  point, the swollen fibers cause the canvas to contract, and
                  because it is tacked in place the tension rises. Typically,
                  the tension in the weft direction increases significantly more
                  than the warp because it has less crimp. The major influences
                  on where this inversion occurs are weave density and the glue

                <p>
                  A database of moisture response for archival canvas,
                  reconstructions, and new types of canvas is useful in deciding
                  on a moisture treatment (how long and at how much moisture),
                  especially when the complexity of two canvases is involved, as
                  is the case with lined paintings. As a first approximation,
                  one can think of the problem as a superposition of two
                  canvases, and hence two moisture responses that induce
                  expansion and contraction, leading to stresses within the
                  canvases and induced stress distributions in all the layers.
                  This can be modeled with appropriate boundary conditions using
                  FEA and/or analytical models—if the properties of each layer
                  are known. However, there is often added complexity because
                  the lining adhesive (especially traditional glue-paste and
                  wax) has impregnated the original canvas, cracks, and
                  interfaces of the painting. Nevertheless, it is possible to
                  see trends in behavior when there is sufficient archival
                  material to characterize degradation and mechanical properties
                  ([[Young and Ackroyd 2001]]).

                  Moisture Response of Modern Materials
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The use of synthetic/modern materials in painted textiles can
                  be traced to the patents for textile coatings of the
                  nineteenth century ([[Young 2012]]). Research into their
                  properties began to have a direct influence of practice with
                  the work of Hedley and Hackney in the 1980s ([[Hackney
                  2020]]). Artists’ use of new materials, plus the conservator’s
                  desire to find a suitable lining canvas, means we need to
                  continue to characterize a wide selection of natural and
                  synthetic fabrics. It is insufficient to characterize only the
                  type of canvas (linen or polyester), because even for
                  synthetic fabrics the yarn processing, fabric weave density
                  and coatings (for example, fire retardants) influence moisture
                  response ([[Young and Jardine 2012]]). More disconcerting for
                  those choosing materials for treatments is the generic naming
                  of canvases; for example, “12 oz Belgian linen,” is a name,
                  not a description—it does not even mean it comes from Belgium.
                  This is confusing and misleading if one assumes certain
                  properties are dependent on the material’s source country.
                  Similarly, cotton duck data produced over twenty years ago
                  ([[Young 1996]]) will generally be valid today, but changes to
                  the source—and therefore the twist of the yarn, sizing,
                  tension during weaving, and subsequent regulatory coatings and
                  processes—can change the hydromechanical response.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course, this has always been the case. For instance, in the
                  eighteenth century, weavers in the east of Scotland branded
                  their linen fabrics “Osnaburg” (or Osnabrigg) an imitation of
                  Osnaburgh (also known as Osnabrück) ([[Young 2012]]).
                  Similarly, Lascaux P360 polyester (a linen look-alike) has
                  changed properties since it was introduced ([[Young and
                  Jardine 2012]]). Ideally one should characterize (or at least
                  empirically test) each new batch if one cannot guarantee its
                  response.

                <p>
                  Reconstructions of painted textiles in general—starting at the
                  yarn level and proceeding through weaving, stretching,
                  preparation layers, and subsequent artists
                  materials/techniques relevant to the work—are invaluable for
                  understanding how the manufacturing process, subsequent
                  preparations, and materials influence the aesthetic,
                  kinesthetic, and physiochemical behavior of the painting.
                  Fraught with uncertainty as to how authentic or historically
                  accurate they may be, reconstructions still allow one to
                  explore which properties have the biggest influence on
                  behavior through trying different variations and through
                  repeated testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reconstruction of canvas weaves is a relatively new approach.
                  It has come about in part from a greater awareness of and
                  interest in the weave’s significance in the provenance,
                  interpretation, and conservation of a painting. For example,
                  during the conservation treatment at the Cleveland Museum of
                  Art of <em>The Crucifixion of Saint Andrew</em> (1606–7) by
                  Caravaggio, it was possible to retrieve some information about
                  the original canvas from the x-radiograph, even though it had
                  been lined with a plain-weave canvas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  This painting may have been cut down, which would mean less
                  cusping would be visible. Inferences drawn from the cusping
                  had been extrapolated from simple plain-weave canvases, rather
                  than the complex weave of Caravaggio’s original canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the clarity of the original weave was hard to discern, a
                  trained eye (in this case, Dr. Dan Coughlan, curator and
                  master weaver at Paisley Museum, Scotland) identified the
                  weave as a huckaback, which is a plain weave with a floating
                  warp. Hence, he was able to set up the weaving pattern for a
                  traditional four-frame hand loom. Linen and jute yarn samples
                  were sourced from Jos Vanneste, a Belgian linen company. The
                  closest match to a yarn fragment from the painting was a linen
                  yarn, which was then woven into a canvas by a local Scottish
                  weaver. Empirical testing found that the canvas was more
                  stable on the bias than an equivalent plain weave without a
                  floating warp, and it developed less cusping when tacked onto
                  a stretcher.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The canvas was also prepared with a traditional double ground
                  layer, and, interestingly, drying cracks within these layers
                  were of a very similar size and pattern ([[Brunton 2018]]). A
                  more systematic and controlled set of tests are now being
                  performed on these samples using the biaxial tensile tester in
                  the Conservation Research Laboratory at the Hunterian, Glasgow
                  University. Such reconstructions are useful not only for
                  understanding the complexity of canvas but also for possible
                  use as fabrics for structural treatments. Having control over
                  the weaving process allows for a bespoke pattern (see
                  [Loermans’s
                  poster](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/15-Young/paper-47)
                  in these proceedings) and, combined with testing, the ability
                  to tune its properties.

                  The value of reconstructions for conservation/preventive
                  issues related to contemporary works as well as older works
                  cannot be underestimated. Either by working directly with the
                  artists, gallery, artist’s studio, fabricators, or documented
                  interviews, much can be gleaned, if not always volunteered,
                  that enable the use of the same materials and technique in the
                  reconstruction. This approach has been used in cleaning
                  ([[Barker and Ormsby 2015]]; [[Krueger 2017]]; [[Diamond et.
                  al. 2019]]), very effectively for tear mending ([[Piotrowska
                  and Amann 2009]]), and assessment of structural stability and
                  preventive treatments ([[Griffin, Young, and&nbsp;Hale 2014]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  One is example is a series of for acrylic preprimed linen and
                  polyester canvases on which acrylic paint and screen print ink
                  had been applied either directly or through a screen. These
                  works were unstretched on arrival for a display of the
                  artist’s work at a gallery in London. Several features were
                  considered undesirable: a general buckling of the canvas with
                  sharp cupping in certain areas, cracking in the upper paint
                  layers, and some buckling remaining in the works, once
                  stretched, with an overall lack of tension. By matching the
                  canvases as closely as possible and using the inks used by the
                  artist, it was possible to conduct a series of tests on the
                  biaxial tensile tester to recreate the phenomenon and to
                  understand its cause.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  This allowed recommendation of an appropriate treatment and
                  possible ways to mitigate the effects in future. It was found
                  that the liquid phase of inks caused local shrinkage of linen.
                  In the synthetic canvases, the liquid phase interacted with
                  the acrylic priming, softening it, unlocking the woven
                  polyester yarns, and allowing distortions to occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Possibly more challenging to the conservators of the future is
                  the embedding of materials within canvas ([[Nahum, McGuirk,
                  and Watson 2019]]) and haptics ([[Bianchi 2016]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  The testing of contemporary materials that an artist might use
                  as a “canvas” or in a sculpture/installation or that might be
                  a suitable alternative to traditional lining materials should
                  be an ongoing, proactive area of research within conservation.
                  While attempts have been made to work with manufacturers to
                  produce materials to our specifications, commercial production
                  of bespoke lining fabric is not viable. A proactive approach
                  is required to understand textiles manufactured for other
                  industries and to specify/design fabrics, as well as an
                  investment in our profession if we are to drive research and
                  production.

                <p>
                  The largest drivers of the development of new materials comes
                  from the aerospace, military, and apparel industries. The fact
                  that woven fabrics are part of contemporary composite
                  engineering materials attests to their success in increasing
                  the fracture toughness of structures. Fracture toughness
                  prevents cracks (tears) from propagating: in degraded canvas,
                  it is the brittleness of the yarns due to chain scission and
                  increased crystallinity of the cellulose (for flax and linen)
                  that substantially reduces the fracture toughness. Cotton duck
                  has a much lower fracture toughness even when new because of
                  its short staple length. Interestingly, natural materials,
                  including linen, are still part of active research into
                  improving the service life of structural composites, as they
                  have properties yet to be fully replicated by other methods
                  ([[Pandian and Jailani 2019]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nonwoven fabrics have been used both by artists and
                  conservators, typically as part of collage pieces or, in
                  conservation applications, as interleaves in linings. Such
                  fabrics can be made to be homogenous and heterogeneous, so it
                  would seem their relative lack of use is due to the lack of
                  texture, drape (ability to bend and form shapes, e.g., around
                  a stretcher bar corner) and “responsiveness” when painting.
                  However, the low absorbency of many synthetic materials may be
                  considered a good property for linings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  State-of-the-art fabric structures use surface modifications
                  to give the desired properties, such as hydrophobicity using
                  vapor deposition on fabric ([[Xu et al. 2019]]). Filled yarns
                  have been developed to increase stiffness and fracture
                  toughness ([[Gilchrist, Svensson, and Shishoo 1998]]).
                  Triaxial weaves, which have two sets of warps at 60 degrees to
                  the weft, give increased stability and stiffness on the bias
                  and better fracture toughness ([[Wang et al. 2018]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Embedded sensors in fabrics have been experimented with for
                  over twenty years and offer the possibility of in situ
                  monitoring of canvas properties: moisture content via
                  electrical resistance and induced strain via fiber optics
                  ([[Zawadzki et al. 2012]]). The problem from a
                  conservation/preventive point of view is that embedded optical
                  devices considerably stiffen the fabric. However, with the
                  present development of haptics and wearable sensors in the
                  military, sports, and gaming industries ([[Muhammad Sayem et
                  al. 2020]]), it is likely that the technology will evolve to
                  enable development of embedded sensors for structural
                  conservation and the monitoring of canvas complexity. Shape
                  memory sensors may also offer an additional option. For
                  example, self-regulating structures that respond to
                  environmental conditions could be woven into fabric ([[Ibrahim
                  et al. 2010]])—and at the least they are bound to be part of
                  future artworks.

                <p>
                  Driven by the need to reduce our carbon footprint,
                  energy-harvesting fabrics are being developed that convert
                  ambient energy into electrical energy. These include
                  dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated into functionalized
                  yarns and made into films that can be spray-coated onto
                  textiles ([[Torah et al. 2018]]), as well as screen-printable
                  polymer film and polymer fibers that can harvest mechanical
                  energy from textiles. Maybe the canvas paintings of the future
                  could provide their own “active” microclimate.

                  This study presents a novel technique to determine the tensile
                  strength of single flax yarn of canvas, using zero-span
                  strength analysis. The technique was applied to both
                  artificially aged fabric and naturally aged canvas from
                  historical artworks, yielding reproducible and representative
                  results. Subsequently, the degree of polymerization of the
                  cellulose was determined by capillary viscometry. A linear
                  correlation could be shown between the degree of cellulose
                  polymerization obtained from capillary viscometry and the
                  tensile strength obtained from zero-span tensile strength
                  measurements. These results demonstrate the value of this
                  technique, which is more straightforward than capillary
                  viscometry and requires significantly smaller samples. This
                  approach offers great potential for determining the mechanical
                  properties of an original canvas and for supporting the
                  decision-making process about conservation treatments.

                <p>
                  In order to make educated decisions about the ability to
                  transport paintings and the potential need for an appropriate
                  conservation treatment, it is crucial to know the mechanical
                  strength of a canvas. However, methods to measure this and
                  related parameters are scarce. Even today, the assessment of
                  original canvas is often based only on its optical appearance,
                  such as browning and yellowing, and pH value. However, these
                  parameters are not directly related to age and mechanical
                  properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Flax is frequently used for the canvases of historical
                  paintings. It is a natural fiber and consists mainly of
                  cellulose. The most dominant degradation process of such
                  canvases is the depolymerization of cellulose by hydrolysis,
                  which in turn influences their mechanical strength
                  ([[Timar-Balazsy and Eastop 1998]]). In 1939, Staudinger and
                  Reinecke investigated a potential correlation between aging,
                  cellulose depolymerization, and the mechanical strength of
                  historical canvas ([[Staudinger and Reinecke 1939]]). However,
                  this correlation has so far not been experimentally proven.
                  For paper, in contrast, a link between the mechanical
                  properties and the degree of cellulose depolymerization has
                  been found ([[Zou et al. 1994]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In textile engineering. the tensile strength of fabrics is
                  determined by using standard protocols that require a minimum
                  length of 200 mm; for the testing of yarns, a minimum length
                  of 250 mm is needed. Those requirements limit their
                  application to conservation research. If large amounts of
                  sample material are available, such as for artificially aged
                  canvas, it is possible to determine the strength of the
                  material using methods such as the standard tensile test
                  method on fabric or yarn, which gives a maximum tensile
                  strength value ([[Reumann 2000]]), but to date no direct
                  correlation between the age-related chemical alterations of
                  the cellulose molecular constitution and the physical
                  consequences for the fabric has been established ([[Young
                  2005]]). The reason for this is the lack of methods to
                  investigate original canvases. Thus, the determination of the
                  degree of cellulose depolymerization by viscometry was until
                  now the only method available to investigate the constitution
                  of original canvas ([[Stoll and Fengel 1981]]). However, the
                  measured degree of polymerization is difficult to assess with
                  respect to the aging process and the mechanical properties.
                  Therefore, a technique for measuring the mechanical properties
                  on smaller components of a canvas such as yarns or fibers is
                  needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yarns are structures comprised of fibers, and a yarn’s
                  geometry is determined by the fibers’ diameter, gradient
                  angle, density, and the homogeneity of the material ([[Peirce
                  1937]]). It is likely that the strong influence the fabric
                  geometry has on the measurements may prevent a direct
                  correlation of the age with tensile strength as determined by
                  the above-mentioned standard methodology. It seems conceivable
                  that the thinnest site of the sample ruptures first, or that
                  thinner single fibers are displaced from longer single fibers
                  during the measurement. Thus, we conclude that to determine a
                  correlation between the degree of polymerization of cellulose
                  and the mechanical properties a novel technique for measuring
                  the tensile strength is needed—one that greatly excludes the
                  influence of the textile geometry on the measurement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To date, three standard methods are used to determine the
                  strength of cellulosic fiber material: (1) the band-pulling
                  method on plain textile structures ([[DIN 1999]]); (2) the
                  determination of the maximal tensile strength on single fibers
                  ([[DIN 2009]]); and (3) the determination of the maximal
                  tensile strength on staple fibers ([[DIN 1996]]). However, as
                  already mentioned, none of these standard techniques fulfills
                  the requirements applicable to original canvas samples. The
                  comparison of the degree of cellulose polymerization with the
                  maximum tensile strength of artificially aged linen (flax
                  fabric), measured with the band-pulling method on plain-weave
                  fabrics, did not yield a correlation ([[Von Reden 2018]]). In
                  this study, we propose that the influence of the fabric
                  geometry during these measurements prevents the resulting
                  values from faithfully resembling the molecular condition of
                  the cellulose, and that the same applies to the determination
                  of the maximum tensile strength on single yarn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the research field of paper analysis, an alternative method
                  for the analysis of single fiber strength is frequently
                  applied to this problem: the determination of the zero-span
                  tensile strength ([[TAPPI 2007]]). The special feature of this
                  method is the fact that the clamping distance is reduced to
                  almost zero, and hence the strength of the fibers is measured
                  at a defined position. In this way, measurement errors arising
                  from the heterogeneity of the material along the overall
                  length of the sample are minimized. In the international
                  literature, the resulting value is named zero-span tensile
                  strength ([[Henniges and Potthast 2015]]; [[Henniges and
                  Potthast 2000]]). Applying the zero-span tensile strength test
                  method to yarn would represent an important technical
                  advancement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Previous studies have reported on this topic, but to date no
                  standardized protocol or validation of the method exists
                  ([[Hackney and Hedley 1984]]; [[Leene et al. 1975]]).
                  Transferring this technique to the conservation of paintings,
                  however, would be highly desirable. The goal of our work was
                  to investigate the applicability of the zero-span tensile
                  strength method to single yarns and to develop a standard
                  protocol. The second aim was to use this technique to study
                  samples derived from original canvas to assess its
                  implementation in conservation research. The overarching
                  question was whether a correlation between the intrinsic
                  viscosity and the maximum tensile strength exists. This study
                  was conducted at the Dresden University of Fine Arts, Germany.

                  The general workflow of this study is as follows: yarn samples
                  were taken from both new and artificially aged fabrics as well
                  as from original canvas paintings. The maximum tensile
                  strength at zero length of single yarn samples was determined
                  using the newly developed method described in more detail
                  below. Then identical sample material was disassembled into
                  single fibers and the intrinsic viscosity (limiting viscosity
                  number) determined.

                  The existing protocol for the zero-span tensile strength
                  determination of paper was modified for its application to
                  yarn samples, and a standard protocol was developed. The
                  general rules for measuring maximum tensile strength also
                  apply to the zero-span tensile strength. The critical
                  difference between the protocols is the clamping distance. In
                  reality, the clamping distance for determining the zero-span
                  tensile strength is set to 0.1 mm in order to avoid
                  compression of the sample. Here, we used a modified version of
                  a testing machine that was originally developed for the
                  analysis of historical paper ([[Lichtblau 2007]]). We used a
                  zwickiLine Z0.5 TS material testing machine equipped with an
                  Xforce precision force sensor (nominal force=500 N), pneumatic
                  sample holders, and an adjustment system for a highly precise
                  arrangement and guidance of the specimens. [<strong>Fig. 16.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/16-Braeunig/16-Braunig_clean/fig-16-1)

                  In order to apply this technology to yarn samples and use it
                  as a standard method for the study of paintings, it was
                  modified for this project. The basis for the study is provided
                  by the standards listed in

                  from which relevant aspects were adopted. The following
                  criteria were developed:

                    <p>
                      Theoretically three different types of samples were
                      conceivable: twisted yarns, untwisted yarns, and single
                      fibers. However, in the case of twisted yarn premature
                      damage of the sample can be excluded. In addition, for
                      this configuration, a maximal correlation of the results
                      with the strength of the canvas is expected.

                      The minimum sample length was determined considering the
                      following points: The sample length should be as short as
                      possible to (potentially) be applicable to original
                      canvases. Samples needed to be long enough to be
                      reproducibly held by the clamps, which require a 2.1 mm
                      operational distance. Hence, a sample length of 5.0 mm for
                      each sample is necessary for the vertical application.

                      A standardized technique for the vertical application of
                      the sample into the clamps with a magnetic clip was
                      developed. Here, the sample was positioned vertically on a
                      metal ruler and fixed inside the clip using an elastic
                      magnet. Then the sample was applied into the clamps of the
                      machine.

                      Thread slippage of the yarn section should be avoided.

                      The measurements should be reproducible within an

                  To develop the standard protocol, test measurements were
                  conducted on a new fabric using the above criteria. The use of
                  an identical fabric ensured the comparability of the different
                  settings of the testing machine. The resulting standard
                  protocol as outlined in

                  For conducting a measurement for one canvas, the following
                  steps were performed:

                    <p>
                      After determining the sample mass and length, the tensile
                      strength was measured on twelve yarn sections (5 mm each)
                      following the standard protocol (<a href="#fig-16-2"><strong>fig. 16.2</strong></a>).
                    </p>
                  </li>

                    <p>
                      To obtain a statistically significant result for the
                      tensile strength for one canvas, it was necessary to
                      measure twelve yarn sections with 5 mm length each. From
                      the maximum tensile load measured in newtons, the
                      diameter-normalized maximal tensile strength
                      (<em>f~H~</em>) was calculated following <em>f</em>~H~ =
                      F/Tt with Tt = fineness (in units of tex) in order to
                      compare yarns of different fineness ([[Reumann 2000]]).

                    <p>
                      To determine the fineness, the mass was divided by the
                      length of the yarn ([[Hartwig and Reumann 2000]]).

                      values were excluded, and the average and the
                      corresponding standard deviation were calculated from the

                <p>
                  The average degree of polymerization has been established in
                  the field of conservation research to describe the degree of
                  decomposition and the molecular condition of cellulose
                  ([[Stoll and Fengel 1981]]). The degree of polymerization is
                  calculated based on the experimentally determined limiting
                  viscosity number. However, for this calculation different
                  methods have been described, leading to different results
                  ([[Stoll and Fengel 1981]]). Thus, in order to directly
                  compare results from different studies, the standard DIN 54
                  270 part 1 suggests omitting the calculation of the degree of
                  polymerization and instead using the limiting viscosity number
                  as the reference value ([[DIN 1976]]). Just like the degree of
                  polymerization, the limiting viscosity number increases as the
                  chain length of the cellulose molecules increases.

                  The intrinsic viscosity of all yarn samples was determined
                  using capillary viscometry. This method allows investigation
                  of original sample material as well, since the necessary
                  sample amount is less than 15 mg. All experiments were
                  performed according to the standard DIN 54 270 part 3 ([[DIN
                  1977]]), with minor modifications ([[Bräunig et al. 2016]]).
                  The basic principle is as follows: The yarn sample is
                  disassembled into single fibers, then dissolved in alkaline
                  iron tartrate system (in German EWNN~mod(NaCl)~), and the
                  viscosity of the resulting solution is determined using a
                  Micro-Ubbelohde viscometer. The time required for a defined
                  volume of a test liquid to pass a defined distance in a
                  capillary of a known diameter is used to calculate the
                  kinematic viscosity of that liquid. The dissolved cellulose
                  sample is inserted into the viscometer, aspirated, and then
                  the flow time back through the device caused by gravity is
                  measured (twice per sample) with two independent fillings. The
                  result given here is the mean value of the two measurements.

                <p>
                  Overall, seventeen different flax fabrics were analyzed: one
                  new fabric, with two additional levels of artificial aging,
                  and fourteen canvas samples from original paintings.
                  Artificial aging was achieved by exposure to light in a
                  Xenotest (42 W/m², filter: &lt; 320 nm, 35°C and 30% RH),
                  followed by a temperature increase (70°C) and cyclically
                  alternating humidity (from 30% to 80% RH over 12 hours). The
                  samples from original paintings—dating from the sixteenth to
                  twentieth centuries—originated from paintings that were
                  processed in the framework of teaching at Dresden University
                  of Fine Arts. The choice of the paintings was driven by the
                  aim of reflecting a broad spectrum of aging. All paintings
                  were mainly untreated and generally had not been stored in a
                  constant climate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the new and artificially aged fabrics, samples of warp
                  and weft were taken from the middle of the fabric. The
                  position and thread direction of the samples from the original
                  canvases differed depending on the condition of each
                  individual painting. For preparation, the samples from the
                  original canvases were soaked in a bath to increase the
                  homogeneity of the starting material. The resulting coloring
                  of the extract showed that dirt, small particles, and (most
                  likely) the sizing could be dissolved. Then the yarns were cut
                  into twelve sections of 5 mm each. To maximize the
                  comparability of the results from the two different methods,
                  identical samples were first used for the tensile strength
                  measurement and then dissolved for the capillary viscometry
                  experiment.

                  The results of the tensile strength measurements confirm that
                  the standard protocol we developed is applicable without any
                  limitation to all yarn samples tested. [<strong>Fig. 16.3a</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/16-Braeunig/16-Braunig_clean/fig-16-3)
                  shows the average of the diameter-normalized maximum tensile
                  strength (<em>f~H~</em> in N/tex) with the corresponding
                  standard deviation for all measured samples. All results for
                  the tensile strength lie between 0.000120 and 0.02744 N/tex.
                  The new fabric before and after artificial aging show the
                  highest values, thus these samples cover the range of weak
                  aging. The samples from the original canvases are found in the
                  range of middle and show strong aging, making it apparent that
                  the artificial aging was not sufficient to reflect the values
                  of the original samples. For the artificially aged fabrics,
                  the warps were generally more stable than the wefts—either
                  those that were unaged or those that had been aged for shorter
                  periods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the historical yarn samples from the nineteenth and
                  twentieth centuries (H1U20–H10K19) the strength decreases with
                  increasing age. In the region with the lowest strength,
                  measured on the samples from the sixteenth to eighteenth
                  centuries, the strength does not correlate with the age.
                  Probably, the strength of these samples is more strongly
                  influenced by further factors, such as aging conditions,
                  pretreatment, and painting technique.

                  shows the results of the capillary viscometry experiments. The
                  analyzed yarn samples cover a broad spectrum of limiting
                  viscosity numbers (GVZ in units of ml/g), which, in contrast
                  to the diameter-normalized maximum tensile strength values
                  (<em>f~H~</em>; see <strong>fig. 16.3a</strong>), show a
                  smaller gap between the artificially and the historically aged
                  samples. Overall, the values lie between 250 and 1976 ml/g.
                  High values were obtained from the new and artificially aged
                  samples. In line with the results of tensile strength (see
                  <strong>fig. 16.3a</strong>), the warps show higher values
                  than the wefts. This phenomenon can be explained by the
                  different yarn quality of the two groups. While the warps in
                  these samples consisted of doubling folded yarns with long
                  single fibers, the wefts were yarns with short single fibers.

                  Surprisingly, we observed an anomaly for the artificially aged
                  wefts that is consistent throughout both methods: the wefts
                  that were aged longer show slightly higher values than wefts
                  aged for shorter periods. Since this phenomenon appears with
                  both methods, the result seems to be sample specific. This
                  anomaly could be caused by the inhomogeneity of the material.
                  In comparison, the historical samples generally show lower
                  values. For technical reasons, the viscosity measurements were
                  conducted at two different temperatures (18°C and 19°C, shown
                  in [<strong>fig. 16.3b</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/16-Braeunig/16-Braunig_clean/fig-16-3)
                  in light and dark gray, respectively).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The correlation of the data determined by the two different
                  methods is plotted in [<strong>fig. 16.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/16-Braeunig/16-Braunig_clean/fig-16-4):
                  the degree of polymerization of the cellulose, represented by
                  the limiting viscosity number (GVZ), and the strength of the
                  tested yarn samples (<em>f~H~</em>), measured by our newly
                  developed protocol. Due to the strong dependence of the
                  viscosity measurement on temperature, the experiments at 18°C
                  and 19°C are plotted separately. For both temperatures, a
                  clear correlation of the limiting viscosity number with the
                  diameter-normalized maximum tensile strength can be found. The
                  data points can be grouped into two separate populations: low
                  strength (<em>f~H~</em> &lt; 0.008 N/tex), consisting of the
                  naturally aged samples, and high strength (<em>f~H~</em> &gt;
                  0.017 N/tex), consisting of new and artificially aged samples.
                  In summary, a linear correlation is observed over the whole
                  data set.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contrast to capillary viscometry, the tensile strength of
                  the yarn measured with zero-span distance still could be
                  influenced by yarn geometry. In addition, for the historic
                  samples, remaining material such as a binding agent may
                  influence the tensile strength. For the low values, the
                  results of both methods do not completely align with the
                  dating of the samples. In other words, a canvas from the
                  sixteenth century may show a higher tensile strength than a
                  canvas from the seventeenth century. This shows that the
                  dating by itself is not sufficient to conclude on the tensile
                  strength. The pretreatments of the canvases and the respective
                  conditions under which the paintings were stored may have a
                  significant influence on their material state.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Comparing our tensile strength results and the empiric
                  impression of the canvases reveals an interesting finding.
                  Generally, the lowest values for intrinsic viscosity and
                  strength reflected the empiric impression of the fragility of
                  the corresponding canvases. In these cases, the canvases were
                  obviously brittle. In contrast, within the major range of the
                  values, for all nonaged and aged samples, no correlation
                  between the values and the empiric impression could be
                  observed. There are no explicit empirically identifiable
                  characteristics that point toward a medium or even a higher
                  loss of tensile strength. An empiric evaluation of the canvas
                  stability is only possible when it already reached a state of
                  fragility that leads to breaking or cracking at low
                  application of a force, such as during handling. These results
                  suggest that an empiric assessment as a basis for a
                  conservational treatment has only limited scope and that an
                  exact method to determine the stability of the canvas is
                  needed.

                  Conclusion and Outlook
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In this study, we developed a novel, standard protocol for the
                  determination of the zero-span tensile strength of yarn
                  sections. It delivers, for the first time, trustworthy results
                  for the strength of the cellulose because the influence of the
                  yarn geometry is reduced to a minimum. Compared to capillary
                  viscometry, the zero-span tensile strength measurement is
                  easier and faster to conduct. The necessary amount of sample
                  is similar, and the time effort is reduced. For example,
                  thirty tensile strength measurements can be conducted in an
                  hour.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A direct correlation of the intrinsic viscosity with the
                  tensile strength of historical canvases could be established.
                  It could be confirmed that the mechanical strength of yarn
                  depends directly on the degree of degradation of cellulose.
                  The mechanical properties are directly measured, as opposed to
                  determining the degree of polymerization by the intrinsic
                  viscosity of the dissolved material. Hence, this method has
                  great potential to mechanically evaluate the degradation of a
                  canvas as a valuable alternative to viscometry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following up on our studies, the measurement of lower strength
                  values would be of value. Therefore, the use of significantly
                  finer microstrength sensors is recommended. By increasing the
                  number of investigated paintings, we may be able to obtain a
                  broader set of comparative data.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In comparison to the current standard techniques of tensile
                  strength determination, the required sample material could be
                  significantly reduced to 60 mm of fiber per canvas in total.
                  Nevertheless, ethically, such an intervention represents a
                  significant decision for an original painting. Thus, in its
                  current state, this method is best suited for scientific
                  research. For its application as a standard method for
                  original paintings, further optimization and reduction of
                  sample requirements are needed. Furthermore, it must be taken
                  into account that, depending on the painting, the samples are
                  usually taken from the tacking margin and not from the center
                  of the canvas. Due to differences in degradation mechanisms in
                  tensioned and nontensioned canvases, different results can be
                  expected in the two areas ([[von Reden 2018]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The measurement of zero-span tensile strength serves the
                  overarching goal of being able to reproducibly extrapolate
                  from the strength of the measured position to the strength of
                  the whole original canvas. For this, the influence of yarn and
                  fabric geometry on canvas strength must be investigated. By
                  knowing these relationships, an assessment of the strength of
                  the canvas should be possible, which can then serve as a basis
                  for decisions on stabilization treatments, such as tear
                  mending, strip-lining, or lining, which are of utmost
                  relevance to the conservator.

                  The Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM), together with its
                  branch museum, the Renwick Gallery, stewards a national
                  collection containing thousands of paintings that span more
                  than three centuries of American art. Established in 1829, the
                  collection at SAAM moved to its current location in the Old
                  Patent Office Building in 1968. This was just two years after
                  paintings conservator Charles Olin formed the first
                  conservation lab for the collection. The paintings in the
                  collection have been cared for by four generations of
                  conservators over the past fifty years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The conservation records reflect evolving approaches to the
                  methodology and protocols used in the structural treatment of
                  paintings, as they encapsulate the training, experience, and
                  philosophical approaches to treatments brought by each
                  painting conservator. Research into these past treatments
                  continues in order to gain a greater understanding of the
                  materials used as well as the application methods and overall
                  intent of the treatments. The initial phase of research
                  focused on wax-resin linings and their effectiveness and
                  longevity as a treatment option for paintings in the
                  collection, and through the use of instrumental analysis,
                  compared specific recipes recorded in treatments with samples
                  from the paintings exhibiting lining deterioration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The impetus for the focus on wax-resin linings began several
                  years ago, when a significant number of those lining
                  treatments completed in the mid-to-late twentieth century were
                  beginning to fail or showed early signs of failure. Modes of
                  failure included but were not limited to pocketed delamination
                  of the lining substrate, returned cupping and flaking within
                  the paint and ground layers, and raised craquelure in the
                  painted surface. Of note was the delamination of linings
                  related to works that were on prolonged view in the galleries
                  or had traveled on loan. The latter was of particular concern,
                  as these paintings were considered the best for loan based on
                  the very fact that they were wax-resin lined, and therefore
                  considered stable and nearly impervious to environmental
                  fluctuations or mechanical stresses.

                  Collection Survey and Lining Reconstructions
                </h2>
                <p>
                  A survey of the Lunder Conservation Center treatment records
                  was initiated to identify lined paintings in the museum
                  collection. As of April 2019, this survey yielded a
                  preliminary dataset of 958 linings carried out at the museum
                  from the 1950s to present. The dataset was then filtered to
                  exclude paintings mounted to solid supports, adhesives
                  irrelevant to this study (glue-paste and synthetic), and
                  wax-resin adhesives where the materials were unidentified. The
                  final dataset yielded fifty oil-on-canvas paintings lined
                  between 1950 and 1993. The paintings were by thirty-seven
                  different artists and on a variety of fabric supports (linen,
                  cotton, and burlap). All were wax-resin lined but nearly a
                  dozen different recipes had been used. The linings were added
                  to address a variety of condition issues including tears,
                  generalized flaking, or as a preventive measure (no condition
                  issues noted).

                  Six recipes were frequently used in the twentieth-century
                  lining treatments and were found in forty-three of the fifty
                  surveyed paintings ([<strong>table 17.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/17-Kerr_clean/table-17-1)).
                  These six recipes were then selected for comparative and
                  categorical reasoning in order to answer the following
                  queries:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Had other institutions also observed wax-resin lining
                      failure? This would be determined by examining a recipe
                      frequently used by conservators working in a range of
                      institutions: SAAM 1.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Was the type of resin, type of wax, or their relative
                      proportions a source of failure? Two sets of recipes would
                      be compared to evaluate this question: SAAM 2–3 versus
                      SAAM 4–5.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Did the use, substitution, or absence of a particular
                      resin or an organic wax contribute to failure? This would
                      be determined using SAAM 6.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  The six recipes were each reconstructed to better understand
                  how the lining adhesives were aging and for comparison against
                  aged samples from known examples of use (the case studies
                  listed in [<strong>table 17.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/17-Kerr_clean/table-17-1)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  One case study was selected to represent each lining recipe,
                  and samples of excess wax-resin adhesive taken from each. The
                  case studies represent a variety of painting techniques, as
                  well as previous condition issues. In the case of both William
                  H. Johnson paintings, they had been exposed to extremely poor
                  environmental and storage conditions prior to acquisition. In
                  the case of <em>The Lesson</em> by Hugo Ballin and
                  <em>Plenty</em> by Kenyon Cox, those works entered the
                  collection almost immediately after their completion by the
                  artists. In addition, the case studies reflected differences
                  in lining supports, and lining recipes that are often repeated
                  on other works by the same artist (particularly in the works
                  by Johnson and Bannister).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ingredients used in the recipes were sourced from various
                  vendors, inventory at the Lunder Conservation Center, and
                  donations coordinated with institutions and private practice
                  conservation studios.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The six reconstructed recipes were used in mock-up linings of
                  thirty-six test paintings. The test paintings consisted of
                  commercial acrylic-primed cotton, acrylic-primed linen, and
                  oil-primed linen canvases mounted to 20 x 25.5 cm (8 x 10
                  inch) wooden stretchers (twelve each). The authors marked each
                  canvas with graphite (underdrawing) and applied Weber Permalba
                  zinc and titanium white, Gamblin yellow ochre, or Old Holland
                  red ochre oil paints; four of each canvas type was painted out
                  with each pigment type. These pigments were chosen based on
                  the practical experience of the authors and conventional
                  wisdom that they dry quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Viscosity was divided into three categories: thin, moderate,
                  and thick oil paint. The thin layer was diluted in mineral
                  spirits and applied lightly using 2.5 cm (1 inch) nylon flat
                  brushes so that the graphite underdrawing remained visible.
                  The moderate layer was conservatively applied from the tube by
                  brush (brushed gently to an even layer with little brush
                  marking), obscuring the underdrawing. The thick layer was
                  liberally applied from the tube by brush and palette knife to
                  build up impasto. All mock-ups were aged for four days at room
                  temperature and then desiccated for fifteen days in a Lab-Line
                  L-C oven set between 32°C–40°C (90°F–105°F). Once the oil
                  paint was completely dry, each mock-up was photographed before
                  treatment, removed from its stretcher, and lined to 38 x 43 cm
                  (15 x 17 inch) fabric supports, distributed evenly between
                  linen and fiberglass.

                  Ingredients for each reconstructed lining recipe (see [<strong>table 17.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/17-Kerr_clean/table-17-1))
                  were measured by weight and bundled in cheesecloth in packages
                  weighing 1 kg each. The six cheesecloth packages were added to
                  24 x 24 x 9.5 cm (9.5 x 9.5 x3.75 inch) Gotham Steel nonstick
                  fry pans and heated on an iSiLER CHK-S1809NE portable
                  induction cooktop to 126°C–238°C (260°F–460°F). Large
                  impurities were separated out as the molten wax-resin
                  components permeated through the cheesecloth. Once filtration
                  was complete, cooktop temperatures were reduced to 82°C
                  (180°F). The molten mixture was transferred to the mock-ups
                  (canvas reverse) and secondary support fabrics using polyester
                  paint rollers. The cotton/linen/fiberglass edges were masked
                  in 10 cm (4 inch) wide strips with silicone-release Mylar to
                  prevent excess buildup of lining adhesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once coated with the wax-resin mixture, each mock-up painting
                  was centered on its secondary support, placed on the vacuum
                  hot table, and sealed inside a silicone-release Mylar
                  envelope. The vacuum suction pressure was set to 1 Hg (0.49
                  psi) and the heat to 74°C (165°F). Emergency thermal blankets
                  were used to cover the Mylar envelope to encourage even heat
                  distribution. After fifteen to twenty minutes of monitoring,
                  the heat was turned off and the emergency thermal blankets
                  removed. Then the mock-ups were hand-pressed in a Union Jack
                  pattern through the Mylar envelope to push out excess
                  wax-resin adhesive. Brayers were used over the thin and
                  moderate paint layers, and cloth diapers were used over thick
                  impasto. The lining procedures followed for the research
                  project reflect treatment reports as well as oral history
                  interviews with former staff conservators.

                  Scraped lining adhesive samples were collected from eighteen
                  of the fifty surveyed paintings (including all six case study
                  paintings), raw wax and resin ingredients, and each lining
                  reconstruction adhesive. Technical examination was carried out
                  in May and June 2019 at the Winterthur Museum’s Scientific
                  Research and Analysis Laboratory (SRAL).

                  For the first stage of analysis, samples were prepared for
                  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The samples
                  were flattened onto diamond cells to be analyzed with a Thermo
                  Scientific Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer. The samples were
                  spread out as a translucent film using a stainless steel
                  microroller, and the diamond cell placed on the platform of a
                  Nicolet Continuμm Infrared Microscope. One or two target sites
                  were selected on the diamond cell, and data was collected in
                  transmission mode. Spectral resolution was set at 4 cm^-1^ for
                  128 scans (each scan ranged from 4000 to 650 cm^-1^). The
                  resulting spectra were interpreted using OMNIC Series Software
                  (version 8.0) and compared to the Infrared and Raman Users
                  Group (IRUG) spectral database.

                  During the second stage of analysis, samples were transferred
                  to Thermo Fisher Scientific autosampler vials to be analyzed
                  with an Agilent Technologies 7820 gas chromatograph and
                  Agilent 5975 Mass Selective Detector (GC/MSD). The autosampler
                  vials were treated with 1 part Grace Alltech Meth-Prep II
                  reagent in 2 parts benzene (≤100 µL) and warmed in a Lab-Line
                  Multi-Blok heater at 60°C for an hour. The derivatized sample
                  was pipetted into a vial insert and cooled to room
                  temperature. From each vial, 1 μL of the sample was injected
                  into the HP-5ms GC column (5% phenyl methyl siloxane; flow
                  rate of 1.5 mL/minute; film thickness of 30 m x 250 μm x 0.25

                  Each case study painting, SAAM reconstructed recipe, and raw
                  material sample was analyzed using FTIR and GC/MSD. The goal
                  of FTIR analysis was to compare the transmission band pattern
                  of the historical linings to the reconstructed recipes
                  ([<strong>fig. 17.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/17-Kerr_clean/fig-17-1)).
                  This comparison helped measure the efficacy of replicating
                  SAAM’s historic lining recipes. FTIR was not used to confirm
                  the presence or absence of the raw material components, as
                  that step would require a more discerning analytical
                  technique.

                  GC/MSD provided supplemental information about the material
                  composition of each adhesive mixture. Odd-numbered chain
                  length hydrocarbons and certain fatty acids (including
                  palmitic, stearic, and lignoceric acids) identified beeswax in
                  the sample. Odd- and even-numbered hydrocarbons with a reduced
                  fatty acid content indicated the presence of microcrystalline
                  wax in the unadulterated samples such as
                  <em>The Windmill</em> and SAAM 6. However, the presence of
                  microcrystalline wax was more difficult to detect in samples
                  containing a mixture of ingredients. Multiwax W-445 was
                  present in all 12 samples; however, it was detected in only
                  three case study paintings (<em>The Lesson</em>,
                  <em>Plenty</em>, and <em>The Windmill</em>) and four recreated
                  recipes (SAAM 2, and 4–6). In this data subset, beeswax was
                  absent from six of the seven samples.

                  Some natural resins were successfully identified with GC/MSD:
                  5-dammarenolic acid methyl ester signaled the presence of
                  dammar, dehydroabietic acid and 7-oxo-dehydroabietic acid<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  signaled colophony, and α- or β-amyrin signaled gum elemi. The
                  two proprietary resins Zonarez B-85 and Piccolyte S-85 were
                  not conclusively detected with GC/MSD ([<strong>fig. 17.2</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/17-Kerr_clean/fig-17-2),

                  This could be the result of shortcomings in the sample
                  derivatization process or sensitivity of the GC/MSD
                  instrument. Other research publications have also cited
                  discrepancies in identifying resins due to oxidation,
                  depolymerization, or cross-linking of the material as it ages
                  ([[Bleton and Tchapla 2009]]; [[Lluveras et. al 2010]];

                  and associated SAAM recipes were analyzed with Py-GC/MSD:
                  <em>Oak Trees</em> and SAAM 2; <em>The Lesson</em> and SAAM 4;
                  <em>Plenty</em> and SAAM 5. Raw samples of Zonarez B-85 and
                  Piccolyte S-85 were also pyrolyzed as a control standard for
                  data comparison. The results indicated that Py-GC/MSD was more
                  successful detecting the odd- and even-numbered hydrocarbons
                  present in microcrystalline wax. This method was also more
                  proficient detecting the polylimonene monomers, dimers, and
                  trimers associated with the two proprietary resins ([<strong>table 17.3</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/17-Kerr_clean/table-17-3);
                  see [<strong>fig. 17.2</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/17-Kerr_clean/fig-17-2)).
                  After reviewing the GC/MSD data in comparison with the
                  Py-GC/MSD data, the GC/MSD extracted ion chromatograms (EICs)
                  were found to contain “humps” along the baseline that matched
                  the pattern for polylimonene ([<strong>fig. 17.3</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/17-Kerr_clean/fig-17-3)).
                  Other recipe ingredients—beeswax, dammar, colophony, and gum
                  elemi—were also clearly identified with Py-GC/MSD.

                  In most cases, FTIR is simply not suitable for characterizing
                  most of these potentially complex recipes. It was also
                  difficult to detect the presence of synthetic waxes in many of
                  the samples using GC/MSD. This may depend on the type of wax,
                  the amount, or even the age of the sample itself. Sampling
                  excess wax-resin adhesive from all unidentified textile
                  linings is impractical, but the reconstructions and analysis
                  prove that even when known materials are present, they are not
                  readily identified. It is possible lining mixtures may be
                  characterized by sensorial qualities to the examiner,
                  particularly if they can be compared against the
                  reconstructions. This rough characterization may allow for a
                  generalized prediction of a particular lining’s failure
                  potential, when considered in tandem with the exhibition
                  history and previous condition issues of the painting in
                  question.

                  The study has provided an understanding of how pervasive
                  wax-resin linings are in the collection, and how late the
                  practice remained in use. The frequency of lining treatments
                  was likely prompted by extensive loan requests and the
                  contemporaneous belief that wax-resin linings were a suitable
                  preventative measure. While this analysis has been useful,
                  many initial questions remain unanswered. We have a foundation
                  with which to test future hypotheses on how these materials
                  deteriorate, although the methods for testing these hypotheses
                  must still be designed. Since the reconstructions were lined,
                  areas of impasto have already been observed to contribute to
                  lining delamination in the unstretched lined mock-ups, raising
                  new questions about environment, tension, and percussive
                  movement.

                  It is the hope of the authors that these mock-ups and this
                  preliminary study will provide a resource and reference for
                  future fellows and researchers to enrich our collective
                  understanding of the aging and failure mechanisms of wax-resin
                  linings.

                  A research project was carried out between 2011 and 2015 at
                  the Complutense University of Madrid, the aim of which was to
                  suggest improvements to guarantee future conservation of
                  canvases lined with a glue-paste adhesive called
                  <em>gacha</em>. We started with three objectives: documenting
                  the origin of recipes and the different methods used for this
                  treatment in Spain and Europe, as there is still little
                  knowledge about this kind of lining; choosing case studies;
                  and finally, carrying out a series of experimental tests to
                  evaluate the performance of the basic materials in the recipes
                  and of some variants in the textiles often used as lining
                  supports.

                  <strong>Introduction</strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The proposal to carry out a research project on glue-paste
                  linings arose during a course on structural treatments of
                  paintings on canvas led by Vishwa Mehra and Matteo Rossi-Doria
                  at the Universitat Politècnica de València. The scarcity of
                  scientific knowledge about linings carried out in the past
                  with glue paste (in Spanish, traditionally called
                  <em>a la gacha</em>) was exacerbated by the gradual abandoning
                  of this procedure, now replaced by modern synthetic adhesives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The project—entitled Materials and Methods of Glue-Paste
                  Linings for the Reinforcement of Canvas Paintings:
                  Documentation, Functionality, and Conservation—was a
                  coordinated effort, carried out between 2011 and 2015 by a
                  group of sixteen international specialists, a number of
                  Spanish institutions, and the support of several
                  companies.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  It was coordinated from Spain by the Complutense University of
                  Madrid and funded by a grant<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  from the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (MINECO).

                  The Need for Lining Through the Ages
                </h2>
                <p>
                  It is evident that lining has allowed many paintings on canvas
                  to survive into the present. Some linings are as much as three
                  hundred years old. In Spain and most of the rest of Europe,
                  linings were carried out since the seventeenth century on
                  using linen cloth and glue-paste as an adhesive ([<strong>fig. 18.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/18-Calvo_clean/fig-18-1)).
                  This procedure remained in practice until the 1990s, when
                  synthetic adhesives came to prevail in the field of
                  conservation. Especially in Holland and the humid Atlantic
                  countries, glue paste was often replaced by wax resin from the
                  nineteenth to early twentieth centuries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Spain, it was not only the passing of time and the lack of
                  care that caused the poor condition of the works, but also the
                  historical vicissitudes of the country, some of which, we now
                  know, led to the need for numerous treatments to the
                  paintings’ supports. For example, on Christmas Eve in 1734, a
                  fire broke out in the Real Alcázar de Madrid, which housed the
                  royal collections, many of which are now in the Museo del
                  Prado. Many paintings burned, and others were in such a bad
                  state that they had to be cut into pieces—and as a result many
                  canvases were lined. Juan García de Miranda and Andrés de la
                  Calleja were the first court painters put in charge of
                  restorations. Their inventories recount the works saved, for
                  example, Titian’s
                  <em>Charles V at the Battle of Mühlberg</em>, which they
                  identified as being in very bad condition ([[Barreno Sevillano
                  1980]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Between 1808 and 1814, during the Napoleonic Wars, many works
                  were taken to Paris from different parts of Spain (Cádiz,
                  Sevilla, Madrid) and arrived in terrible condition. Before
                  being returned to Spain, some canvases were treated with
                  linings in France, such as
                  <em>Juan the Patrician’s Dream</em> by Murillo. Similarly,
                  some paintings on panels were transferred to canvas, including
                  among others, Raphael’s
                  <em>Christ Falls on the Way to Calvary</em>, also known as
                  <em>El Pasmo de Sicilia</em> ([[González Mozo and Alonso
                  2011]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), the great works of art
                  at the Museo del Prado and other areas on the front line were
                  evacuated to avoid damage during the fighting. Despite the
                  care with which they were packed and transported, incidents
                  occurred that caused some canvases to tear, and they were
                  later lined; these include Goya’s
                  <em>The 2nd of May 1808 in Madrid,</em> also known as
                  <em>La carga de los mamelucos.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1828, the Sala de Restauración at the Museo del Prado was
                  created by royal decree. Official posts of liners were set up
                  and filled by competitive examination. The fact that there
                  were professional specialists in lining shows that this kind
                  of treatment was frequently being carried out. We can
                  therefore count on a huge quantity of works lined with
                  glue-paste in Spain, many of which are very well preserved.
                  For example, of the forty-nine Velazquez paintings studied in
                  the Museo del Prado, only seven (about 14%) had not been
                  lined, and of the paintings attributed to El Greco, fifty-one
                  were studied and only six had not been lined (about 11.7%). If
                  we apply an average percentage of 13% to the 6,367 paintings
                  on canvas held by the Museo del Prado at the end of 2019, we
                  can hypothesize that more than eight hundred have not been
                  lined, and more than five thousand could have been lined.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  These numbers lead us to reflect on the durability of these
                  linings and the future conservation of all those works: which
                  conservation conditions are the most appropriate for their
                  preservation, and what should be done when the adhesives start
                  aging and failing?

                  Among the aims of the project was to get a better
                  understanding of the historical glue-paste recipes and methods
                  of applying treatments. We then proposed using a sample recipe
                  and making models and tests that would allow us to determine
                  their possible efficiency and the process of
                  deterioration—that is, to study and verify the present
                  suitability of a reinforcement treatment that evolved over
                  more than three hundred years in Europe, especially its
                  suitability for paintings that were treated with this adhesive
                  previously. We know that this method presents little toxicity,
                  employs materials similar to and compatible with most
                  paintings on canvas, and is reversible, inexpensive, and
                  sustainable compared with modern synthetic adhesives, which
                  have certain advantages but also disadvantages (some plastic
                  materials need high temperature to activate the adhesive, for
                  example). In addition, we wanted to use the experimental
                  results to suggest improvements and guidelines for preventive
                  conservation and future preservation of paintings lined in
                  this way.

                  The project was organized in three parts: a documentary work
                  or study, an experimental study, and the sharing of the
                  research as it was carried out ([<strong>fig. 18.2</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/18-Calvo_clean/fig-18-2),

                <p>
                  For the documentary stage we consulted treatises, archival
                  documents, and various bibliographies and sent questionnaires
                  to various European professionals and institutions. We used
                  two types of questionnaires: one for the cases treated in the
                  more distant past and another for lining treatments carried
                  out in the twentieth century. More than sixty questionnaires
                  were sent, although the amount of information received
                  differed greatly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was not easy to find all the recipes used. In some cases,
                  old documentary information presented the ingredients in
                  invoices, but it did not detail how they were prepared and
                  applied. Similarly, we met with certain reticence from
                  conservator-restorers when it came to explaining the recipes
                  they were currently using, since many of them were personal
                  variations developed by the professionals themselves.

                  The Origin of the Use of *<em>Gacha</em>*, or Glue Paste
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Knowing the materials used to prepare a canvas is essential to
                  understanding the behavior of the lining treatment. With
                  reference to the recipe, materials, and ingredients used in
                  canvases in Spain, interesting research has been done (e.g.,
                  [[Gayo and Jover de Celis 2010]]), but we still have a lot to
                  learn. For example, the presence of ashes in the preparatory
                  layers has only recently been confirmed in paintings ([[Jover
                  de Celis and Gayo 2014]]; [[Carò, Centeno, and Mahon 2018]]),
                  although it appeared in recipes and treatises.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through the documents we know that from the moment people
                  started painting on canvas, a flour paste was used to prepare
                  the canvas. Giorgio Vasari has written about flour with walnut
                  oil, glue, and white lead for preparing the canvas ([[Vasari
                  (1568) 1998|, 119]]). An anonymous Spanish manuscript from the
                  end of the sixteenth century also mentions preparing the
                  canvas with glue, flour, and gypsum and states that “if it
                  were all flour, it would be better” ([[Bruquetas Galán
                  1998]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  We find the same in Francisco Pacheco’s treatise from the
                  mid-seventeenth century: “Some work with flour or mill-dust
                  paste, cooking oil and a little honey (which you can eat even
                  if you are not hungry); they apply a coating of this to a
                  well-stretched canvas to cover over the pores … But experience
                  has taught me that any paste of gypsum, flour or ash gets damp
                  and with time rots the canvas and the painting comes out in
                  scabs” ([[Pacheco (1638) 1990|, 481]]). And Antonio Palomino
                  relates similar concerns in 1715, when explaining how to
                  prepare the mixture by boiling and shaking it to avoid lumps:
                  <em>gacha</em> paste with flour and water, honey and a little
                  linseed oil ([[Palomino (1715) 1947|, 483]]). In some cases,
                  the presence of flour paste has been identified by scientific
                  analysis ([[Helwig and Daly Hartin 1999]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A treatise by Spaniard Vicente Poleró published in the
                  mid-nineteenth century points to the lining of the canvas as
                  an essential operation ([[Poleró (1853 and 1866) 2018]]). He
                  describes the procedure: cover the paint surface with paper,
                  and apply the adhesive to both the lining fabric mounted on a
                  loom and to the original canvas on the back and then iron
                  until it is completely dry. The idea was not to simply
                  reinforce the support, but also to fix the layers of color
                  with an impregnation of glue paste (which was surely much more
                  compatible with the original materials than modern plastic
                  adhesives).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using the information gathered and the results of the
                  questionnaire we were able to establish the different
                  ingredients used in the recipes and their function in the
                  mixture: thickener, adhesive, fungicide, humectant, and so
                  forth ([<strong>table 18.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/18-Calvo_clean/table-18-1)).

                <p>
                  In older recipes for <em>gacha</em> paste, such as those of
                  Juan García de Miranda in 1735 ([<strong>fig. 18.3</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/18-Calvo_clean/fig-18-3)),
                  we find flour (the main component of which is starch), honey,
                  walnut oil, and <em>grasilla</em> (juniper resin). Among the
                  ingredients of the Poleró recipe we also find garlic, glue,
                  and linseed oil. Later formulas mention molasses, Venetian
                  turpentine, oxgall, vinegar, Italian <em>colletta</em>, alum,
                  flax seeds, and phenol. In Spain, wheat flour was typically
                  used, but in France, Italy, and Portugal we find mention of
                  rye flour. The glue used varies from strong or bone glue
                  (called in Spanish carpenter’s glue) to hide or rabbit-skin
                  glue. And more recent recipes add Plextol B&nbsp;500 as an adhesive
                  and plasticizer.

                  María Luisa Gómez has noted several characteristics of lining
                  with <em>gacha</em> paste ([[Gómez 1998]]), for example that
                  “there is no change in color, or only very slight change.
                  Also, that the high moisture content allows for the smoothing
                  out of cracks. However, the mixture is very hygroscopic and
                  sensitive to humidity. There is a risk that the original
                  canvas will shrink. There is a danger of fungal growth.
                  Adhesion reduces rapidly in bad weather conditions, and it
                  becomes hard and fragile. It has an acid pH. It requires the
                  applying of heat.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  She thought that the use of Venetian turpentine and other
                  resins was not justified because they were insoluble in water,
                  darkened, and became more fragile, and therefore suggested
                  simplified recipes made up of only starch and animal glue with
                  a few drops of fungicide, and that they be applied cold and
                  used only for lining in dry climates.

                <h3 id="case-studies" tabindex="-1">Case Studies</h3>
                <p>
                  For some cases of lined works, we were able to find references
                  to the date and to the restorers who carried out the
                  treatment, and we were even able to analyze the
                  <em>gacha</em> adhesive present in them, such as those
                  analyzed by María Dolores Gayo at the Museo del Prado, those
                  in the Instituto del Patrimonio Cultural de España, and
                  Ribera’s <em>Crucified</em> <em>Christ</em>, analyzed by
                  Andrés Sánchez Ledesma (Arte-Lab S.L.) ([[Diputación Foral de
                  Álava 2018]]). Analyses of the <em>gacha</em> are complex
                  because sometimes it is difficult to determine the exact
                  composition. Apart from the difficulty of accessing
                  representative samples, they are possibly not very homogeneous
                  adhesives, and the quantities of certain additives were too
                  small to be identified. We should also bear in mind other
                  treatments and products applied to the paintings over the
                  years, which may interfere in the analytical results.

                      For this painting, we also were able to locate the
                      original 1955 gacha recipe, and to examine the state of
                      the lining via cross sections ([<strong>fig. 18.5</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/18-Calvo_clean/fig-18-5)).

                  Both of the latter paintings have additional canvas strips to
                  widen them. We know that <em>The Spinners</em> was lined 1785
                  by Jacinto Gómez, and perhaps he carried out the widening of
                  the painting, although the painting’s measurements vary from
                  one inventory to another at different periods, probably due to
                  adaptations for specific locations. During the last
                  intervention on the painting, many repaints were detected,
                  covering damage that may have arisen from shrinkage when using
                  a new close-weft canvas or been caused by burns during ironing
                  ([[Macarrón, Calvo, and Gil 2017]]).

                  For the documentary study, we gathered recipes, materials, and
                  tools used for <em>gacha</em> linings. We collected invoices
                  for products bought for lining and as much data referring to
                  these as we could find, such as the restorer’s signature on
                  the back of some canvases. Thus, in the Royal Palace we found
                  an order for materials bearing painter-restorer Juan García de
                  Miranda’s signature from 1735, in which the materials for the
                  lining are listed ([[Macarrón, Calvo, and Gil 2013]]).

                  gathered in Spain was much larger than that from other
                  European countries taking part in the project. Likewise, the

                <p>
                  Following in the wake of other experimental studies ([[Daly
                  Hartin et al. 2011]]), we decided to start a scientific study
                  of the materials of a glue-paste lining, starting with the
                  basic ingredients: flour, glue, and cloth. Thus, a number of
                  tests and mock-ups were carried out to assess the behavior of
                  the lining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We used an animal glue chosen from previous tests because of
                  its bloom strength of 240–250. Four types of flour with
                  differing protein content were used: two kinds of finely
                  ground white wheat flour (different brands), coarse-ground
                  semi–whole wheat flour, and coarse-ground semi–whole rye
                  flour. Two kinds of linen fabric were also used: open and
                  closed weft.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  The adhesive was prepared at the Universitat Politècnica de
                  València, adhesive films were made for analysis, and the
                  linings were carried out. Some of the samples were placed on
                  stretchers and some were not.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The samples were sent to the Centre Interdiciplinaire de
                  Conservation et de Restauration du Patrimoine (CICRP) in
                  Marseilles for accelerated aging and study of susceptibility
                  to biodeterioration (estimate of mold growth and pest
                  infestation). They were also sent to Valencia (for
                  morphological studies using optical and scanning electron
                  microscope [SEM]), Copenhagen (examination of cross sections
                  of mock-ups with optical microscopy [OM] and tensile and peel
                  tests), and Maastricht (investigation of cracking using
                  reflectance transformation imaging [RTI]). Members of the
                  research team who specialized in the different techniques
                  worked in each of these places. Some of the samples were
                  studied before and after artificial aging: we measured
                  viscosity and pH, used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
                  (FTIR) for the characterization of the original materials and
                  lining adhesives, and carried out morphological analysis using
                  OM, SEM, and RTI. We also carried out tests of mechanical
                  traction performance and peeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The partial results of these tests included chemical
                  characterization, morphological analysis, studies on
                  mechanical behavior, and biodeterioration ([[Fuster-López et.

                  The third phase of the project was to share the work by
                  disseminating it widely so as to familiarize professionals
                  with this kind of canvas lined with glue-paste. The first
                  objectives of the project were shown in the Museo
                  Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid, in 2012, along with the state of

                  the critical recovery of traditional lining methods
                  ([[Rossi-Doria 2013]]). In a similar context, an article was
                  published comparing the lining systems used in Portugal and
                  Spain ([[Calvo, Maltieira, and Barbosa 2014]]).

                  During the workshop, a wide range of adhesive formulations
                  were tested on facsimiles. Thanks to the Avangrid Foundation

                <p>
                  In certain historic cases, we found linings with glue paste
                  that had changed and completely lost its adhesiveness, which
                  led to its removal. We also found that there are now new
                  alternatives and methodologies for structural treatment of
                  paintings on canvas (such as strip lining, tear mending, and
                  suction tables), but importantly, there are also new criteria
                  as regards structural canvas treatments. This should not,
                  however, justify a loss of understanding and knowledge of
                  linings with glue paste.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thanks to the project described in this essay, we have learned
                  that hundreds of paintings in Spain are lined with glue
                  paste—some three centuries ago and others more recently. Most
                  are in good condition. However, more information is needed
                  about works lined <em>a la gacha</em>: the recipes and
                  application methods used and the environmental conditions of
                  conservation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In experimental studies ([[Fuster-López et. al 2017]]) we
                  discovered variables in biodegradation, which depends on the
                  fineness of the flour, the proportions of flour and glue, and
                  the kind of starch and protein when the proportion of flour to
                  glue is constant. <em>Gacha</em> recipes with semiwhole flour
                  are more likely to biodeteriorate than those made with finely
                  milled white flours, and the protein content of the cereal
                  used affects the degradation process. Regarding the mechanical
                  and dimensional stability of linings with glue paste, we found
                  differences related to the kind of flour used, the degree of
                  milling or grinding, and the thickness of the weft in the
                  canvas used for lining. This suggests that conservation
                  strategies for the long-term care of lined paintings must be
                  carefully assessed, taking into consideration the kind of
                  flour used in the adhesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It would be useful to continue testing to determine the
                  different additives in the traditional recipes (garlic,
                  oxgall, Venetian turpentine, disinfectants) to understand the
                  role these products played in the lining and their effects.
                  But on the basis of our findings and in the light of the
                  current condition of works lined <em>a la gacha</em>, we must
                  raise the following questions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Might a version of this adhesive be appropriate nowadays?
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Could it be used as a cold, or almost cold, contact
                      adhesive?
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Might it be advisable for cases where fixing paint layers
                      is necessary?
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Which are the most appropriate conservation conditions for
                      works lined in this way?
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Might it be an alternative for the necessary relining of
                      paintings that already have this kind of adhesive?
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  Lining treatments and ideas about these treatments are
                  reviewed, with a focus on the innovative period following the

                <p>
                  The developments in the structural treatment of paintings in
                  the late 1970s and early 1980s had a tremendous influence on
                  subsequent practice and research. Conservators trained during
                  the late ’70s, such as the author Debra Daly Hartin, were
                  immersed in the content of the 1974 Greenwich Conference on
                  Comparative Lining Techniques and its follow-up, Lining of
                  Paintings—A Reassessment, held in Ottawa in 1976. Recognition
                  of the deficiencies of past lining treatments, combined with
                  the rise of preventive conservation, led to a less
                  interventive, less aggressive, and more considered approach to
                  structural treatments. New methods, equipment, adhesives, and
                  lining supports were introduced. New research into the
                  mechanical behavior of paintings sought to inform the aims and
                  impact of our treatments. Written from the point of view of a
                  painting conservator working with conservation scientists at
                  the Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI), this paper will
                  discuss specific examples of how research influenced
                  laboratory practice.

                  Overview of Developments in the Structural Treatment of
                  Paintings during the 1970s and 1980s
                </h2>
                <p>
                  It is important to recognize the research and innovation that
                  influenced the field in the 1970s and 1980s, setting the stage
                  for our own research program and treatment development at CCI.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Papers and discussion during the 1975 ICOM-CC conference in
                  Venice led to a revaluation of treatment practices. “All at
                  once” structural treatments, using heat and significant vacuum
                  pressure, were the norm before the 1970s. Vishwa Mehra
                  countered with a much less interventive, stepwise approach
                  ([[Mehra 1975a]]; [[Mehra 1978]]; [[Mehra 1981]]). Each
                  painting was considered as structurally unique, each aspect of
                  the structural treatment (out-of-plane distortions, tears,
                  flaking, flattening, lining, etc.) was a separate step, and
                  only the necessary treatment steps were undertaken.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As part of his system, Mehra used a low-pressure “cold”
                  table.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Like the tables introduced by Bent Hacke in the 1960s, it
                  pulled high volumes of air through a perforated surface into a
                  plenum below. This enabled drying of an aqueous adhesive while
                  maintaining (low) pressure on the painting ([[Hacke 1978]];
                  [[Hacke 1981b]]). The design of these “suction” tables
                  proliferated, allowing for controlled humidification for
                  relaxation and flattening treatments of paintings, both on and
                  off their auxiliary supports. (See [Jim Coddington’s
                  article](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/paper-20)
                  in these proceedings.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  New lining fabrics and new adhesives were also introduced.
                  Mehra used a woven polyester fabric and a thickened acrylic
                  dispersion ([[Mehra 1981]]). Conservators in Europe turned to
                  acrylic dispersions for cold or low heat, nap-bond linings;
                  Alois Diethelm commercialized these adhesives under the mark
                  Lascaux. In the US, conservators turned to heat-seal
                  adhesives: Rabin developed a nap-bond system based on PVA
                  adhesives,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Berger developed Beva 371 based on ethylene vinyl acetate.
                  Fieux developed Fabri-Sil linings, a pressure-sensitive
                  silicone adhesive cured onto Teflon-impregnated fiberglass
                  ([[Fieux 1978]]; [[John G. Shelley Co. 1985]]). (Initially,
                  Fabri-Sil looked like an excellent option, but bonds failed
                  within a few years [[[Shwartzbaum 1993]]; [[Belloli 1993]]].)
                </p>
                <p>
                  To avoid the use of heat or moisture to activate adhesives,
                  solvent activation was studied ([[Phenix and Hedley 1984]];
                  [[Phenix and Hedley 1993]]). Unfortunately, safety issues with
                  electric blowers and pumps prevented us from fully
                  incorporating this into our practice at the time. With the
                  current mist-lining techniques of Jos van Och, we see the
                  resurgence of solvent activation ([[van Och and Hoppenbrouwers
                  2003]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mehra, Hedley, and Villers began systematic studies of
                  available synthetic fabrics and their properties ([[Hedley,
                  Villers, and Mehra 1980]]; [[Hedley, Villers, and Mehra
                  1993]]). They encouraged a manufacturer to produce a wide,
                  heat-set sailcloth without the usual impregnants ([[Hedley and
                  Villers 1982]]). In Canada and the United States,
                  respectively, Roger Roche ([[Roche 1976]]), and Blakney and
                  Sutton introduced industrial monofilament fabrics and stiff
                  filter and belt fabrics ([[Blakney and Sutton 1983]];
                  [[Blakney 1993]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  Methods of stiffening fabrics by using sizing or retaining
                  Mylar on the reverse of linings were explored. Marouflage onto
                  aluminum honeycomb supports was common, and laminates to
                  increase rigidity were explored.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>

                  The Influence of Research by Others
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In 1982, Mecklenburg’s unpublished report “Some Aspects of the
                  Mechanical Behavior of Fabric Supported Paintings: Report to
                  the Smithsonian Institution” circulated widely ([[Mecklenburg
                  1982]]). This had us thinking about how everything fit
                  together; the hygro-thermo-mechanical properties of the
                  individual materials and their contribution to the behavior of
                  the painting as a whole; the influence of the geometry and
                  behavior of the wood stretcher, and the effects of our
                  interventions, such as lining and stretching.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mecklenburg introduced three concepts: first, that the total
                  tension in a painting (the double red arrow running across the
                  painting in [<strong>fig. 19.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-1))
                  was simply the sum of the individual tensions in each layer
                  (the smaller arrows on the far right of
                  <strong>fig. 19.1</strong>). Second, that the response of each
                  layer to changes in relative humidity (RH) was not simply a
                  change in dimension but also a change in elasticity. And
                  third, that “force realignment” (later phrased as stress
                  alignment) could explain many deformations of paintings while
                  under tension, as in <strong>fig. 19.1a</strong>. (Curl, a
                  separate mechanism for cupping, is described by [Hough and
                  Michalski](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/paper-41)
                  in these proceedings.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mecklenburg demonstrated the power of his model by predicting
                  the response of a painting to wide swings in RH; his plot of
                  tension in a sample from a 1912 painting is shown in [<strong>fig. 19.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-2)
                  (1, solid black line). Within a few years, various authors had
                  repeated this measurement, including another sample from
                  Mecklenburg’s 1912 painting, measured by Hedley while at CCI
                  (8, solid green line). Although different authors used
                  different materials and different procedures, the result was a
                  universal “hockey stick” curve, with a minimum somewhere
                  between 65% RH and 95% RH, depending on prior history and the
                  amount of prestrain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This new knowledge informed our decisions; specifically, it
                  influenced our pursuit of better lining supports and
                  improvements in noninterventive options, such as backing
                  boards, enclosed case/frame design, and protection during
                  transit. At that time, conservators and conservation
                  scientists at CCI and other institutions were focusing on
                  noninterventive preventive conservation measures for the broad
                  heritage community, recommending best practices to improve the
                  management of the museum environment and the handling,
                  display, storage, and transit of museum objects. Controlling
                  the physical risks and environment around the painting—with
                  minimal alteration of the painting’s appearance or its
                  materials—was an important option in the conservator’s
                  repertoire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In terms of lining, however, the question was whether the new
                  materials were capable of preventing deformation or fracture
                  of the painting. This question led to the CCI Lining Project,
                  a collaboration between a conservator (Daly Hartin) and a
                  scientist (Stefan Michalski), that lasted over a thirty-year
                  period.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>

                  Humidification and Canvas Shrinkage
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In the first phase of the Lining Project (1980s) we prepared
                  samples with successive layers applied: linen canvas, linen
                  canvas + size, linen canvas + size + oil ground, linen canvas
                  + size + oil ground + oil paint. At the time, we used manual
                  testing equipment to measure the weight, length, and tension
                  of the samples during changes in RH ([[Daly and Michalski
                  1987]]), and it was the conservator who made the measurements
                  ([<strong>fig. 19.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-3)).
                  This intimate tactile and visual engagement of the conservator
                  with the samples as they underwent rapid changes influenced
                  her practice as much as the measurements being collected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In our dimensional response study of 1985–1986 we were
                  surprised to see that samples taken from 47%–71%&nbsp;RH did not
                  stabilize at their peak but began to shrink after only two
                  hours at 71% RH. This was significantly lower than the ~85% RH
                  we had presumed for onset of shrinkage based on tension
                  studies prior to that date. By 1987, however, Hedley’s
                  measurements ([[Hedley 1988]]; [[Hedley 1993]]) in our labs at
                  CCI confirmed that a severe “shrinker,” when significantly
                  prestressed, and before experiencing the permanent relaxation
                  that occurs at 90%&nbsp;RH, could experience onset of shrinkage as
                  early as 65%&nbsp;RH (see [<strong>fig. 19.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-2),
                  double green line [10]). Such potential for shrinkage led to
                  great caution in our use of humidity treatments in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When using humidification tables for relaxation and flattening
                  treatments, it is easy to produce higher humidity conditions
                  than intended, particularly when that is combined with heat,
                  even at low levels. Early monitoring of the Willard
                  Multipurpose Table<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  at CCI showed that even with a moderate setting of 76%&nbsp;RH and
                  duct heating at 30°C, the humidity under the painting can rise
                  to 90%&nbsp;RH and above, due to the temperature difference between
                  the warmer ducts and the cooler table surface. To reduce this
                  risk, the conservator requested a monitoring system for RH
                  under the painting ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]]; [[Daly Hartin
                  et al. 2015b]]). By glancing at the computer display of
                  conditions under an experimental painting—placed to one side
                  of the painting being treated—the conservator could adjust the
                  table settings to maintain safe levels of humidification.

                  The response of the linen + size sample was fast, whether
                  change in weight, dimension, or tension. When exposed to a
                  jump in RH, half the eventual change of length occurred within
                  five to seven minutes, and total change happened within one to
                  two hours. Under the binocular microscope one could literally
                  see the scale attached to the end of each sample moving past
                  the reference point (see [<strong>fig. 19.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-3)).
                  This instilled a deep appreciation of the reactivity of sized
                  canvas, and the consequent importance of backing boards and
                  enclosed frames to reduce RH fluctuations.

                  Controlled humidification is sometimes used to reactivate glue
                  size in paintings, readhering incipient cleavage without
                  adding another adhesive. During one such treatment on the
                  Willard table, areas of missing paint allowed us to observe
                  the glue size bridging canvas interstices. Before
                  humidification, the glue size was fractured; during
                  humidification, the fractures disappeared. The size coalesced
                  into a continuous film that moved under slight pressure from a
                  probe. While that was a desired outcome, the reactivated size
                  layer was once again a source of stresses. As demonstrated in
                  previous research (e.g., [[Mecklenburg 1982]], [[Daly and
                  Michalski 1987]], and [[Hedley 1988]]), the coherent size is
                  reactive to low RH conditions and thereby particularly
                  vulnerable to stretching and shock under these conditions.
                  This understanding further reinforced our emphasis on the
                  passive control of RH by enclosures, that is, the importance
                  of preventive conservation.

                  Bond Strength of the Lining
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In the 1980s and early 1990s, conservators reported bond
                  strengths of the newly introduced fabrics and adhesives using
                  peel tests. In our peel tests we often found it difficult to
                  reproduce results even within our own studies ([[Daly Hartin,
                  Michalski, and Pacquet 1993]]), and inferring comparison
                  between studies or from one lab to another is even more
                  difficult. We concluded that although published results could
                  provide guidance, trial mock-ups of new materials and
                  procedures in one’s own lab are essential. For example, when
                  trying to reproduce the results of solvent activation tests
                  described by Phenix and Hedley ([[Phenix and Hedley 1984]];
                  [[Phenix and Hedley 1993]])—with Gerry Hedley himself present
                  to guide us—we were unable to obtain the acceptable results
                  that he had published. We had to use mock-ups, modifying the
                  procedure by varying the amount of solvent used and allowing
                  time for swelling of the adhesive, to obtain an adequate bond.
                  We learned that peel tests provide guidelines, but they do not
                  necessarily reflect actual practice. Peel tests can inform us
                  which combinations of materials and procedures do not work and
                  which do work or have the potential to work. Trial linings,
                  using test or model paintings and the equipment and procedures
                  in one’s own lab, must be undertaken to refine the method and
                  ensure the resulting lining will be satisfactory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trial or mock-up linings are not only important when new
                  materials or procedures are used, or when there is a change in
                  lab equipment such as purchase or refurbishment of a new hot
                  table, but they have become increasingly important with our
                  design of more customized linings for the specific needs of a
                  particular painting. To allow for repetition or improvement to
                  the trial, or mock-up, lining, there must be careful attention
                  to, and documentation of, all details of the lining materials
                  and procedures. This includes the amount of adhesive used,
                  details of its application to the lining fabric, the method
                  and conditions of adhesive activation (activation temperature,
                  time of heating, time at activation temperature, time of
                  cooling), and the lining pressure.

                  Conservators were aware of the high sensitivity of bond
                  strength to temperature, particularly when attempting to heat
                  a thermoplastic such as Beva 371 until it is tacky while
                  avoiding its nearby melting point. Monitoring the temperature
                  uniformity of hot tables during peel tests heightened our
                  awareness that hot tables were notoriously uneven in heat
                  distribution over the surface. This instigated practical
                  measures to ensure appropriate temperatures over the work
                  area, and multiple-point monitoring of the surface became
                  essential.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A particularly important example of the importance of mock-ups
                  and of monitoring temperature uniformity of hot table surfaces
                  was adapting to the change in Beva 371 film from its original
                  formulation to Beva 371b. In 2010, we were informed by the
                  manufacturer that despite this change, the new product had the
                  same properties.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  Many conservators, however, had found differences in
                  performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Élisabeth Forest, a painting conservator at the Centre de
                  Conservation du Québec, had used peel tests to study Beva 371
                  film while a student ([[Forest 1997]]). She found that 65˚C
                  and a 10-minute holding time gave an acceptable bond.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  This formed the guideline for many successful linings.
                  However, using the new formulation under the same conditions,
                  she found there was a high probability of local detachment
                  during restretching of both linings and strip linings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2018, Forest compared the two formulations in a study
                  undertaken at the Centre de Conservation du Québec ([[Forest
                  2019]]). As in the previous tests, two reactivation
                  temperatures (65°C and 70°C) and two holding times (0 and 10
                  minutes at the activation temperature) were used ([<strong>fig. 19.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-4)).
                  The nap bond strength of both formulations was strongly
                  influenced by temperature, more than doubling in force between
                  65°C and 70°C. Based on what was considered a reliable bond,
                  0.33–0.41&nbsp;kN/m,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  shown by red lines in <strong>fig. 19.4</strong>, only lining
                  at 70°C with a duration of 10 minutes was successful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These results corroborate an earlier study by Ploeger et al.
                  of the two formulations used in solution as a consolidant for
                  painted surfaces ([[Ploeger, McGlinchey, and de la Rie
                  2015]]). The original Beva 371 was shown to have a larger tack
                  window with a gradual increase in tack, while Beva 371b had a
                  narrow tack window with a sudden increase in tack. In summary,
                  if the tack window (of any adhesive) becomes too narrow, or if
                  time at the activation temperature is a determining factor in
                  obtaining an acceptable bond, then temperature uniformity and
                  monitoring become even more critical.

                  Stress Relaxation of Linings and Paintings
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The overall goal of the Lining Project, besides understanding
                  the fundamental mechanics of a painting plus a lining, was to
                  determine whether linings can actually be considered a support
                  for the painting: can they reduce cupping and cracking, or can
                  they only be considered as a bridge for ruptures in brittle
                  and broken canvas?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The primary measurement for answering this question is stress
                  relaxation—the loss in tension of a restrained sample over
                  time. The primary concept within which to place such
                  measurements is that of viscoelasticity in polymers (see also
                  [Hagan](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/paper-2)
                  and [Hough and
                  Michalski](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/paper-41)).
                  Conservators intuit this concept in their use of the terms
                  <em>relaxation</em> and <em>memory</em> of deformations. In
                  the initial research on mechanical properties of paintings,
                  such as the tension versus RH studies in [<strong>fig. 19.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-2),
                  or stress strain plots, authors were not overly concerned with
                  reporting time issues: How fast was the test? How much time
                  had passed since the initial stretch? Tension, and its
                  underlying parameter elasticity, depend on time, not just
                  temperature and RH.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By 1991, we were placing our review of published data on the
                  mechanics of paints within the framework of polymer
                  viscoelasticity. Specifically, we introduced the primary tool
                  of that framework—the “master curve”—which plotted elasticity
                  over the full range of a polymer’s behavior, from glassy
                  through leathery to rubbery as a function of temperature,
                  plasticizer, and time ([[Michalski 1991]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  To understand whether a lining will actually support the
                  painting, and by how much, analysis of results focused on
                  whether the lining is at higher tension than the painting
                  during stretching, during shock and vibration, and during
                  fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature—and on
                  whether the lining can maintain this support over many years.
                  Sample preparation and experimental procedures have been
                  published elsewhere ([[Michalski and Daly Hartin 1996]];
                  [[Daly Hartin et al. 2010]]; [[Daly Hartin et al. 2011]];
                  [[Michalski et al. 2014]]; [[Daly Hartin et al. 2015a]]). The
                  2015 article also summarizes the results of the project and
                  their implications for linings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tension was measured continuously over time. If the sample is
                  undergoing stress relaxation, then the tension drops over
                  time, as shown by all curves in [<strong>fig. 19.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-5).
                  The process of building these master curves that extend to
                  very short and very long times is described by
                  [Hagan](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/paper-2)

                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The big takeaway from <strong>fig. 19.5</strong> is that one
                    group of linings had curves that differed only slightly from
                    the red curve for the unlined painting, whereas a second
                    group lifted the curve significantly. The first group,
                    nap-bond Beva linings onto linen and onto multifilament,
                    non-heat-set polyester, represents linings providing
                    negligible tension/support (see [<strong>fig. 19.1a</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-1)).
                    The second group—sailcloth + Beva and linen + wax—represents
                    linings that add significant tension/support (see
                    <strong>fig. 19.1b</strong>). Wax impregnation changes both
                    the linen lining and the original canvas into a significant
                    reinforced composite, quite unlike linen adhered simply with
                    Beva. However, even though the linen + wax lining initially
                    contributes more support (additional tension) than the
                    sailcloth + Beva lining, at around one second, it starts to
                    quickly lose tension, and at one day it is providing less
                    support than the sailcloth + Beva lining.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The question of whether these stiffer linings provide enough
                  support to reduce defects in a painting is examined in
                  [<strong>fig. 19.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-6).
                  What percentage of the total tension is the lining alone
                  contributing to the lined composite? In the region of transit
                  shock, whether at room temperature or low temperature, linen +
                  wax has double the contribution of sailcloth + Beva, but both
                  linings offer some support, thus cracking may be reduced. For
                  slightly slower events, such as initial stretching or keying
                  out, both linings gain in percentage, offering slightly more
                  support. As days and years pass at room temperature, the
                  contribution of linen + wax collapses. The supportive
                  contribution of sailcloth + Beva continues to increase, but
                  never enough to dominate tension (see [<strong>fig. 19.1b</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-1)).
                  To dominate tension, to reduce defects in the painting, the
                  lining (not the painting) must contribute over 50% of the
                  tension. Although sailcloth + Beva is relatively better in the
                  long term, neither sailcloth + Beva nor a linen + wax lining
                  truly dominates tension; neither does much better than reach
                  half of the total tension.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The influence of the lining in reducing cupping was studied
                  using a set of square samples prepared with a T-shape cut in
                  the center of the model painting prior to a nap-bond Beva
                  lining ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2015a]]). After eighteen years,
                  the model painting lined with Beva onto a rigid aluminum plate
                  showed no cupping as depicted in [<strong>fig. 19.1b</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-1).
                  The cupping along the “tear” of the sailcloth lining could be
                  described as minimal to none; the sailcloth lining did not
                  prevent cupping along the tear as well as the rigid aluminum,
                  but it performed much better than the loosely woven linen and
                  polyester linings which appeared as [<strong>fig. 19.1a</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-1).
                  This is consistent with sailcloth’s performance over days and
                  years ([<strong>fig. 19.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-6)).

                  We measured the response of samples to RH fluctuations up to
                  70%&nbsp;RH to give comparative data on the ability of the lining
                  to support the stress in a painting during daily humidity
                  cycles ([[Daly Hartin et al. 2015a]]). Some of these data are
                  shown elsewhere in these proceedings ([fig.
                  2.4](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-2-4)
                  in [Hagan’s
                  paper](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/paper-2)).
                  The sailcloth + Beva lining, unaffected by RH, provides a
                  constant absolute level of support during RH fluctuations, but
                  during periods of very low RH (20%), rising tension in the oil
                  painting overwhelms that of the sailcloth + Beva (i.e., the
                  system goes from [<strong>fig. 19.1b</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-1)
                  to <strong>fig. 19.1a</strong>). Linen + wax is very
                  different; it completely blocks response to one hour of
                  70%&nbsp;RH, and blocks response to a 12-hour exposure by
                  two-thirds. (It is not our intent to promote wax linings, but
                  to understand them as historic treatments with advantages as
                  well as known disadvantages.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  This ability of wax linings to reduce sensitivity to short RH
                  fluctuations (1–12 hours) must be placed alongside the
                  increased sensitivity to longer RH fluctuations shown by
                  Andersen and colleagues ([[Andersen et al. 2014]]). They
                  showed that a restrained sample of an old wax-lined painting
                  that had not yet been exposed to the permanent relaxation that
                  occurs at 90%&nbsp;RH ([<strong>fig. 19.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-2),
                  double brown line [12]) increased dramatically in tension at
                  RH above ~60% when exposed for at least 18 hours. Whereas our
                  short-term data showed the moisture barrier effects of wax
                  linings, Andersen’s data showed the transformation of the
                  canvas from porous yarns, which need to swell a lot before
                  they tighten the textile, into a composite of fibers embedded
                  in a wax matrix that tightens as soon as any fiber swelling
                  occurs. The longer exposure permitted this to happen.
                  Andersen’s 18-hour exposures also showed a second phenomenon:
                  in the second cycle, after the exposure to 90%&nbsp;RH ([<strong>fig. 19.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-2),
                  dashed double brown line [13]), the V-shape response seen in
                  the graph reverted to more of a hockey stick shape. Something
                  was transformed irreversibly in the canvas by a single
                  exposure to high RH while restrained.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can see a similar but slightly less pronounced example of
                  these two phenomena in a painting that was not wax lined: the
                  Walker 1868–69 painting ([<strong>fig. 19.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/19-Daly%20Hartin/Daly%20Hartin/fig-19-2);
                  compare 10, before exposure to 90%&nbsp;RH, to 11, after exposure
                  to 90%&nbsp;RH). In both cases, when a canvas is impregnated with a
                  liquid that solidifies, whether wax or size, it becomes a
                  composite of fibers in a matrix. If the size, wax, or any
                  adhesive just sits on top, we have instead a laminate. In
                  practice, in a painting, one probably has a hybrid. The
                  increase in tension (due to fiber swelling and crimp) of a
                  restrained textile as RH climbs will occur at lower RH if
                  those fibers are locked within a matrix. But if the tension in
                  this composite gets high enough, for long enough, a
                  viscoelastic matrix will irreversibly slip, slide, and even
                  exude, leading to a change in subsequent behavior.
                </p>
                <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  Of the different types of linings we tested, though some offer
                  more support than others, all share the load with the stiff
                  layers of the painting. A support with mechanical properties
                  similar to the heat-set sailcloth may reduce defects in
                  certain situations: cupping over the years, and cracking in
                  ground and paint from initial stretching, keying out, shock
                  and vibration, and cold temperatures. However, sailcloth will
                  not totally eliminate defects. The best choice combines a
                  sailcloth lining, or its mechanical equivalent, with passive
                  RH control. Loosely woven multifilament fabric supports will
                  bridge ruptured layers—but alone, will not reduce cupping and
                  cracking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Linings have decreased over the last twenty years due to the
                  desire for less intervention with the painting and due to the
                  development of effective, noninterventive options that provide
                  support and protection. Where linings are necessary, research
                  on the mechanical behavior of lined paintings has informed us
                  of the limitations and benefits of the materials available to
                  us, allowing us to assess and select the best option
                  available. Our research has shown us that to prevent defects
                  in a painting, we are forced to integrate lining choices with
                  preventive conservation choices—specifically, the use of
                  passive RH control strategies, such as backing boards and
                  tight enclosures, which fortunately coincide with efforts to
                  develop more sustainable solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Research over the past forty years, by CCI and others, has
                  provided us with the knowledge to assess and refine our
                  practices, such as relaxation, flattening, and lining, so they
                  are undertaken with greater effectiveness combined with less
                  intervention and less risk to paintings. Though institutions
                  with more control over their environments and painting
                  enclosures can avoid lining in many instances, there are
                  situations, such as extensive damage or instability and little
                  control over the painting’s environment, when lining is
                  necessary. As a result of our studies, sailcloth has been
                  considered and used as a lining support, though it does have
                  practical difficulties such as its inauthentic appearance and
                  problems along the tacking margin fold. We just do not have
                  the perfect option, but we are more aware of what a lining can
                  and cannot do.

                  Our profession is in the position to observe the impact and
                  effects of treatments undertaken in the past decades and to
                  develop even better solutions with the knowledge, materials,
                  and tools available to us today. We are fortunate that our
                  field encourages and enables conservators and conservation
                  scientists to work together to address the technical issues
                  and observations arising in the conservation lab. This
                  collaboration and direct involvement in practical research
                  promotes appropriate, practical, knowledge-based solutions.

                  ’80s. Vocal dissatisfaction with the aesthetic results of many
                  linings had grown in the years before this, resulting in
                  numerous designs for suction tables that were more versatile
                  and controllable for conservators undertaking structural
                  treatments of paintings. The principal versions of these
                  tables came to be known by the names of the conservators who
                  designed them–Mehra, Hacke, and Willard. These tables, while
                  similar in many ways, each had unique features that
                  incorporated the designer’s theory of lining and more
                  generally structural treatments.

                <p>
                  The history of the suction table, as history, is an
                  interesting story of ideas sometimes driving technology and at
                  other times technology driving ideas. However, it is
                  reasonable to say that the technologies and designs of the
                  tables that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s are
                  remarkably similar, with the driving rationale of the designer
                  being probably the most critical difference between any of the
                  tables. Indeed, these suction tables are routinely referred to
                  by the name of the principal or co-principal designer. The
                  tables this paper focuses on are those designed by Mehra,
                  Hacke, and Willard. Each emerged at the time of, or shortly
                  after, the Greenwich lining conference, with the Willard table
                  becoming the design most widely distributed over the years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The stated goals and final designs of each provide useful
                  insight into how the mechanics of paintings were understood at
                  the time of design. They also provide some understanding of
                  our aesthetic criteria for paintings then—and how much (or
                  even little) each of these differs from our understanding and
                  thinking today. Finally, these designs also illustrate how
                  knowledge gained in the conservation studio—craft knowledge—is
                  often later articulated in the scientific laboratory,
                  affording greater refinement to those studio practices.

                  Mehra’s Design
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Vishwa Mehra, who had been working at the Central Research
                  Laboratory in Amsterdam since 1966, began his public
                  discussion of lining treatments at the 1972 ICOM meeting in
                  Madrid. There, he examined the prevailing orthodoxy of lining
                  and posited a set of new criteria for structural restoration.
                  His observations and evaluation of the functional and
                  aesthetic shortcomings of glue linings and wax-resin linings
                  are familiar, and questions of reversibility; weave
                  interference; stability of treatment materials; and visual
                  alteration of fabric, ground, and paint were particularly
                  critical ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He also suggested that leaving visible traces of a painting’s
                  age, such as some cupping and cracking, was viable, as opposed
                  to trying to make them disappear as completely as possible
                  ([[Ackroyd 2002|, 4]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Mehra’s critique led him to conclude that structural problems
                  should be understood through more systematic analysis and more
                  precise treatment—or a series of treatments—rather than
                  through a single global treatment like overall consolidation
                  or lining. The first need then, was to determine with greater
                  accuracy the actual strength of the materials in a painting
                  composite, which would then allow the conservator to tailor
                  treatments to individual paintings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mehra’s ideas had been in the air for some time by then.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  A reading of the ICOM replies to the lining questionnaire
                  distributed in 1972 and published in 1975 offers some
                  revealing insights into concerns that practitioners had for
                  both glue and wax-resin linings ([[Rees Jones, Cummings, and
                  Hedley 1975]]). Wax-resin lining had been the subject of some
                  considerable research and development in Britain, resulting in
                  1948 in the construction of what is deemed the first hot
                  table. In 1955, this mechanization of lining (and
                  consolidation, of which much will be made later) was furthered
                  by the introduction of vacuum to the hot table ([[Hackney
                  2020|, 84]]). By 1960, it was noted in an ICOM report that
                  many paintings fared poorly under such treatments. With this
                  background in mind, Mehra had, by 1972, set down what might be
                  called his first principles, of which there are eight,
                  summarized here ([[Mehra 1972]]):
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>Full reversibility.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      No alteration of the structural character of the painting.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Select materials for the specific problems of the actual
                      painting.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Flexibility.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Avoid or minimize heat.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Minimal weight increase after lining.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Non-penetrating lining adhesive (note similarity to item
                      2).
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Adhesives should be stable with RH and have variable
                      strength and application properties.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  He then went on to specify that the materials used for
                  structural restoration should be synthetic in order to fulfill
                  stability and reversibility criteria. Putting all of this
                  together was, in Mehra’s thinking, a fundamentally new
                  approach, outside the glue and wax-lining traditions. The
                  practical application of this theoretical position required
                  the separation of consolidation from lining. In this way, it
                  was possible to meet criteria of lightness and to also select
                  materials appropriate to the mechanical and aesthetic
                  properties of the painting under treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Considering the question of consolidation, Mehra established
                  the following criteria for a successful consolidant ([[Mehra
                  1972]]):
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Light in weight but having good cohesion.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Solvent will not swell paint layer.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Internally plasticized.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Colorless and resistant to temperature and RH changes.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Compatible with the painting structure.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The consolidants he chose were Plexisol and Bedacryl, which he
                  then ultimately coupled with Plextol as a cold-lining
                  adhesive. By using these consolidants, Mehra found he could
                  achieve adequate consolidation results with less adhesive and
                  could then use relatively lightweight fabrics when lining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The use of these aqueous materials, as well as the need to
                  minimize lining defects such as weave interference and moating
                  (that is, no alteration of the structural character of the
                  painting), dictated the development of a suction table, and in
                  1975, Mehra published the design of a table to dry the
                  painting under controllable low pressure. The function of the
                  table is predicated upon high airflow capabilities, and thus
                  required a significant plenum, which is covered by a
                  perforated sheet of metal. The airflow is controlled by
                  varying both the blower speed and by opening and closing the
                  bleeder vents at one end of the table. The table thus has
                  directional flow, the air being brought in one end of the
                  table and out the other. On the surface of the perforated
                  sheet is an open cell polyurethane sheet that can conform to
                  the topography of the rear of the painting, although not too
                  readily ([<strong>fig. 20.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/20-Coddington/fig-20-1)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ultimately, Mehra developed a three-stretcher system for use
                  on the table when lining. The first stretcher, significantly
                  larger than the painting, has the lining fabric attached to
                  it. The reason for this oversize lining fabric is Mehra’s
                  estimation that the center of a stretched fabric has fewer
                  asymmetric strains than the edges, so the extra lining fabric
                  minimizes introduction of new stress patterns on the painting
                  after lining. The second stretcher has a screen stretched on
                  it, with the sight size of the painting marked off. Through
                  this screen, the adhesive is squeegeed onto the lining canvas,
                  and then the screen is lifted, leaving on the lining fabric a
                  measured dose of adhesive. The amount of adhesive can be
                  varied by using different types of screens (fine to coarse).
                  The painting, previously strip-lined onto the third stretcher,
                  is carefully placed onto the adhesive, and the painting is
                  then dried on the suction table. The presence of a membrane
                  during drying would be optional. The strip-lining would later
                  be removed if it had adhered on top of the tacking edge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It should be noted that at certain points in the development
                  of this system Mehra was relying on the moisture in the
                  adhesive to help relax the painting—as one coming from a
                  background in glue-lining might well do. Over time, he moved
                  more toward pretreating these distortions and toward using
                  less and less adhesive for lining. Mehra was nothing if not
                  relentlessly logical in the development of each step of his
                  process; thus, it is not inconceivable that another motive for
                  his ultimately incorporating Saran beads into the lining
                  adhesive was as a means of lowering the adhesive strength to
                  the level of a nap bond.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The advent of technological advancements such as the Mehra
                  table led others to develop yet other new procedures, and to
                  also refine the lining adhesive strength problem. At the
                  Courtauld Institute, Gerry Hedley, Alan Phenix, and Vicky
                  Leanse investigated the use of solvent activation of a variety
                  of synthetic adhesives ([<strong>fig. 20.2</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/20-Coddington/fig-20-2)).
                  Such approaches further refined the process, raising the
                  possibility of further controlling lining adhesive strength
                  via control of solvent dosage prior to lining ([[Phenix and
                  Hedley 1984]]).

                <h2 id="hacke%E2%80%99s-design" tabindex="-1">
                  Hacke’s Design
                </h2>
                <p>
                  As mentioned earlier, Mehra regarded his approach to the
                  lining and structural treatment of paintings as a fundamental
                  departure from the tradition of glue and wax-resin linings.
                  Similar technology was being developed at roughly the same
                  time by Bent Hacke, who at the 1981 ICOM meeting noted that
                  his goal was to “construct an instrument based on the
                  tradition of our profession” ([[Hacke 1981a]]). More
                  specifically, his was an effort to call attention to the
                  practical and useful elements of glue-lining while still being
                  aware of the potential problems. This is fundamental to the
                  discussion of the next two tables—Hacke and Willard—because
                  both were developed with an eye toward mechanizing or adapting
                  the glue-lining tradition—quite explicitly so in the case of
                  the Willard table.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hacke published his first paper on “untraditional” lining, as
                  he called it, in 1964. By the 1978 ICOM meeting many of his
                  table’s essential features were already in place ([[Hacke
                  1978]]). His system evolved to incorporate four principal
                  features— heat, moisture, tension, and pressure—the
                  manipulation of which Hacke once described as “like playing my
                  piano.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  By varying these factors during treatment, he was also able to
                  arrive at the goal of tailoring the treatment procedure to the
                  painting’s needs. Like Mehra, Hacke found that as he focused
                  on pretreatment he could use less adhesive for lining. Note
                  that, however, Hacke, although he preferred synthetics for
                  their durability, did not wholly reject natural fabrics and
                  adhesives as Mehra did. Similarly, the use of heat was not
                  eschewed but rather incorporated to facilitate plasticization
                  of the paint film. Ethylene glycol mixed with water was
                  occasionally used for the same purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The structure of Hacke’s table is a plenum with an eggcrate
                  structure inside, through which heating elements pass
                  ([<strong>fig. 20.3</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/20-Coddington/fig-20-3)).
                  Air is removed from the plenum to create low pressure beneath
                  the painting, and this air is moved via headers along the edge
                  of the table. On top of the eggcrate structure is an aluminum
                  sheet with fairly large holes. Atop this is placed a moist
                  blanket for the humidifying part of the treatment, and then
                  onto that is placed a fine-holed screen that will hold the
                  loomed painting. Ultimately, the wet blanket is replaced by a
                  humidifier that introduces humid air beneath the painting via
                  the plenum during the pretreatment stage. As with the Mehra
                  process, before lining—or even as a substitute for
                  lining—pretreatment of distortion, cupping, and flaking is
                  done, all facilitated by the suction table to humidify and/or
                  pull consolidant into the paint film ([<strong>fig. 20.4</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/20-Coddington/fig-20-4)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  When overall consolidation was necessary, a consolidant like
                  Plexisol was used. For lining, Plextol was used, principally
                  for its low-temperature heat activation. The strength of the
                  lining adhesive could be varied by the number of coats of
                  adhesive applied: typically, one or two coats, which were
                  allowed to dry overnight. In contrast to Mehra’s system,
                  Hacke’s is not purely a cold-lining method.

                  Willard’s Design
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Similar to Bent Hacke, Tony Reeve saw a need to standardize or
                  mechanize the process of glue-lining, and from this the
                  Willard table developed ([[Reeve 1984]]). This table is rather
                  more explicitly a table designed to execute—and more
                  importantly control—glue-linings. As glue-linings rely greatly
                  on the skill of the liner and the liner’s experience, many of
                  the features of the Willard table integrate controls that rely
                  on such knowledge to bring the table to full operation. The
                  heating is not too different from the Hacke table, although
                  the flow is considerably more complicated. The idea of
                  humidifying from the rear is the same and is also mechanized,
                  as Hacke’s table ultimately was. Hacke rather dryly noted that
                  “it proves to be very complicated to work out a system which
                  makes it possible to blow in moist air which can be
                  accumulated in the structure of the painting.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  The mechanization of humidification through the ducting of a
                  suction table is indeed a technically difficult proposition,
                  and therefore a lot of controls are built into the Willard
                  table. The potential for damage by too much moisture is well
                  known to glue liners and thus the system incorporates a
                  dehumidifier as well. Early versions of the Willard table were
                  tested quite rigorously at the National Gallery, London, and
                  at Tate, with extensive modification of the initial design to
                  accommodate a number of difficulties encountered, such as
                  condensation in the ducting and on the surface of the table
                  ([[Reeve, Ackroyd, and Stephenson-Wright 1988]]) ([<strong>fig. 20.5</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/20-Coddington/fig-20-5)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the critical features of this design is the two
                  independent flow patterns. One set of channels introduces the
                  conditioned air to the backside of the painting or,
                  theoretically, up into a closed chamber; the other flow system
                  holds the painting flat on the table. As with the Hacke table,
                  there are removable aluminum sheets. This table has since been
                  produced commercially and is widely distributed.

                <p>
                  It is significant that without a glue-lining tradition to rely
                  on, but with rather more experience using synthetic adhesives
                  for lining and consolidation, the United States lagged behind
                  in the development of suction tables devoted to both
                  mechanizing plasticization of the paint film and lining
                  paintings. Ultimately, research developments informed these
                  efforts more than did an adaptation of long-standing
                  traditions. It is difficult to overstate how critical Marion
                  Mecklenburg’s research on the mechanical properties of the
                  materials in a painting were to these and many other advances
                  in structural treatments both in the US and Europe.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  It is then not surprising to see how similar key elements of
                  suction table design were, whether they emerged from older
                  traditions or from laboratory research—illustrating once again
                  how basic research converges on established practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the first US suction tables for paintings was the
                  Versi-Vac tabletop device, developed by Albert Albano and Bill
                  Maxwell ([[Albano 1984]]). Fundamental to the design of this
                  was the idea to use the existing base of hot tables as a heat
                  source, but to use suction instead of vacuum as a pressure
                  source. In addition, an inflatable dome would be used to
                  control the environment around the painting, thereby putting
                  into practice Mecklenburg’s work on optimal humidification
                  levels to plasticize paint films ([[Colville, Kilpatrick, and
                  Mecklenburg 1982]]). The principal drawback to this table
                  design is that as, a tabletop device, the plenum is
                  shallow—basically the depth of the two wire screens attached
                  to the frame, thus limiting the rate of flow beneath the
                  painting and making the system incapable of some treatments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The question of efficient airflow in suction tables was an
                  area of investigation that has been most fully addressed by
                  Stefan Michalski in a number of papers that are both
                  theoretically and practically focused (see, e.g., [[Michalski
                  1984]]). Of particular note are the textile suction tables he
                  demonstrated during the early 1980s and several papers on the
                  theory of how suction tables work. Michalski drew out the
                  critical points of the power of capillarity in moving moisture
                  in and out of paper (or more generically cellulosics), the
                  relationship of airflow and pressure curves in suction pump
                  specification, the concept of creating low pressure beneath an
                  object to thereby create downward pressure on it from above,
                  and the use of alternate flow channels to minimize drying
                  fronts when drying textiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This latter point makes an important distinction between such
                  a flow design and that of Mehra’s table design, which had a
                  unidirectional laminar flow. By making the airflow a series of
                  short paths across the entire surface, as Michalski did, the
                  drying capability of the table is enhanced; each of the many
                  short air paths avoids becoming saturated. Notably, this kind
                  of flow pattern is also incorporated into the Willard table
                  discussed above. If in addition a screen is present on top of
                  the channels, the air will be made more turbulent, and this
                  will further enhance drying efficiency. Such a flow pattern
                  also allows drying of a painting or textile from underneath,
                  thus allowing membranes to be used during drying and letting
                  the practitioner maintain a desired level of planarity for the
                  object throughout the drying process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course, unless something is wet one doesn’t really need to
                  concern oneself with how to get it dry (on a suction table or
                  otherwise). Mecklenburg’s fundamental work on the influence of
                  moisture on the strength and stiffness of canvas, sizing, and
                  paint is basic to understanding—and subsequently
                  mechanizing—the humidification process ([[Mecklenburg
                  1982]])—basic because it begins to quantify the plasticization
                  of paint and identifies mechanisms by which moisture can be
                  dangerous and is thus richly suggestive of how to design
                  effective structural treatments with or without lining.
                  Specifically, Mecklenburg’s research demonstrated that at high
                  relative humidity, damage occurs because the canvas shrinks,
                  and at the same time the glue size and paint have become so
                  low in stiffness that they cannot resist the movement of the
                  canvas. He also demonstrated that pigments have a profound
                  effect on the uptake of moisture by a paint film, and that at
                  low relative humidities the glue size layer is capable of
                  generating stresses in the paint film that could lead to
                  failure (cracking). The implications for the treatment of
                  paintings—and for controlling that treatment—are enormous.

                <p>
                  Humidifying paintings to aid in the plasticization of the
                  paint film, whether using damp blankets or blotters or via the
                  water in a glue-paste adhesive, was of course a
                  well-established practice prior to the basic research cited
                  above. Both practice and tradition made clear the need to
                  control the amount of moisture introduced into the composite
                  structure of a painting. A mechanized system of humidification
                  would thus seek to maintain a level of RH that will give the
                  conservator confidence that plastic changes are occurring only
                  in desired layers of the painting—the size and paint
                  film—while not exceeding dangerous levels of moisture in the
                  canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All of this theoretical background was fundamental to the
                  design of the final table I will discuss, one of which was
                  built for New York’s Museum of Modern Art by Bill Maxwell. The
                  table design was initiated by Al Albano and sought to also
                  address the specific needs of MoMA, specifically that the
                  table should be fungible: effective for both paper and
                  paintings conservation. Indeed, as Caroline Villers notes in
                  reviewing the state of affairs at the time of the Greenwich
                  Lining Conference, “The practical problems posed by
                  contemporary paintings were an important driver for change”
                  ([[Villers 2003a]]). The nature of MoMA’s collection—which
                  includes many large works, composite works, and essentially
                  raw canvas works—dictated that the table would be large, with
                  a high airflow for the “textile” problems but sufficiently
                  flexible to treat local distortions or flaking or to even do
                  straight hot table linings for “traditional” paintings. To
                  achieve all this, the experience and ideas of a number of
                  people, including Stefan Michalski and Gerry Hedley, were
                  consulted on the design.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The base of the 8 x 12 ft (2.4 x 3.7m) working surface is
                  basically an aluminum-top hot table with heaters attached
                  underneath and double heaters at the sides to minimize any
                  edge heating gradient. On top of this are 1-inch square
                  aluminum channels, which run the length of the table and have
                  holes drilled in the top at regular intervals. These channels
                  are alternate intake and exhaust channels with an intake
                  header at one end and exhaust at the other, where four 100&nbsp;CFM
                  fans run in parallel. On top of the channels is an aluminum
                  heat exchanger, which is effective at distributing the airflow
                  from the channels to the top surface (a perforated aluminum
                  sheet) while also aiding in transfer of heat to the table
                  surface ([<strong>fig. 20.6</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/20-Coddington/fig-20-6)).
                  Pressure and flow are controlled by leakage, a rheostat that
                  varies the voltage to the pumps, an intake valve at the intake
                  header end of the table. By opening an additional valve this
                  intake air can also be passed through an auxiliary heater, and
                  this provides an effective means of minimizing loss of the
                  heat conducted up through the layers to the airflow layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The flow pattern is thus a sweeping of air up from underneath
                  (if the intake valve is open) and the pulling of air down from
                  above. It is this movement of air from underneath which allows
                  for drying under a membrane; it also increases the efficiency
                  of heat transfer from the heating plate. Pressure, of course,
                  will depend on how much air is introduced via the intake
                  valve, as well as the porosity of the support, whether it is
                  canvas or paper, the density of the paint film, and other
                  variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Humidification is done inside a chamber that attaches to the
                  table proper, with a steam humidifier as the moisture source.
                  The humidity is introduced through the tent support poles,
                  which are inserted into ducting that runs around the edges of
                  the table and is fed by the steam humidifier. Clearly, the use
                  of a moist felt or blotter beneath the object is also
                  feasible. The rationale for this method of humidification from
                  above is dictated by Mecklenburg’s research, which
                  demonstrates that (1) the canvas is the point at which
                  significant damage can occur (due to canvas shrinkage) if too
                  much moisture is present, and (2) that the paint film and/or
                  glue size are the sources of stresses that lead to cracking,
                  flaking of the paint, and general distortions. Thus, it was
                  deemed in this table design that it was unnecessarily
                  hazardous to introduce moisture through the canvas if the
                  primary goal was to use the moisture to plasticize the paint
                  film. To humidify a painting, a tent is built on the table,
                  using predrilled holes at the corners for inserting the
                  supports. Humidity is measured by a dew-point sensor located
                  in the tent, which then maintains an RH set point by switching
                  the steam humidifier on and off. The tent has openings on all
                  four sides, which are tabbed with Velcro to facilitate working
                  on the painting during humidification.

                  This paper has outlined the basic features of the early
                  generation of suction tables for the treatment of paintings,
                  along with a discussion of the context of each design. This
                  history reveals the similarities of the designs yet also
                  pinpoints the differences between them in how they articulate
                  the role of tradition within innovation. Additionally, it
                  provides a broader perspective on how knowledge is gained in
                  conservation through the development of studio practices and
                  its associated craft knowledge. These, while empirically
                  derived, reveal highly sophisticated understanding of
                  materials that is later articulated through scientific
                  research.

                  In this paper, Vishwa Mehra’s eight requirements for
                  linings—as written in a report from 1972—are reviewed in a
                  contemporary context nearly fifty years later. Special
                  emphasis is placed on concepts like flexibility,
                  compatibility, and physical integrity, which are still part of
                  conservation discussions. Some of the concepts discussed by
                  Mehra did not have a clear definition, or his understanding of
                  them was either not given or it differed from a more
                  contemporary understanding. This means that his concepts can
                  be used for many different purposes and to justify many
                  different actions. Requirements in conservation were perhaps
                  necessary at a time when the profession was undergoing
                  significant change, but now requirements are generally
                  replaced with recommendations, guidelines, or analysis of the
                  risks involved in a considered action. A way of looking at
                  risk analyses for structural painting conservation is proposed
                  as a way forward for assessing these treatments.

                  The aim of this paper is to revisit and evaluate some early
                  requirements for linings of canvas paintings proposed by
                  Vishwa Mehra ([[Mehra 1972]]) and review them in a
                  contemporary context. The requirements have been very
                  influential within the field of conservation. They were used
                  as guidelines for working conservators and teachers in
                  structural conservation (see [Mikkel Scharff’s
                  paper](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/paper-3)
                  in this publication), and the recommendations have been
                  referenced in normative discussions about conservation praxis.
                  Mehra’s ideas inspired a whole generation of conservators and
                  influenced best practice considerations in structural
                  conservation of canvas paintings for decades ([[Beltinger
                  1995]]; [[Hackney et al. 2012]]; [[Phenix 1995]]; [[van Och
                  and Hoppenbrouwers 2003]]).

                  Vishwa Mehra is an Indian conservator of paintings and an art
                  historian born in 1931. He studied conservation in India,
                  Yugoslavia, and Rome and worked in Israel before he acquired a
                  position at the Central Research Laboratory for Objects of Art
                  and Science in Amsterdam.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through the 1960s there was an increased effort to strengthen
                  and professionalize the field of conservation of cultural
                  heritage. The first ethnical guidelines for conservators, the
                  Murray Pease report, were written for IIC-American group
                  (later the American Institute for Conservation [AIC]) in 1963
                  ([[Pease 1964]]), and in 1964 the Venice charter expanded on
                  these thoughts (charter and introduction can be found in
                  [[Jokilehto 1998]]). The founding of ICOMOS (International
                  Council of Monuments and Sites) in 1965, of ICOM-CC in 1967,
                  and the 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention are also key
                  events in the effort to protect cultural heritage, in light of
                  which Mehra’s paper should be seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One event that also had enormous influence on this development
                  was the catastrophic flooding of Florence on November 4, 1966.
                  It became a milestone in the history of conservation for many
                  reasons, one of them being that the need for education and
                  conservation norms became evident as a result ([[Federspiel
                  2015]]). At the second plenary ICOM-CC meeting in Amsterdam,
                  the Italian conservator Giovanni Urbani called for a more
                  systematic and rational approach to lining canvas paintings
                  ([[Urbani 1969]]). In 1972, Mehra presented his eight
                  requirements for linings in an interim report for the ICOM-CC
                  meeting in Madrid on behalf of Central Research Laboratory for
                  Objects of Art and Science, Amsterdam, “Comparative Study of
                  Conventional Relining Methods and Materials and Research
                  towards Their Improvement” ([[Mehra 1972]]). In this report,
                  Mehra discussed concepts that to this day remain essential to
                  conservation. Some concepts were relevant for the general
                  field of conservation-restoration, such as structural
                  integrity of objects, reversibility, and compatibility of
                  treatments. Other concepts in Mehra’s paper, including
                  flexibility/stiffness, hygroscopicity, and permittivity, were
                  especially important for lining paintings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mehra argued that traditional lining techniques using glue
                  paste and wax resin were too invasive and nonreversible, as
                  they caused the whole painting structure to become embedded in
                  adhesive. Furthermore, he warned against the use of heat in
                  linings, the forces exerted by retensioning a painting, and
                  the extra weight of a wax-resin lining.

                  The Eight Requirements and the Intentions Behind Them
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In his paper Mehra, proposed eight basic requirements for
                  linings. [<strong>Table 21.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/table-21-1)
                  lists the requirements as they were formulated in the report
                  fifty years ago. The questions that drive this paper are
                  whether they are still useful and what they can tell us about
                  our present attitude to structural treatment of canvas
                  paintings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This paper was presented at the 2019 Conserving Canvas
                  Symposium held at the Institute for the Preservation of
                  Cultural Heritage at Yale University.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  The symposium title, Conserving Canvas, echoes the core of the
                  discussions around Mehra’s paper. Mehra, in the Netherlands,
                  and Bent Hacke ([[Hacke 1963]]), in Denmark, became advocates
                  for treatment strategies that were designed treat one problem
                  at a time rather than the complete range of problems in a
                  painting at once. Problems related to the canvas were now seen
                  as a separate part of the canvas painting, and the treatments
                  proposed (nap bond in The Netherlands and lamination in
                  Denmark) were designed to deal with this layer. The ideas
                  behind this concept of separation were presented in Mehra’s
                  paper ([[Mehra 1972]]), where he warned against the long-held
                  tradition of linings impregnating the structure. In this paper
                  the specific requirements written by Mehra are discussed in a
                  contemporary context.
                </p>
                <h3 id="reversibility" tabindex="-1">Reversibility</h3>
                <p>
                  The first requirement is that the materials used should remain
                  fully reversible ([<strong>table 21.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/table-21-1)).
                  According to Applebaum, the “principle of reversibility” was
                  written into the AIC code of ethics and it was advised that
                  the conservator “should avoid the use of materials which may
                  become so intractable that their future removal could endanger
                  the physical safety of the object. He also should avoid the
                  use of techniques the results of which cannot be un-done if
                  that should become desirable” ([[Applebaum 1987]]). However,
                  fully reversible treatments are rarely possible, and the
                  concept has been subject to much discussion. Muñoz Viñas has
                  argued that the greater the reversibility the less the
                  conservator’s responsibility ([[Muñoz Viñas 2005]]). Concepts
                  like removability and retreatability ([[Applebaum 1987]];
                  [[Charteris 1999]]) have been suggested as alternatives, but
                  these still require an understanding of issues like surface
                  tension, penetration, solubility with age, and peel
                  strength—all topics that are still not properly investigated
                  with respect to lining techniques. Despite the debates around
                  the concept, reversibility is still written into the E.C.C.O.
                  Professional Guidelines, in article IX of the Code of Ethics
                  ([[E.C.C.O. 2003]]).

                  Changing the Structure
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The second requirement ([<strong>table 21.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/table-21-1))
                  is that lining, or relining, as Mehra called it ([[Andersen
                  2012]]), may not in any way cause alterations to the
                  structural character of a painting. Although it is not
                  completely clear what he means by “the structural character,”
                  it is known that he wanted to avoid heat and high pressure,
                  which may change the shape of the paint. He therefore
                  described the nap-bond treatment that targeted the needs of
                  the canvas specifically.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The reality, now and then, is probably that most active
                  treatments change the structure slightly, but some changes are
                  more invasive than others and some create more potential for
                  future damage than others. The traditional adhesives for
                  lining, glue paste and wax resin, were intended to penetrate
                  the painting structure, but Mehra’s new thoughts were to avoid
                  the penetration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The seventh requirement ([<strong>table 21.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/table-21-1))—that
                  the adhesive selected should not be allowed to permeate the
                  canvas, ground, and paint film—is closely related to Mehra’s
                  second requirement. Mehra wanted the adhesive to form only a
                  film between old and new canvases, instead of penetrating the
                  structure. This idea has prevailed in many traditions, and the
                  nap-bond lining (or, in Scandinavia, lamination, inspired by
                  Bent Hacke) became popular among progressive conservators of
                  the time. The nap-bond technique was considered minimal
                  intervention and was intended to ensure reversibility. Saving
                  the physical integrity of an object is written into E.C.C.O.’s
                  Professional Guidelines, in article V of the Code of Ethics
                  ([[E.C.C.O. 2003]]) as well as AIC’s Code of Ethics, article
                  21 of the Guidelines for Practice ([[AIC n.d.]]). Thus, the
                  requirement could probably still be seen as having significant
                  weight, even though both glue paste and wax resin lining are
                  still practiced, as is impregnation of canvas paintings with
                  glue and Beva.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is much in line with the sixth requirement ([<strong>table 21.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/table-21-1)),
                  that increase of weight due to lining should be minimal. This,
                  of course, was in comparison to a wax-resin lining, which was
                  very heavy. A large format could be deformed simply by the
                  weight of a heavy lining material if it was not supported.
                  Lightweight treatments are still preferable, including
                  stretchers and backing boards—especially for large formats—in
                  light of increased loan activity between museums. In these
                  situations, extra weight makes the painting more difficult to
                  handle and increases the risk of high forces due to impact if
                  the painting is dropped during transportation. Furthermore, a
                  heavy structure can increase the risk of failure in the
                  hanging system.

                  The Flexibility Requirement
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The fourth requirement ([<strong>table 21.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/table-21-1))
                  is that flexibility must be guaranteed for an unlimited period
                  of time. It is not specified if Mehra means in the complete
                  lining structure or in the canvas, adhesive, or a possible
                  interleaf. An argument for a flexible lining adhesive was
                  mentioned as early as 1931, when the Canadian painter and
                  sculptor Percyval Tudor-Hart advised that a lining adhesive
                  should provide unlimited flexibility and recommended the
                  “Dutch” adhesive ([[Tudor-Hart 1931]]), and that same year,
                  two American conservators remarked that a wax lining is “the
                  best that is yet found for relining . . . It is flexible,
                  never becoming brittle” ([[Durham and Leser 1931|, 38]]). The
                  unlimited flexibility mentioned by Mehra should be seen in
                  light of these sources and the long historic experience with
                  brittle glue-paste linings. However, flexibility in lining
                  adhesive and flexibility in lining as a whole are two very
                  different concepts. In his requirements, Mehra mentioned the
                  lining as a whole and not just the adhesive. In 1981, he
                  contradicted this requirement in a paper on lining canvases,
                  where he wrote that lining canvases should be as stiff as
                  possible ([[Mehra 1981b]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A year later, Mecklenburg summed up his approach to providing
                  stability in a painting: “[T]o support a painting, the
                  material chosen must: 1) be capable of developing and
                  maintaining a large percentage of the total force of a
                  stretched painting; 2) be able to restrain in-plane
                  displacement as developed by desiccated glue and paint films;
                  3) restrain out-of-plane distortion such as cupping and
                  buckling” ([[Mecklenburg 1982|, 27]])<em>.</em> He furthermore
                  advised that a high modulus<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  of the lining material was preferable and that thickness would
                  provide support against out-of-plane distortions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, research has shown that stiff linings can reduce the
                  risk of further cracks and cupping in a painting
                  ([[Mecklenburg 1982]]; [[Hedley 1988]]; [[Andersen 2013]]),
                  which contradicts Mehra’s 1972 report. However, it is worth
                  remarking that Mehra had been measuring the bending stiffness
                  of the linings he tested, as opposed to the later studies,
                  which measured stiffness in tension. For paintings, this means
                  the difference between in-plane and out-of-plane forces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With this development in mind, it is interesting to observe
                  how Mehra’s early thoughts on flexibility have inspired
                  conservators to require flexible linings ([[Heiber 1987]];
                  [[van Och and Hoppenbrouwers 2003]]). Thus, the properties of
                  lining canvases remained a cause for disagreement within the
                  conservation profession for many years after Mehra’s report,
                  despite the fact that he was the first to change his
                  statement.

                  Degradation Agents—What is Worse?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The fifth requirement ([<strong>table 21.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/table-21-1))
                  was that the use of heat should be avoided altogether, or at
                  least must be considerably minimized. Heat could deform the
                  painting and increase the chemical degradation rate. While
                  this is true, high moisture/water, pressure, and solvents can
                  also have a lasting negative effect on paint layers, and are
                  all used in paintings conservation. The question of what is
                  causing more degradation remains unanswered and relies heavily
                  on the materials and properties of each individual painting.
                  Solvents can cause swelling and leaching in paint and ground
                  layers ([[Phenix 2002]]), and the development of metal soaps
                  can be accelerated by moisture ([[Garrappa et al. 2020]]).
                  However, all of this is a question of the extent and duration
                  of exposure to these elements. The discussion of what is worse
                  for a paint layer—exposure to fluctuating climate or exposure
                  to water or solvents while cleaning, lining, or other
                  conservation treatments—is still unresolved. New research is,
                  however, starting to tackle these questions with, for example,
                  nanoindentation, which allows for the study of the mechanical
                  properties of paint surfaces ([[Andersen et al. 2019]]).

                  Choice of Materials for Specific Purposes
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Mehra’s requirements for linings were widely seen as an
                  argument for nap-bond linings only, but the third and the
                  eighth requirements ([<strong>table 21.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/table-21-1))
                  are actually pointing to the need to adapt each treatment to
                  the specific problem at hand. Thus, the last requirement is
                  that it must be optional to use a selected adhesive, in
                  different degrees of cohesive strength, and that it is
                  imperative that it have the proper resistance to fluctuations
                  in temperature and humidity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mehra advised that the materials used in conservation should
                  have passed selection in direct reference to the specific
                  problems of the painting involved. While this is a nice
                  principle, more specific failure/success criteria are needed
                  in order to make such decisions. Very little advice is
                  provided for choosing the amount of strength, stiffness,
                  moisture, solvent, pressure, and so forth needed; thus, the
                  choice of materials and methods largely remains a matter of
                  practical experience and tacit knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consider the case of a very torn canvas painting with frayed
                  tacking edges. Different conservation traditions would imply
                  different solutions to this problem. Everything from tear
                  mending to glue-paste, wax-resin, and synthetic adhesive
                  linings would be used and justified as the right treatment for
                  this specific problem, depending on which tradition the
                  conservator was trained in. This reality is a testament to the
                  reality that conservation is still a craft when it comes to
                  structural treatments and that very little science-based
                  consensus is found.

                <h3 id="compatibility" tabindex="-1">Compatibility</h3>
                <p>
                  In the last requirement ([<strong>table 21.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/table-21-1))
                  Mehra wrote that the lining adhesive should “be compatible
                  with the other materials used for the relining which it
                  serves.” The meaning of “compatible” is not clear, and Mehra
                  does not define it. It remains an open question whether poor
                  compatibility means that the material does not bond well, that
                  is it historically or ethically wrong, or perhaps that it has
                  different properties from the original materials. It is also
                  not clear how compatibility may be judged in a scientific
                  manner. And yet the word is frequently used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In E.C.C.O.’s Code of Ethics article IX, compatibility is
                  included as a requirement, but it remains undefined. The
                  European Committee for Standardization (CEN) standard defining
                  the most important general terms used in conservation of
                  cultural heritage EN 15898:2011 defined compatibility as the
                  “extent to which one material can be used with another
                  material without putting significance or stability at risk”
                  ([[CEN 2011|, 10]]). Acknowledging that this was still a
                  rather vague definition, Revez proposed the following
                  definition: “Compatibility corresponds to the extent to which
                  a product, method or action may be used upon a heritage object
                  without putting its present or future significance at risk”
                  ([[Revez 2016]]). In the updated version of the CEN standard
                  from 2019 (EN 15898:2019) the definition was clarified
                  further: “extent to which one material can be used with
                  another material without
                  <em>compromising <strong>significance</strong> or
                    <strong>stability</strong> of the object. Note 1 to entry:
                    this relates to conservation materials or to components of
                    the <strong>object</strong></em>” ([[CEN 2019|, 25]]).

                <p>
                  Useful compatibility indicators have been proposed for stone
                  conservation and the conservation of archeological sites by
                  Rodrigues and Grossi ([[Rodrigues and Grossi 2007]]), but due
                  to the difference in materials, these are not easily
                  translated to paintings conservation. One indicator that might
                  be useful, however, is physical content, which represents
                  “intrinsic properties responsible for the performance of the
                  intervention action, considered in its material side”
                  ([[Rodrigues and Grossi 2007]]). The other indicators are the
                  operational background, the sociocultural context, and the
                  environmental constraints. Assuming that compatibility is a
                  multifaceted concept that can be broken down into a number of
                  simpler categories, they propose a rating system (from 1 to
                  10) for each action taken, which would then be translated to
                  an incompatibility degree for a proposed treatment of stone
                  and buildings. The question remains whether this concept works
                  for structural painting conservation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It seems that in the context of Mehra’s paper, the physical
                  indicator was probably what was more on his mind. If for the
                  sake of simplicity one stays with this concept, it may be
                  possible to propose compatibility indicators for mechanical
                  and structural properties of conservation materials. Problems
                  with the concept of compatibility in the context of canvas
                  paintings include that the materials of canvas paintings
                  (canvas, glue, ground, paint, etc.) have very different
                  properties, and research suggests that lining material should
                  not have the same mechanical and structural properties as the
                  original canvas, as described above. Stiffer and less
                  hygroscopic materials have been found to provide better
                  supports, so perhaps compatibility of structure should rather
                  be considered in relation to the paint and ground layers.
                  Another, and possibly more comprehensive approach, to
                  assessing treatment options is risk assessment, which is
                  considered in the next section.

                  Evaluation of Risk for Linings
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In structural conservation of canvas paintings, very little
                  research progress has been made in the last decades,
                  especially when it comes to predicting the risks of structural
                  conservation treatments. Instead, the tendency has been to
                  avoid treatments. However, one tool that can help us move
                  toward rational risk assessment could be computational finite
                  element modeling to predict stresses and the resultant strain
                  and failure in the painting structure with fluctuating ambient
                  climate conditions. A comprehensive computational model and
                  subsequent parametric studies are missing for both treated and
                  untreated paintings, as is validation of the results through
                  epidemiological paintings collection studies.
                  Computer-generated prediction requires not only detailed model
                  design but also reliable experimental data on material
                  properties that can help answer specific questions about
                  structure and mechanical properties. The potential is
                  promising and can point the way to more solid guides for
                  conservators, but until such a tool exists —with validated
                  results—the best option we have is to rely on risk assessment
                  for guidance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In cleaning literature, the concept of star diagrams for
                  evaluating specific parameters was developed and used
                  repeatedly ([[Daudin-Schotte et al. 2013]]; [[Chung et al.
                  2017]]; [[Ornsby et al. 2019]]; [[Bartoletti et al. 2020]]).
                  This approach could be useful for other conservation
                  treatments as well, and would follow the trend of preventive
                  conservation that moves away from requirements and
                  recommendations or guidelines toward risk assessments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Linings and related structural treatments are still performed
                  widely, and the different alternatives should be evaluated
                  when choosing a treatment option or considering paintings that
                  have already been lined. A star diagram shows risk factors
                  situated around the center ([<strong>fig. 21.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/fig-21-1)).
                  A value from 1 through 5 is given for each risk factor, with 1
                  as low risk and 5 as high risk. This is different from the
                  approaches proposed in the articles referenced above, in that
                  it is intuitive that the higher the rating number the higher
                  the risk, and vice versa. Thus, a smaller shape means lower
                  risk, as shown in <strong>fig. 21.1</strong>. Of course, the
                  scale is a matter of interpretation and must be discussed for
                  each factor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first step is to identify the risks. Using Mehra’s
                  guidance and some updated information, the list in [<strong>table 21.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/table-21-2)
                  could be proposed as examples of eight factors that may imply
                  an increased risk of change in a lined canvas painting. The
                  chosen parameters are inspired by current discussions in the
                  field, such as stresses, color change, change in properties,
                  and so forth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the example of star diagrams for a lining in [<strong>fig. 21.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/fig-21-1),
                  the risk for each parameter for a particular painting has been
                  assessed. The nature of specific paintings and treatments will
                  change the nature of the risk, of course. Risk factors can be
                  added or subtracted as appropriate, and different options can
                  then be compared. Other risks, such as weight change,
                  out-of-plane forces, infestation, and mold growth can also be
                  assessed as needed. In some cases the values for various
                  parameters can be measured in a lab, and the outcome can then
                  be adapted to the same scale, as seen in [Fuster-Lopez et
                  al.](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/21-Andersen/paper-52)

                <p>
                  Fifty years after Mehra formulated his requirements, the
                  concepts he discusses largely remain relevant, even though the
                  context and the understanding of some of them have changed.
                  The eight requirements became very influential, but they must
                  be seen in the context of the lining techniques in use at that
                  time, when wax-resin and glue-paste linings dominated.
                  However, the imposition of requirements for conservation
                  treatment is not a contemporary way of approaching
                  conservation—partly because each painting is different, as
                  Mehra acknowledges, and partly because best practice
                  requirements require a common understanding of the concepts
                  they codify.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many of the concepts used in conservation are elastic. They
                  can be interpreted in various ways and have multiple meanings,
                  and this can prompt endless discussions. The specific
                  interpretation in each case can be attributed to difference in
                  culture, social parameters, stakeholders, technical knowledge,
                  and practical indicators. This means they can be bent and
                  understood differently depending on the context. If there are
                  misinterpretations of the concepts used, requirements may be
                  worthless, or even misleading. Tacit knowledge is deeply
                  embedded in local conservation traditions, which, of course,
                  complicates the matter further.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Until a comprehensive prediction tool is created, assessment
                  of risks remains the best option. An update of Mehra’s
                  approach was proposed in this paper, in which risks are
                  assessed from certain criteria for each case individually by
                  the conservator who needs to decide between different options.

                        E modulus is derived from a stress/strain test
                        representing change of stress divided by the change in
                        strain in the elastic (Hookean) region. High modulus can
                        be understood as high stiffness.

                  An important recent acquisition to the collection of the
                  National Gallery, London, is the oil on canvas painting
                  <em>Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria</em> (ca.
                  1615–17) by Artemisia Gentileschi (1593–1654), one of only a
                  handful of works by female painters in the collection and the
                  first painting by this artist to be represented at the
                  Gallery. Upon its acquisition in 2018, the painting underwent
                  full conservation treatment in the Gallery’s conservation
                  studios and was presented to the public later that year. The
                  treatment was filmed for the Gallery’s website and made
                  available on YouTube as part of the museum’s public engagement
                  program. The National Gallery has long undertaken structural
                  treatments of its paintings collection, and traditional
                  aqueous glue-paste hand-lining (among other techniques)
                  remains part of its arsenal of lining methods. Research
                  undertaken at the Gallery in the late 1990s led to adaptations
                  in the recipe and lining methodology, and glue-paste
                  hand-lining continues to be used when considered appropriate
                  for a painting’s requirements. This paper presents the
                  structural treatment of Artemisia’s <em>Self-Portrait</em> to
                  remove the existing aged and failing glue-paste lining, repair
                  the torn damage to the original canvas support, reinforce the
                  original canvas join, and reline with glue-paste adhesive.
                  Also addressed is the issue surrounding the painting’s
                  original format, thought to have been reduced in size at some
                  point, and resolved to some extent in collaboration with the
                  curatorial department. The preparatory steps for lining,
                  including tear repair and moisture flattening treatment and
                  the various stages of the hand-relining process are described
                  in detail. Techniques unique to the National Gallery’s
                  glue-paste hand-lining processes are discussed, such as the
                  use of wax-resin facings and beeswax moisture barriers, and
                  details of the materials and equipment employed (e.g., the
                  low-pressure vacuum table) are included.

                <p>
                  In July 2018, the National Gallery, London, acquired a
                  self-portrait by the Italian Baroque artist Artemisia
                  Gentileschi, one of only a handful of works by female painters
                  in the collection and the first painting by this artist to be
                  represented at the Gallery. The painting,
                  <em>Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria</em> (ca.
                  1615–17), depicts the artist herself as Saint Catherine of
                  Alexandria, the Christian saint martyred in the early fourth
                  century ([<strong>fig. 22.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/22-Harrison/fig-22-1)).
                  Her right hand holds the martyr’s palm close to her chest,
                  while she rests her left hand on a broken wheel with iron
                  spikes, the instrument of Catherine’s torture and the saint’s
                  standard attribute. The painting dates from Artemisia’s period
                  of activity in Florence, where she lived and worked from 1613
                  to 1620, establishing herself as an independent artist and
                  becoming the first woman to gain membership to the Accademia
                  della Arti del Disegno, in 1616 ([[Bissell 1968|, 154]];
                  [[Bissell 1999|, 141]]; [[Whitlum-Cooper et al. 2019]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upon acquisition, the canvas painting was conserved in the
                  National Gallery conservation department, where the decision
                  was made to reline the painting and to clean and restore the
                  image. The entire treatment was filmed for the National
                  Gallery’s website and made available on YouTube as part of the
                  Gallery’s public engagement program.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Conservation was led by Larry Keith (chief restorer and
                  keeper), and the structural treatment was undertaken by Paul
                  Ackroyd (senior restorer) and the author.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting was originally executed on a medium-weight,
                  plain-weave canvas, with a horizontal seam approximately 7&nbsp;cm
                  up from the bottom edge. The seam is uneven and rather wavy in
                  appearance ([<strong>fig. 22.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/22-Harrison/fig-22-2)),
                  and is likely to have been sewn by the artist: it is known
                  that at this time Artemisia was poor—“she was beleaguered with
                  financial problems,” and probably therefore was preparing and
                  reusing her own canvases for painting ([[Barker 2017|, 59]];
                  [[Keith et al. 2019|, 8n23, 16n24]]) .
                </p>
                <p>
                  Around the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, the
                  painting was glue-paste lined onto another linen canvas and
                  attached to its existing mortise-and-tenon joint stretcher. At
                  the time of acquisition by the National Gallery, the painting
                  had old discolored restorations and was coated with a
                  significantly yellowed and poorly saturating varnish (see
                  [<strong>fig. 22.1</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/22-Harrison/fig-22-1)).
                  Impact damage in the lower left of the painting had resulted
                  in an irregular 3.8 cm long tear to both the original and
                  lining canvas. The original seam was pronounced and
                  potentially weak, as the seam flap at the back would have been
                  cut away for the previous lining treatment. The remains of the
                  sewing stitches were now visible on the front, partially
                  hidden by restoration (see [<strong>fig. 22.2</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/22-Harrison/fig-22-2)).
                  The lining was found to be generally degraded, fragile, and
                  easily detachable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Three original edges remained relatively intact, with
                  exaggerated cusping present along the bottom edge and some
                  cusping present on the two vertical edges. The right edge also
                  had evidence of being modified; it had been previously folded,
                  such as over a stretcher edge, and then later flattened
                  ([[Keith et al. 2019|, 6, 16n11]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  There was also evidence to suggest the top edge had been
                  previously cut down slightly: the tip of the martyr’s palm and
                  the central pearl of the saint’s crown were both missing (see

                  History of Lining at the National Gallery
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The National Gallery has a long history of undertaking
                  structural treatments, including lining, and is active in
                  maintaining traditional practices as well as researching and
                  developing new methods and technologies ([[Bomford 1978]];
                  [[Reeve, Ackroyd, and Stephenson-Wright 1988]]; [[Young and
                  Ackroyd 2001]]). Aqueous glue-paste hand-linings were first
                  undertaken for the Gallery by private liners, who were
                  commissioned by the Gallery. In a letter from the Gallery
                  Archives (date unknown) the Gallery’s first director, Sir
                  Charles Eastlake, writes to inform colleagues that “Mr.
                  William Morrill of 3 Duck Lane, Wardour Street is ordinarily
                  employed for the re-lining of pictures in the collection.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  In 1880, Morrill himself writes to the director: “The price of
                  double lining the large Weenix picture will be about 14
                  pounds. I should have written before but I have been very busy
                  with the Crivelli picture which I hope very soon to
                  complete.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>

                  While the Gallery established its conservation department in
                  1946, it wasn’t until the late 1940s and early 1950s that its
                  conservators were directly employed by the Gallery ([[Bomford
                  1978|, 3]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>^,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  Glue paste was the only lining adhesive used at the Gallery
                  until around 1947, when wax-resin adhesive began to be used as
                  an alternative adhesive, until the late 1970s, with the advent
                  of Beva 371. All linings were done by hand until the studio
                  bought its first vacuum hot table in 1976 ([[Reeve, Ackroyd,
                  and Stephenson-Wright 1988]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Traditional aqueous glue-paste hand-lining remains part of the
                  conservation department’s methods for structural treatments
                  for canvas paintings and is chosen when appropriate for a
                  painting’s requirements, for example, when considering the
                  type and extent of damage, the painting’s overall condition,
                  and its treatment history. Its use, however, has evolved over
                  the last thirty years. The current modified glue-paste recipe
                  is the result of research undertaken at the Gallery in the
                  late 1990s by Paul Ackroyd that evaluated the bond performance
                  and relative stiffness of glue-paste linings. Tests revealed
                  that a low ratio of glue to flour paste proved desirable,
                  providing a lining that is more dimensionally stable than
                  those with a higher glue content ([[Ackroyd 1995|, 89]]). The
                  proportion of glue now used, at 1 part glue to 6 parts flour
                  paste, contains far less glue than traditionally used in the
                  UK and is more akin to European formulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Gallery’s current technique is also distinct from other
                  traditional methods, in that natural beeswax is used in the
                  process: as part of the facing adhesive, as a lubricant during
                  the lining phase, and as a moisture barrier applied after
                  lining ([[Phenix 1995|, 26]]). A cold wax-resin facing
                  adhesive is used at the Gallery for paintings that do not have
                  absorbent ground or paint layers. It is made with dammar
                  resin, beeswax, and mineral spirit (a low-aromatic
                  petroleum-based solvent) and is brushed out thinly on to the
                  painted surface as a cold liquid over a paper tissue facing
                  ([<strong>fig. 22.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/22-Harrison/fig-22-3)),
                  usually over a temporary varnish (see the appendix for the
                  recipe).
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are distinct advantages to using a wax-resin facing as
                  part of the glue-paste lining methodology. It becomes
                  semitransparent during ironing and can be easily removed with
                  mineral spirit during the lining process, allowing the
                  painting’s surface to be visibly inspected without disturbing
                  the lining adhesive. This cannot be done, for example, with an
                  aqueous adhesive facing. Cold wax-resin facings are also
                  simple to apply and pose minimal risk of dimensional change to
                  the painting or of any potential for inducing shrinkage (of
                  either the painting or the facing tissue). They create a weak
                  but effective bond to protect the painted surface from
                  accidental abrasion during delining, and provide a soft,
                  slightly cushioning surface. They can also be applied over
                  other facings if additional protection is necessary.

                  Treatment Strategy
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The treatment to reline Artemisia’s <em>Self-Portrait</em> was
                  chosen over other treatment options, such as strip-lining and
                  loose-lining, as its overall condition was perceived as too
                  fragile to be left unlined. The level of degradation of the
                  original linen (being over four hundred years old), together
                  with damage to the original seam and the tear through the
                  original and old lining, had compromised the original canvas’s
                  ability to support the ground and paint layer at the required
                  tension when the painting was reattached to its stretcher.
                  Relining would also support the new canvas addition to the top
                  edge (see New Canvas Addition below) and help keep it in
                  alignment with the original. The painting was also impregnated
                  with animal glue from the previous glue lining, which could
                  lead to future problems with the painting’s response to
                  moisture if it were not supported with a new lining canvas and
                  moisture barrier.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  Remaining unlined would thus leave the painting in a
                  vulnerable state. Additionally, the unusual planned loan
                  conditions for the painting after treatment—a multivenue
                  tour—would also be of concern if the painting were left
                  unlined.

                <p>
                  After cleaning to remove the old varnish, restoration, and
                  fills, the painting was taken to the Gallery’s structural
                  studio for relining. First, the tear deformations were
                  reduced, the torn canvas fibers were realigned, and the area
                  was treated with local moisture and weight. The loose paint
                  fragments at the tear edge were consolidated with sturgeon
                  glue, and the tear was locally faced with fine paper tissue
                  and wheat-starch paste, with the tissue edges feathered out.
                  The whole painted surface was then faced with a piece of
                  Eltoline tissue brushed over with the cold wax-resin facing
                  mixture (see [<strong>fig. 22.3</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/22-Harrison/fig-22-3)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting was then removed from its stretcher, the old
                  lining tacking margins were cut through at the turnover edge,
                  and the painting lifted clear. This process was hampered
                  somewhat, as the old lining canvas was stuck to the stretcher
                  along the bottom edge and left corner. Evidence of water
                  staining on the back in these areas indicated the lining
                  adhesive may have been reactivated by water, causing the back
                  of the lining canvas to adhere to the wooden stretcher bar.
                  Fortunately, these areas were easily released by sliding a
                  thin metal spatula between the old lining canvas and the
                  stretcher and easing the two apart.

                  The painting was turned face down, and its edges taped to a
                  Melinex (clear polyester film) covered plywood board to
                  prevent dirt and hard grains of brittle glue-paste residue
                  from getting under the painting and embedding in the facing
                  during the removal of the old lining. (This is one noteworthy
                  disadvantage of wax-resin facings to guard against: debris can
                  easily get trapped in its waxy surface, risking damage to the
                  paint surface, especially during mechanical scraping.) The old
                  lining was then reversed, the lining fabric peeled away in
                  strips by hand, and the remaining glue-paste residue scraped
                  from the surface with a scalpel ([[National Gallery 2019|,
                  video 6]]).
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Old insect damage, in the form of woodworm exit holes, was
                  found within the back of the original canvas corresponding to
                  the likely position of a previous wooden stretcher or strainer
                  (the current stretcher has no insect damage). Luckily, this
                  damage did not penetrate through to the paint surface, so the
                  holes in the canvas could be filled from the back with an
                  adhesive mix of Mowiol GE 04-86 (polyvinyl alcohol), chalk,
                  and pigment using a small metal spatula. Mowiol remains
                  soluble in water, so care is needed during the lining process
                  not to disturb the fills. Rather usefully, Mowiol is also
                  thermoplastic when dry, and can be softened and flattened
                  out—with, for example, an electric spatula—to conform with the
                  lining process, thereby avoiding the creation of any
                  undulations or hard bumps behind the original canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The original seam was strengthened with a PVA (polyvinyl
                  acetate) adhesive, Resin ‘W,’ bulked with cellulose powder to
                  fill any small gaps. Small losses in the original canvas
                  (including parts of the seam) were filled with canvas inserts
                  cut from new primed, linen canvas and adhered in place with
                  the same PVA adhesive. This new primed canvas was wetted and
                  stretched before use to reduce its response to moisture. The
                  tear was then butt joined from the back with the PVA adhesive,
                  and cellulose powder and a few additional linen fibers were
                  also used to fill any small holes and gaps and add strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Resin ‘W’ remains sensitive to water when first dry and is
                  softened by heat once fully dry. When used either alone or
                  mixed with small proportions of cellulose powder it makes a
                  good malleable adhesive/filler that will allow inserts and
                  repairs to be perfectly aligned with the original and conform
                  well with the lining process. Although PVAs are known to
                  become brittle with age ([[Down 2009]]; [[Howells et al.
                  1993]]), Resin ‘W’ has been used at the Gallery for some time
                  for discrete canvas repairs. It does harden on aging, making
                  it difficult to remove entirely, but it has proved
                  durable—more so than other similar adhesives.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>

                <p>
                  After the repairs were complete and the facing was removed,
                  the painting was treated with moisture using the studio’s
                  low-pressure suction table to reduce any undulations in the
                  original canvas and any cupping and deformations in the paint
                  layer ([<strong>fig. 22.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/22-Harrison/fig-22-4)).
                  The painting was sprayed on the back with distilled water and
                  laid face up on the table on top of a layer of sailcloth
                  (polyester) fabric, which was used as a permeable release
                  layer to prevent the painting from sticking to the tabletop.
                  The painting and the whole of the table was then covered with
                  a sheet of thin Melinex.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The table was heated to 40°C, at 28 mbar (0.83 "Hg) for
                  about twenty minutes. During this time, additional pressure
                  was applied locally to the surface of the painting using a
                  heated spatula set to the same temperature as the table
                  ([[National Gallery 2019|, video 7]]; see [<strong>fig. 22.4</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/22-Harrison/fig-22-4)).
                  Raised areas and dips in the surface topography were marked up
                  on a Melinex template for further examination from the back
                  once the painting was removed from the table. The painting was
                  dried out under pressure.

                  Using the low-pressure suction table in this way has become an
                  integral part of the glue-paste lining process at the Gallery.
                  Firstly, moisture treatments using the table provide the
                  opportunity to witness under controlled conditions how the
                  painting responds to moisture, in preparation for the upcoming
                  aqueous relining treatment. Secondly, it enables critical
                  inspection of the surface topography of the painting under
                  acute raking light and provides the chance to work on some of
                  the most raised areas that are considered disturbing to the
                  overall surface appearance.

                <p>
                  Once dry, the painting was removed from the suction table and
                  returned, face down, to the Melinex-covered board. With the
                  aid of the Melinex template, the marked-up areas were further
                  investigated, and where necessary, scraped or filled to reduce
                  their impact on the final surface appearance the painting
                  would have once lined. The filling was done with the same
                  Mowiol-pigment mix used for the wormholes.

                  The lack of cusping along the top edge and the appearance of
                  the closely cropped composition led to discussions around the
                  original format of the painting and whether it had been cut

                  piece of new primed linen canvas, similar in weave to the
                  original, was prepared by first wetting and stretching it, and
                  then a strip was cut with the weave oriented with the warp
                  thread vertical and the weft horizontal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  This strip was then profiled to match the top edge of the
                  original canvas and attached with the same PVA
                  adhesive–cellulose powder mix used for the inserts and tear
                  mend. A heated spatula was used to secure the strip just below
                  the original canvas surface.

                  Preparation of the New Lining Canvas
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Next, the lining canvas was prepared. A piece of fine-weave
                  linen larger than the painting on each side was stretched onto
                  a wooden loom, wetted, and restretched to reduce and unify the
                  crimp of the canvas yarns. This produces a stiffer and more
                  isotropic support and reduces its tendency to shrink if
                  exposed to high humidity. Wetting and stretching was done
                  three times; on the third time a deacidification solution of
                  magnesium carbonate was added to the water.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  The linen lining canvas was then left tensioned on the loom
                  throughout the lining process.

                  Preparation of the Glue-Paste
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The day before lining, the adhesive was prepared. The
                  Gallery’s standard recipe uses rabbit skin glue, wheat flour,
                  and water only. The glue is dissolved in some of the measured
                  water by warming gently or being left overnight. The remaining
                  water is warmed in a bain-marie, and the flour added and
                  whisked. This flour-water mix is then added to the dissolved
                  glue and stirred until it is thick with no lumps. The final
                  mix is poured into a plastic tub, covered with Melinex to
                  prevent a skin forming, and set aside to cool. The adhesive
                  should be used within twenty-four hours as no preservative, is
                  included (see Materials and Recipes below).

                  The Lining Process
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Prior to lining, the surface of the painting was again faced
                  again with Eltoline tissue and cold wax resin. Every step of
                  the lining process was then planned out, the equipment
                  gathered, and the method run through. This is particularly
                  important with a glue-paste lining, as when the painting is
                  wet with the glue paste it is at its most vulnerable to
                  movement and change, so it is important to work precisely and
                  quickly. The work surface was covered with newspaper (as a
                  blotting paper), the position for the lining canvas loom was
                  marked up on the paper, and the lining irons were set to
                  around 35°C–40°C. A “lining surface” of a raised
                  Melinex-covered base board (the depth of the loom and with
                  dimensions larger than the painting) was also prepared and put
                  to one side. The painting was then laid face down on the
                  newspaper, the glue paste smeared over the back of the
                  painting by hand, and worked to a smooth, thin, even layer
                  using a brush ([<strong>fig. 22.5</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/22-Harrison/fig-22-5)).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  Hand application of glue paste allows for close assessment of
                  the surface as the adhesive is applied, and any changes can be
                  felt immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next the loomed lining canvas was placed directly on top of
                  the painting, following the premarked registers on the
                  newspaper. The lining canvas was pressed onto the back of the
                  painting by hand to lightly attach the painting so that it
                  could be turned over and placed, face up, on the
                  (Melinex-covered) raised board. The painting surface was then
                  ironed over the tissue facing for forty minutes or so, with
                  the warm lining irons using only the weight of the irons and
                  no additional pressure. Once the whole surface was worked over
                  and the back fully saturated, the painting was placed
                  vertically for a couple of hours so the structure could begin
                  to dry. Then the painting was returned to the table and, with
                  the iron temperature increased slightly to around 50°C–55°C,
                  the painting was ironed for a second time ([<strong>fig. 22.6</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/22-Harrison/fig-22-6)).
                  It was then again placed vertically for a further period to
                  dry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting was then returned to the table and the wax-resin
                  facing removed with mineral spirit so the paint surface could
                  be inspected for any faults, undulations, or problems with the
                  lining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                  A fresh piece of facing tissue was then laid on the painting,
                  and the surface ironed for a final time, with the iron
                  temperature increased to around 65°C–70°C and with melted wax
                  on the iron plate to lubricate the iron across the tissue
                  facing. Work proceeded over the painting, keeping the irons
                  moving to prevent any hot spots and with the iron being
                  returned to the beeswax block to pick up more wax to keep the
                  iron well lubricated this achieved a smooth and controlled
                  lining process. Once complete, the painting was lifted from
                  the lining board and propped up to allow air to circulate and
                  the painting to thoroughly dry out overnight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following day the facing tissue was removed with mineral
                  spirit. The tabletop was prepared with a thin blanket and
                  Melinex release layer, and the loomed, lined painting was
                  placed face down on top of the Melinex. Beeswax was ironed
                  into the back of the lining canvas as a barrier to moisture.
                  The wax does not impregnate the original reverse because the
                  coherent glue-paste adhesive layer prevents this ([[National
                  Gallery 2019|, video 8]]; [[Ackroyd 1995|, 89]]; [[Young and
                  Ackroyd 2001|, 101]]).

                  Modifications to the Old Wooden Stretcher and Restretching
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The old wooden stretcher was modified. Wooden battens were
                  added to the edges to accommodate the new addition and
                  slightly increase the overall size of the stretcher. This
                  ensured the original edges of the painting were kept away from
                  the edge of the stretcher to reduce the risk of delamination
                  from the lining during restretching. The excess visible lining
                  would be framed out, as a new frame, contemporary to the
                  painting, was sourced. New keys were made to replace the old
                  damaged and missing keys.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting was cut from the loom, leaving about a 12-cm
                  tacking margin, and reattached to its stretcher with copper
                  tacks, tapped into the stretcher at regular intervals.
                  Finally, as with all lined paintings at the Gallery, the keys
                  were tied in with nylon wire and brass screws and cups. The
                  tacking margins were trimmed, folded, ironed flat against the
                  back of the stretcher, and attached with galvanized staples.
                  The painting was then returned to the restoration studio to
                  complete the treatment ([<strong>fig. 22.7</strong>](file:///Users/RBarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/22-Harrison/fig-22-7)).

                <p>
                  <em>Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria</em> by
                  Artemisia Gentileschi was a significant acquisition and
                  conservation project for the Gallery. A film series of the
                  full treatment process including cleaning, structural
                  treatment, and restoration was made and published on both the
                  Gallery’s website ([[National Gallery 2019]]) and YouTube and
                  was well received. Further investigations into the painter’s
                  process were also undertaken ([[Keith et al. 2019]];
                  [[Melchiorre Di Crescenzo et al. 2019]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  After treatment, the painting embarked on a nationwide tour to
                  unusual venues across the UK, the first venue coinciding with
                  International Women’s day on March 8, 2019, traveling in total
                  to two libraries, a doctor’s surgery, a school, and a
                  prison.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  Thereafter, the portrait was included in the Gallery’s major
                  exhibition, <em>Artemisia</em>, October 2020–January 2021,
                  which included forty-one works from public and private
                  collections and showcased the artist in the first major
                  exhibition of her work in the UK.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>

                        On inspection of the original canvas, it was considered
                        unnecessary to undertake any overall consolidation of
                        the original canvas.

                        It was important to consider the weave orientation of
                        the strip. Having the warp thread vertical restricts its
                        horizontal movement when wet, thereby reducing the risk
                        of imposing dimensional change on the original during
                        this stage of treatment. When wet, the new machine-woven
                        canvas curls convexly to the surface in the warp
                        direction while also shrinking in the warp direction.

                        Magnesium carbonate is not soluble in water. It is mixed
                        with a small amount of water into a paste, put in a soda
                        syphon with a quantity of distilled water (up to 1
                        litre), and then the release of two carbon dioxide
                        capsules into the syphon turns the magnesium carbonate
                        into bicarbonate, which is soluble in water. The
                        resulting water mixture is applied to the canvas. When
                        dry, the magnesium bicarbonate reverts to magnesium
                        carbonate, and this is what is left within the structure
                        of the canvas. See [[Ryder 1986]].

                  <em>The Grand Panorama</em>
                  <em>of a Whaling Voyage ’Round the World</em> is an 8 1/2 x
                  1,300 foot painting worked in distemper on cotton muslin
                  ([<strong>fig. 23.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/23-Tarleton/fig-23-1)).
                  Completed in 1848, it was painted by Benjamin Russell and
                  Caleb Pierce Purrington and begins in the busy harbor of New
                  Bedford, Massachusetts, taking the viewer on a world tour
                  highlighting the adventures and terrors of the
                  nineteenth-century world of whaling. Designed to be a moving
                  panorama, mounted on upright spools and attached to a
                  structure that allowed it to be scrolled across a stage, it
                  traveled the country and entertained audiences from the 1840s
                  through the latter decades of the nineteenth century. In 1918,
                  it was donated to the New Bedford Whaling Museum (NBWM) in New
                  Bedford, Massachusetts, where various sections of it were
                  temporarily exhibited throughout the twentieth century.

                  Divided into four separate rolls, it is constructed from two
                  lengths of muslin, whipstitched together by hand along their
                  selvages, creating a central horizontal seam that runs the
                  length of the painting. The painting on each roll has an
                  approximately 5-foot long section of unpainted cotton at its
                  beginning and end. A 3/16 inch diameter cotton bolt rope is
                  whipstitched along the upper edge.

                  The primary objective of this conservation project was to
                  stabilize the panorama to enable safe handling and storage and
                  static vertical display of the object. ConText Inc. was
                  responsible for treating all the textile condition issues
                  present on the painting. This paper details the many
                  challenges of treating the massive painting and how the scale
                  and format of the object factored into the treatment decisions
                  made throughout the project. The approach to developing
                  treatment protocols for the range of known condition issues
                  present on the painting is described, as well as how
                  previously unknown condition issues uncovered during the
                  stabilization process were managed. The treatment discussion
                  includes decisions regarding the retention of historic
                  repairs, the reversal of prior stabilization and mounting
                  treatments, and the rejoining of previously separated
                  sections.

                  Condition Prior to Treatment
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In 2001, the New Bedford Whaling Museum conducted a condition
                  survey of the panorama, the first such survey of the object
                  ever undertaken. Each roll was examined on a flat surface by a
                  group of trained volunteers who filled out condition
                  checklists for each 10-foot section of panorama. In all,
                  twenty-six types of condition issues were recorded; the
                  detailed written documentation and accompanying photographs
                  are housed in four binders at the museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The entire painted surface of the panorama was documented as
                  unstable; according to the survey findings, the paint was
                  powdering and flaking. Throughout, the cloth was wrinkled or
                  creased to varying degrees, distorting the painted imagery and
                  promoting the flaking of the painted surface. Although the
                  cotton panorama fabric was reported to be in stable condition
                  overall, numerous examples of textile damage were noted across
                  the four rolls, including stains, holes, tears, seam breaks,
                  full vertical cuts, unpicked seams, and prior mends and
                  patches. Possible mold damage was also noted. At the time of
                  the condition survey, the panorama was in thirteen separate
                  pieces, some of which were out of sequence. Of these thirteen
                  pieces, two 8 1/2 x approximately 50-foot sections were
                  adhered to a heavyweight Mylar backing with an unknown
                  adhesive.

                  Treatment Protocols
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In 2012, the New Bedford Whaling Museum convened a team of
                  experts to study the best museum and conservation practices in
                  order to develop a protocol for preserving the panorama. The
                  group visited institutions and interviewed professionals who
                  had previous experience with similar objects. The National
                  Endowment for the Humanities–funded project resulted in the
                  2013 NBWM Panorama Advisory Group Report “Preserving an
                  American Treasure: A Proposed Treatment Protocol for
                  Purrington &amp; Russell’s Original Panorama Painting of a
                  Whaling Voyage ’Round the World, 1848–1851.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The report’s treatment protocol for reducing the wrinkles in
                  the panorama’s fabric and consolidating the painted surface
                  was adopted for this project*.* The recommended treatment
                  encompassed spraying the painted cloth with a gelatin-based
                  consolidant, which was found to simultaneously reduce the
                  extensive wrinkling and stabilize the flaking paint. The
                  treatment also had the advantage of posing fewer ventilation
                  concerns than the use of an acrylic consolidant such as
                  Paraloid B72.
                </p>
                <p>
                  No specific textile stabilization treatment protocols were
                  recommended in the 2013 report. ConText Inc. developed a
                  series of protocols to ensure the use of uniform treatment
                  methods for the many different types of textile condition
                  issues known to be present on the panorama (broken stitching,
                  holes/loss, tears, vertical cuts, etc.). The focus of protocol
                  development was to design physically supportive, minimally
                  intrusive, and visually nondisruptive treatment methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A number of “damaged” textile samples were fabricated from
                  medium-weight cotton muslin of similar weight and thread count
                  as the panorama fabric. Each sample represented a different
                  documented condition issue found on the panorama (holes,
                  tears, etc.). These samples were stabilized with both stitched
                  and adhesive treatments, using a variety of fabric and thread
                  types. The stabilized samples were then evaluated based on
                  strength, hand, appearance, and suitability to the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The chosen treatment methods included the use of custom-dyed
                  cotton fabric underlays stitched in place using sheer
                  polyester thread in the painted portion of the panorama and
                  cotton-polyester thread in the blank and rope-edge areas of
                  the panorama. Custom-dyed bobbinet was chosen as an overlay
                  fabric for areas of extreme fabric weakness or deterioration.
                  Although tested, no adhesive treatments were chosen for
                  inclusion in the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A localized approach to stabilization was taken, treating
                  individual condition issues as needed. Lining the panorama as
                  a means of stabilization and support was not considered
                  necessary, nor was it recommended. Lining the panorama would
                  have essentially doubled the weight of the monumental object,
                  concealing details on the object’s reverse, and adding to the
                  complexity of rolled storage. The panorama is not a truly flat
                  textile: the fabric tension varies from the upper rope edge to
                  the middle horizontal seam to the selvage lower edge, so
                  imposing a flat lining on the object could lead to planar
                  distortion of the panorama fabric.

                <p>
                  A streamlined documentation system was designed to ensure
                  consistent treatment reporting throughout the stabilization
                  project. First, a standard list of condition and treatment
                  terms was compiled; these terms were amended over the course
                  of the project to include all condition issues encountered and
                  treatments utilized. Worksheets were designed for documenting
                  treatment on each 10-foot section of panorama; this system was
                  based on the 2001 condition reporting project worksheet so
                  that data from both projects could be easily compared. These
                  worksheets were organized in four binders, one for each roll
                  of panorama. Additional treatment notes and photos were added
                  to the binders as necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although each treated area was described, noted, and mapped on
                  the worksheets, not every treated area was photodocumented. By
                  not photographing every single treatment (many of which were
                  repeated numerous times within each 10-foot section), the
                  documentation process was streamlined. Instead, a
                  representative sampling of all condition and treatment types
                  was digitally documented throughout the project. Lastly, a
                  treatment checklist for each 10-foot section of panorama was
                  developed to ensure all treatment practice was standardized
                  throughout the project.

                  The panorama was stabilized on site at the New Bedford Whaling
                  Museum. This arrangement allowed the conservators access to
                  key NBWM staff throughout the duration of the project and
                  minimized transport and handling of the rolled panorama
                  sections.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following recommendations in the 2013 NBWM Panorama Advisory
                  Group Report, a custom-built table was constructed for
                  consolidating the panorama’s painted surface. The smooth,
                  horizontal table surface was equipped with hardware at each
                  side to hold the large storage drums on which the panorama was
                  rolled. A roll of untreated panorama was mounted to one side
                  of the table, unrolled and scrolled across the horizontal
                  surface for consolidation spraying, and then rolled onto an
                  uptake drum at the opposite side of the table.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A tension frame was designed in order to implement the textile
                  stabilization treatments on the panorama. The frame was
                  constructed in four separate sections for maximum versatility.
                  This apparatus consisted of four rolling horizontal beams that
                  could be held under tension: a rear beam, which held the
                  untreated panorama roll; two upper beams, which supported and
                  separated the pretreatment and posttreatment sections of the
                  panorama; and a front beam; which was the take-up roll for the
                  treated panorama.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Textile treatment took place in the space between the upper
                  and front beams. The face and reverse of the panorama were
                  fully accessible to the conservators in this space ([<strong>fig. 23.2</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/23-Tarleton/fig-23-2)).
                  Having access to both sides of the painting not only
                  facilitated stabilization treatment, it also revealed
                  condition issues that were not visible during the 2001
                  condition survey. These were mainly additional areas of
                  weakness and patched repairs. The approximately two hundred
                  areas of the panorama recommended for treatment in the 2001
                  survey swelled to over 2,050 treated areas by the time the
                  project was completed.

                  The surface media was consolidated by NBWM staff before the
                  textile stabilization process commenced. The latter work was
                  accomplished in two phases. The first involved separating the
                  two lengths of panorama adhered to Mylar from their backings
                  in order to stabilize and then rejoin them into their proper
                  sequence in the panorama. The second was to stabilize all the
                  textile condition issues present on each panorama roll. This
                  was achieved by systematically treating and documenting each
                  panorama roll in 10-foot sections, following the treatment
                  protocols developed at the start of the project.

                <p>
                  The method employed for consolidating the panorama’s flaking
                  paint was based on a treatment first developed at the St.
                  Louis Art Museum by painting conservator Paul Haner during the
                  conservation of the
                  <em>Monumental Grandeur of the Mississippi Valle</em>y
                  panorama. Further testing and refinement of the method was
                  conducted by NBWM staff prior to treatment. The panorama’s
                  painted surface was sprayed with a 0.75% solution of
                  conservation-grade gelatin and distilled water using a Dahlia
                  sprayer. One 10-foot section at a time, the painted surface
                  was sprayed with the solution until saturated and then allowed
                  to air dry flat on the horizontal spray table before the
                  panorama was rolled ahead and the next section treated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The treatment successfully consolidated the painted surface
                  and reduced the overall wrinkles and creases in the fabric.
                  Two small areas on roll 1 required additional consolidation
                  treatment during the textile stabilization phase of the
                  project. In these areas, the original surface had been
                  overpainted, and the resulting thick paint layer was not fully
                  consolidated by the initial gelatin treatment. A 1.5%
                  gelatin–distilled water solution was brushed onto these areas
                  and allowed to air dry.

                <h3 id="mylar-removal" tabindex="-1">Mylar Removal</h3>
                <p>
                  Several methods were tested for removing the heavy Mylar
                  backing adhered to two 50-foot sections of the panorama (roll
                  3, sections 33–37, and roll 4, sections 11–15). Mechanical
                  means, heat, and solvents were all tested, with varying
                  degrees of success. The most effective method, and the one
                  chosen for the project, was using methanol vapor to soften the
                  adhesive. The panorama was placed face down on the work
                  surface for this treatment; the front and rear rolling beams
                  of the tension frame were used to advance the panorama as the
                  work progressed. Methanol-dampened blotters (6 x 18 inch) were
                  slipped between the work surface and the panorama face, and
                  the vapor was allowed to penetrate the substrate for several
                  minutes. After the adhesive softened, the plastic backing was
                  mechanically separated from the panorama in small strips. Most
                  of the adhesive residue remained adhered to the Mylar backing
                  during this process. Adhesive residue remaining on the
                  panorama fabric reverse was softened with the application of
                  methanol via cotton swabs and mechanically removed using a
                  small spatula. The adhesive was not uniformly applied
                  throughout the two lengths of panorama. In some sections the
                  application was light, making removal relatively simple. In
                  areas of dense application, the removal process was much
                  slower.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to the adhesive described above, at least one
                  other adhesive and a variety of double-sided tapes had been
                  used to attach the Mylar backing to the upper edge of the
                  roll&nbsp;3 panorama length. The backing was removed from this area
                  in the manner noted above, and adhesive residue remaining on
                  the panorama reverse was mechanically removed after softening
                  with acetone applied with a cotton swab.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During removal of the Mylar backing from the roll&nbsp;3 panorama
                  length, an area of especially strong adhesive was encountered.
                  It was darker than the adhesive removed from the panorama up
                  to that point, and much more resistant to removal attempts.
                  This adhesive swelled in contact with methanol but did not
                  easily roll up or scrape off. Unlike the other adhesive, the
                  residue of this adhesive was embedded in the weave of the
                  panorama fabric. After testing methods of removal (heat and
                  solvents), it was determined that the amount of mechanical
                  action (scraping) necessary for complete removal put too much
                  stress on the panorama fabric. This area of tacky adhesive
                  residue was left in place on the panorama reverse. To prevent
                  the panorama from sticking to itself during rolled storage, a
                  length of scoured cotton muslin was laid on the panorama
                  reverse to cover the area of residue and then rolled with the
                  panorama onto the roll 3 storage drum. This area covered
                  approximately 10 feet of roll&nbsp;3, sections 35 and 36. The
                  placement of the muslin underlay was marked on the panorama
                  with twill-tape tags stitched to the upper (rope) edge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In all, approximately 850 square feet of backing were removed
                  from the two lengths of panorama. After removal, the two
                  sections were rolled onto separate storage tubes to await
                  stabilization treatment.

                  The tension frame was used to implement the textile
                  stabilization phase of the project. After a roll was loaded
                  onto the frame, each 10-foot section of panorama was examined,
                  and all condition issues were measured and noted on the
                  documentation worksheets. A twill tape label was stitched to
                  the reverse upper (rope) edge to mark the beginning of each
                  section. Each condition issue was stabilized following the
                  treatment protocols set at the start of the project. These
                  protocols were modified and expanded throughout the project to
                  best suit the variety of condition issues that presented
                  themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The majority of conditions requiring stabilization were holes,
                  tears, seam breaks, and small areas of weakness in the
                  panorama fabric (<strong>[figs.
                    23.3](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/23-Tarleton/fig-23-3),
                    [23.4](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/23-Tarleton/fig-23-4),

                  underlays. All underlay edges were pinked to prevent fraying.
                  Figure eight stitch was used to rejoin most tears and seam
                  breaks; a row of running stitches with intermittent back
                  stitches was worked around the perimeter of all underlays to
                  lend additional stability. Dyed nylon bobbinet stitched
                  overlays were used to stabilize severely abraded and weak
                  areas of the panorama fabric. One particularly large underlay
                  (8 1/2 x 5 feet) was stitched to the blank lead edge of roll 4
                  due to multiple tears, holes, and areas of fabric loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The panorama had patches (both glued and stitched) and
                  previous stitched mends on all four rolls. These repairs were
                  likely made throughout the working life of the panorama, as it
                  travelled from venue to venue for exhibition, and they were
                  considered part of the history of the piece. In most cases,
                  these patches and repairs were left intact, with additional
                  stitched stabilization added as necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two types of glued-on patches were present on the reverse of
                  roll&nbsp;4. The first was a plain-weave, undyed cotton fabric
                  glued onto the reverse with an unknown adhesive. These were
                  generally stable and relatively flexible and so were left
                  intact. The second type was a “Band-Aid” style patch made of
                  cloth book tape with an added layer of cotton fabric in the
                  center. These were loosely adhered at the edges and quite
                  stiff. They were no longer supporting the panorama fabric, and
                  in some cases were putting stress on it. These were
                  mechanically removed and replaced with dyed cotton underlays.
                  The few patches that required removal were photo-documented,
                  labeled, and stored in the treatment documentation binders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All four rolls had small areas of weakness scattered
                  throughout, especially at the rope edge, but rolls 2, 3, and 4
                  exhibited several large areas of significant weakness that
                  were not documented in the original condition survey. These
                  areas, ranging from 10 to 40 inches in height and width, were
                  mainly clustered in the lower half of the panorama fabric.
                  Many of the areas of weakness had small holes and/or tears
                  scattered throughout. These were stabilized with dyed cotton
                  underlays and, in some cases, dyed bobbinet overlays as well
                  ([<strong>fig. 23.6</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/23-Tarleton/fig-23-6)).
                  The larger underlays were stitched around the perimeter and in
                  vertical rows spaced 4 to 6 inches apart to lend stability to
                  the weak fabric.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As previously noted, the panorama was in thirteen sections
                  before stabilization began. Several of these pieces required
                  rejoining along vertical cut lines or unpicked vertical seam
                  lines. This was accomplished by butting the adjoining edges
                  together and stitching them to a dyed cotton underlay
                  ([<strong>fig. 23.7</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/23-Tarleton/fig-23-7)).
                  In all, ten vertical joins were stitched.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On roll 1, sections 9, 10, 12, and 13 each had a large
                  three-sided cut (8 x 48 inches) along the upper edge. These
                  date from the 1964 New York World’s Fair, when a 175-foot
                  section of the Panorama was hung for exhibition around the
                  interior walls of a restaurant in the New England States
                  Pavilion. After installation, it was discovered that the
                  Panorama’s upper edge was blocking the air conditioning
                  registers, so the cuts were made to allow the air to flow
                  freely ([[New Bedford Whaling Museum 2018|, 79]]). The cuts in
                  these areas went through the fabric, but the rope was left
                  intact. To stabilize these large areas, the cut edges were
                  aligned as closely as possible (the panorama fabric had
                  stretched slightly along the cut lines during previous
                  vertical exhibition) and stitched to dyed cotton underlays.
                  These dyed underlays filled the small voids where the cut
                  edges of the panorama cloth did not quite butt together during
                  stabilization treatment.

                <p>
                  Roll 2, section 1, received two treatments not applied
                  elsewhere in the project, due to its unique condition issues.
                  As found, this approximately 7 x 9 foot section was not
                  attached to any roll; the proper right edge was an unstitched
                  vertical seam and the left was a full vertical cut. The
                  original upper part of this section was missing and had been
                  replaced with a band of white sheeting. It was labeled
                  “miscellaneous section” in the 2001 condition notes, but
                  during the course of this project its proper right edge was
                  found to match the lead edge of roll 2, section 2, revealing
                  its proper placement in the panorama sequence. The sheeting in
                  the upper part of section 1 was replaced with a dyed cotton
                  panel to return the section to its full original height, and
                  section 1 was subsequently reattached to roll 2, section 2.
                  The other treatment this section received was joining it to a
                  new blank lead, to protect its cut leading edge during
                  handling and storage.

                <p>
                  The final step in the treatment process was to place the four
                  stabilized rolls of panorama onto storage drums. The drums
                  were constructed from four 24-inch diameter Sonotube concrete
                  forms measuring 9 feet, 3 inches in length. The open ends of
                  each tube were fitted with wood plugs that had holes drilled
                  through the center so that the drums could be suspended on
                  metal rods during storage. Each tube was wrapped with a 4-mil
                  barrier layer of Mylar and a layer of Volara foam, secured
                  with double-sided tape.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each length of stabilized panorama was rolled onto a storage
                  drum with the lead edge outermost, wrapped in polyethylene
                  sheeting, labeled, and stored on a dedicated storage rack at
                  the New Bedford Whaling Museum. In conjunction with a
                  customized mount, the conservation treatments described here
                  stabilized this enormous textile for its first complete
                  exhibition in over a hundred years (see [<strong>fig. 23.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/23-Tarleton/fig-23-1)).

                  In preparation for an upcoming exhibition featuring
                  preparatory works by Edwin Austin Abbey (1852–1911) for major
                  mural commissions, conservators at the Yale University Art
                  Gallery treated a 12-foot diameter study for Abbey’s ceiling
                  mural <em>The Passage of the Hours</em> (1904–11). The
                  unvarnished, matte surface of <em>The Hours</em> is well
                  preserved, but improper storage in the early twentieth century
                  caused structural damages to the canvas, including undulating
                  deformations and sharp creases. This case study describes a
                  series of innovative solutions to challenges presented by the
                  structural treatment of this painting, which will travel
                  internationally. A 14-foot round aluminum working strainer was
                  fabricated to help conservators resolve canvas deformations
                  under tension. The painting was loomed temporarily onto this
                  strainer using Velcro attachments. Once on the working
                  strainer, structural damages and deformations were addressed
                  vertically, providing access to both the recto and verso with
                  minimal handling. The painting has been reunited with its
                  original stretcher, itself a collapsible design that
                  disassembles into two loose-lined hemispheres for travel. A
                  segmented edge lining, again using Velcro attachments, was
                  designed to enable the painting to be efficiently and gently
                  stretched at each venue, while adding little additional bulk
                  to the fold-over edges.

                  Painted between 1904 and 1911 by the American artist Edwin
                  Austin Abbey (1852–1911),
                  <em>Cartoon for the Passage of the Hours</em> (henceforth
                  referred to as <em>The Hours</em>) is a 12 foot 6 inch
                  diameter painting in the collection of the Yale University Art
                  Gallery (YUAG) ([<strong>fig. 24.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/24-Schwarz/Schwarz/fig-24-1)).
                  Created as a half-scale study for a 24-foot ceiling painting
                  in the Pennsylvania State Capitol building, this work will
                  feature prominently in an upcoming exhibition of Abbey’s
                  preparatory studies for murals in American public buildings
                  during the Gilded Age, a period referred to by artists of the
                  time as the American Renaissance. Opening at YUAG in the fall
                  of 2024 and traveling to the National Gallery, London, the
                  following spring, this exhibition led conservators to devise
                  unique solutions for the structural treatment, transport, and
                  display of <em>The Hours</em>. These solutions included the
                  fabrication of a custom aluminum working strainer, the use of
                  Velcro hook and loop systems for stretching the painting to a
                  temporary loom and its final strainer, the use of a silicone
                  heating mat for attaching temporary looming strips, and the
                  design of a segmented edge lining template using
                  computer-aided design (CAD) and computerized numerical control
                  (CNC) cutting technology.

                  Although largely unknown today, Edwin Austin Abbey was one of
                  the most prominent American painters working in British and
                  American artistic circles at the turn of the twentieth
                  century. Having begun his career as an illustrator in the
                  publishing firm of Harper and Brothers in New York City, Abbey
                  adopted oil painting in 1889, after moving permanently to
                  England ([[Lucas 1921|, 1:22–196]]). Over the next twenty
                  years, he exhibited several acclaimed paintings of
                  Shakespearean subjects at the Royal Academy, eventually
                  becoming an academician in 1898 ([[Lucas 1921|, 2:317]]). Like
                  many painters of the time, Abbey also possessed a keen
                  interest in mural painting and completed several commissions
                  for British and American public buildings, his most famous
                  being <em>The Quest and Achievement of the Holy Grail</em>,
                  held in the Boston Public Library.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An essential component of Abbey’s artistic process was the
                  creation of hundreds of preparatory studies for each mural or
                  easel composition, many of which are now part of the Edwin
                  Austin Abbey Memorial Collection at YUAG.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Certainly one of Abbey’s largest studies,
                  <em>The Hours</em> may also be one of his most ambitious and
                  visually striking preparatory works. The painting was created
                  as a half-scale study for a 24-foot ceiling painting currently
                  in situ in the House of Representatives Chamber of the
                  Pennsylvania State Capitol building in Harrisburg. In a
                  composition that Abbey described as “one of the most
                  successful designs I have ever made,” the painting depicts
                  twenty-four women, personifications of the hours, moving
                  around the perimeter of a celestial sphere filled with
                  forty-eight constellations of the northern hemisphere ([[Lucas
                  1921|, 2:436]]). Heavily influenced by one of the star maps
                  Peter Apian (1495–1552) published in his
                  <em>Astronomicum Caesareum,</em> the constellations are
                  indicated with carefully placed mordant-gilded stars ([[Ricci
                  2015|, 52]]). With the sun passing from Virgo to Libra, the
                  carefully balanced composition may reference the position of
                  astronomical bodies around the fall equinox, when day and
                  night are equal.

                  <em>The Hours</em> was painted on a fairly open and evenly
                  woven linen canvas (26 x 22 threads per inch) prepared with a
                  commercially primed lead white ground. Abbey used the full
                  width of the cloth, measuring 160 inches from selvage to
                  selvage. As with many of his preparatory works, Abbey applied
                  leanly bound paints in transparent, overlapping washes to
                  create a matte, velvety surface. Dry media is present
                  underneath, between, and on top of the paint layers, as Abbey
                  used charcoal and white chalk to place and later modify the
                  figures and constellations. Gold and silver leaf were applied
                  over impastoed white paint and mordant to create the
                  shimmering effects of the moon, sun, stars, and Milky Way.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                </p>

                  Early inventories of the Abbey Collection indicate that
                  <em>The Hours</em> remained stretched from the beginning of
                  its creation in Abbey’s London studio until his possessions
                  were packed for shipment to New Haven in 1937, when the work
                  was rolled for transport across the Atlantic and subsequently
                  placed into storage for eighty years. <em>The Hours</em> has
                  never been exhibited or treated since its arrival, although it
                  was surveyed and sympathetically rehoused twenty years ago by
                  paintings conservator Anne O’Connor during a rehousing project
                  funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

                  The canvas remains supple and strong, but it displayed severe
                  undulations from decades of tightly rolled storage, creating a
                  corrugated pattern of planar deformations most visible in
                  raking light ([<strong>fig. 24.2</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/24-Schwarz/Schwarz/fig-24-2)).
                  Several strong creases from past folding of the canvas
                  extended the width of the painting and were made more visible
                  by associated ground and paint loss. The tacking and fold-over
                  edges display the most abrasion and loss to the canvas,
                  ground, and paint layers, much of it corresponding to the
                  particular fold patterns of a circular painting. Some of the
                  abrasion and losses along the tacking edges may also have been
                  caused by Abbey rolling the painting back and forth as he
                  worked.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The paint and ground layers are inherently stable, with
                  flaking occurring primarily along canvas creases in the
                  painted surface and fold-over edges. The painting retains its
                  unvarnished, matte surface. Minor burnishing of the surface is
                  visible as small, glossy high points scattered throughout,
                  where the paint film likely rubbed against the roll interleaf.
                  The burnishing is most noticeable in the night half of the
                  painting, where a thin layer of hazy white efflorescence is
                  also present on the robes of the figures.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>

                  Initial Considerations
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The large size, unusual shape, and unique condition concerns
                  of <em>The Hours</em>, along with the particular travel and
                  display requirements of an internationally traveling
                  exhibition, presented several treatment challenges for the
                  conservation team. The matte, underbound paint layers required
                  a minimally saturating, adequately strong, flexible
                  consolidant. Humidity and tension were required to resolve
                  canvas deformations before fitting the painting to its
                  stretcher, necessitating the temporary looming of the painting
                  onto a working strainer. The large size of the painting and
                  its anticipated international travel dictated that
                  <em>The Hours</em> would need to either be rolled during
                  transport and restretched at each venue or stretched onto a
                  folding stretcher. Having located the original stretcher, a
                  design that comes apart in two halves for travel, we decided
                  to use the original and thus transport the painting rolled.
                  The weakened tacking edges and the act of restretching the
                  painting several times during the course of travel required
                  conservators to devise an edge-lining system that would
                  facilitate the safe and efficient stretching and unstretching
                  of the painting while adding minimal extra bulk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To prepare for treatment, a 16 x 16 foot platform of particle
                  board pallets and Masonite was constructed to provide a clean,
                  elevated workspace on the studio floor. The surface was
                  prepared with blotter, Pellon, and tissue to provide a firmly
                  padded surface for structural work. A rolling wooden bridge
                  was also fabricated to span the length of the work,
                  facilitating access to the center of the painting. The
                  painting was unrolled on the platform for examination and
                  documentation, including detailed digital condition maps.

                <p>
                  Solvent testing indicated that the paint surface was highly
                  soluble in aromatics and blanched with aqueous solutions. The
                  matte surface visibly saturated and darkened with many
                  consolidants. A solution of 10% Aquazol 200 in isopropanol and
                  water (1:1), mixed 3:1 with 0.25% funori, achieved adequately
                  strong adhesion for the flaking ground and paint layers. The
                  incorporation of funori reduced the gloss of the consolidant,
                  achieving an appropriately matte surface with no visible
                  difference.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  After initial introduction of isopropanol to the losses to aid
                  flow, the consolidant was delivered with a small brush.
                </p>
                <h3 id="looming" tabindex="-1">Looming</h3>
                <p>
                  Once the ground and paint layers were stabilized, a temporary
                  strainer, or loom, was devised to enable safer handling and
                  the treatment of the planar deformations. Looming the painting
                  allowed it to be humidified upright and under tension, and
                  also enabled conservators to continuously adjust canvas
                  tension as planar deformations were resolved. To account for
                  the wide (up to 1 foot across) flattened fold-over edges, a
                  14-foot aluminum strainer was designed and fabricated from 1
                  1/2 inch hollow square stock by a local metalworking shop.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  The strainer was designed with an internal bisecting
                  stabilizing structure that could be removed for uninterrupted
                  access to the verso. Flanges around the outer edges allowed it
                  to be bolted to the floor for additional stabilization, if
                  necessary, when the cross members were removed. The use of
                  aluminum instead of wood provided rigidity and a lighter
                  structure. To enable the efficient and gentle stretching and
                  unstretching of the painting during travel, a Velcro system
                  was selected in lieu of tacks or staples, thereby minimizing
                  damage that would be caused by repeated piercing of the
                  tacking edges. Velcro also provides a much faster method of
                  stretching a large painting, enabling conservators to attach a
                  12-foot painting to a stretcher in a matter of minutes.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The intermediate looming step presented a valuable opportunity
                  for conservators to test the capabilities of the Velcro
                  attachment system before incorporating it into the final
                  edge-lining and stretching design. The strength of the nylon
                  Velcro attachment as applied was calculated (with the help of
                  mechanical engineer Dr. Lukasz Bratasz) and shown to be well
                  over twice the shear strength that would be needed should the
                  painting ever be displayed as a ceiling, taking into account
                  both the weight of the canvas and an average stretching
                  tension of 270&nbsp;N/m.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fifty-six looming strips, each 4 1/16 inches wide, were
                  fabricated to be placed 4 inches apart around the
                  circumference of the painting. The strips were cut from
                  polyester sailcloth. At one end, where the strip was to be
                  attached to the painting, two layers of Beva 371 film were
                  adhered and the edge pinked. Four-inch-wide “loop side” Velcro
                  (Loop 1000) was sewn to the opposite end of the strips to
                  attach the painting to the strainer. Nylon Velcro was selected
                  over polyester Velcro because of its demonstrated use in
                  conservation and longer cycle life.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The looming strips were attached while the painting was
                  faceup. Strip placement was guided by the use of a cardboard
                  template, to ensure the attached strips established a radial
                  line of tension from the center of the painting outwards
                  ([<strong>fig. 24.3</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/24-Schwarz/Schwarz/fig-24-3)).
                  To minimize flexing of the canvas support and to avoid
                  applying heat to the easily burnished paint film, a flexible
                  silicone heating mat was assembled using a commercially
                  available product and basic wiring. Wired to a standard plug
                  and connected to a rheostat for regulating the temperature,
                  the mat could be slipped underneath the painting and looming
                  strip to activate the Beva adhesive. The temperature of the
                  mat and the surface of the painting were monitored with an
                  infrared noncontact thermometer, and the rheostat could be
                  adjusted accordingly. During Beva activation from the back of
                  the painting, a metal plate cushioned with Volara and wrapped
                  with Marvelseal was used to apply gentle pressure from the
                  front and reflect heat back toward the painting. After the
                  Beva was activated, the strips were cooled under a cushioned
                  metal plate and weights.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The looming strips were attached 2 inches in from the tacking
                  edge, over the tacking edge, and 2 inches past the tacking
                  edge. The strips were not attached to the full length of the
                  wide fold-over edges, as this was deemed unnecessary and some
                  areas of canvas shrinkage prevented it. Rare earth magnets,
                  cushioned with blotter and wrapped in Tyvek for easier
                  removal, were used to prevent flexing of the unattached
                  tacking margins when the painting was placed upright.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The aluminum strainer was prepared by attaching the hook side
                  of the Velcro (Hook 88) to both the side edges and verso with
                  West Systems marine epoxy, providing two points of contact for
                  the looming strips. Temporary cardboard supports were
                  fabricated to level the front of the strainer so that the
                  painting would not slump during stretching. These pizza
                  slice–shape cardboard inserts were removable from the back.
                  The painting was gently slid onto the strainer and stretched
                  face up with the Velcro looming strips—a process that,
                  remarkably, took only a matter of minutes. This attachment
                  system allows for minor adjustments to tension around the
                  circle. Once stretched, the 14-foot loomed painting was placed
                  upright on a large in-house fabricated easel, repurposed from
                  another project (see [<strong>fig. 24.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/24-Schwarz/Schwarz/fig-24-1)).

                <h3 id="humidification" tabindex="-1">Humidification</h3>
                <p>
                  Following looming, planar deformations and creases were
                  resolved through humidification and drying under pressure.
                  This step was completed with the painting upright, enabling
                  access to the front and back of the work and allowing
                  conservators to monitor the painting’s surface. Upright
                  humidification also allowed the painting to be periodically
                  retensioned with the looming strips as the canvas deformations
                  relaxed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Three clear vertical panels composed of polycarbonate sheet
                  stabilized with wooden frames were fabricated to provide a
                  surface for the front of the painting during upright
                  humidification ([<strong>fig. 24.4</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/24-Schwarz/Schwarz/fig-24-4)).
                  These panels were easily adjusted and movable using
                  photographic light stands and adapted easels. The panels were
                  covered in silicone-release Mylar and positioned against the
                  face of the painting to provide a stable working surface
                  during treatment. Damp blotters were positioned on the verso
                  of the canvas and layered with Mylar and a metal plate. As one
                  conservator held the blotter and metal plate in place, a
                  colleague applied rare earth magnets to the panel on the
                  front. The strength and number of magnets could be adjusted to
                  apply variable amounts of pressure to the canvas and
                  blotter.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  The clear panels allowed conservators to monitor the front of
                  the painting ([<strong>fig. 24.5</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/24-Schwarz/Schwarz/fig-24-5)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The canvas responded well to this system of controlled
                  humidification. Conservators found that ten-minute exposures
                  to a damp blotter, followed by controlled drying under dry
                  blotters—forty-minute cycles of dry blotters switched three
                  times—resolved many planar deformations. In areas where canvas
                  creases and folds caused tented paint, a suction platen was
                  used concurrently to coax the deformed paint layers into
                  plane.

                  Modifications to the Original Strainer and Edge Lining
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Due to its large size, <em>The Hours</em> needed to be either
                  rolled for travel and stretched at each venue or stretched
                  onto a custom-built folding stretcher able to be shipped in
                  its folded orientation. Fortuitously, the original wooden
                  strainer, long dissociated from the painting, was discovered
                  in YUAG’s architectural fragments collection months before the
                  treatment began. Conservators decided to reunite the painting
                  with its original strainer for the exhibition of this work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Abbey sometimes used folding stretchers for other
                  paintings, such as <em>Columbus in the New World</em> (1906)
                  in the YUAG collection, the strainer for
                  <em>The Hours</em> disassembles into two half circles for
                  transport. It is composed of six curved outer members joined
                  together with bridle joints. The strainer was constructed to
                  fit together in two halves along two long crossbars. The two
                  halves were likely originally secured together with metal
                  hardware, but the hardware and crossbars no longer survived
                  and had to be reconstructed in house.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  The newly constructed middle crossbars join together
                  lengthwise with a series of heavy gauge bed bolts and threaded
                  crescent washers, as well as biscuits for positioning.
                  Additional heavy mending plates are used to reinforce all
                  joins. Before stretching the painting, the original strainer
                  was cleaned with cosmetic sponges, and minor splits were
                  repaired with hide glue. Several damages to the perimeter of
                  the strainer were filled with Araldite epoxy putty to ensure a
                  smooth fold-over edge.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The decision to use the original strainer requires that the
                  painting travel on a roller and be restretched at both
                  exhibition venues. To restretch the painting as noninvasively
                  as possible at each venue, and encouraged by the success of
                  the looming strips, conservators decided to use a nylon Velcro
                  attachment for the final stretching. The softer, loop side of
                  the Velcro is attached to an edge lining, with the hook side
                  attached to a Dibond panel screwed into the back face of the
                  strainer. The two halves of the strainer were loose-lined with
                  Trevira CS fabric to lend additional support to the canvas and
                  provide a surface on which to unroll and stretch the painting
                  during installation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Edge lining was pursued to provide additional support to the
                  tacking edges during stretching and unstretching and to serve
                  as a means by which the painting could be attached with Velcro
                  to the strainer. Mock-ups indicated that the circular shape of
                  the painting, its wide fold-over edges, and the extra bulk
                  from the Velcro would present several challenges during
                  stretching. Conservators aimed to design an edge-lining system
                  that would not add significant bulk to the edges of the
                  painting, as it might become a hinderance during rolling.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To minimize excess material, the edge-lining was designed to
                  take the form of segments, or strips, rather than one
                  continuous piece of canvas. Edge-lining strips were designed
                  to fit around the circumference of the circle and have tabs
                  that fold over the back of the strainer. Twenty-four strips
                  were constructed from Trevira CS fabric, Beva 371 film, and
                  6-inch-wide loop-side Velcro (Loop 1100) ([<strong>fig. 24.6</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/24-Schwarz/Schwarz/fig-24-6)).
                  The strips were designed to attach to the entire diameter of
                  the tacking edge and 3 inches behind the face of the painting,
                  providing continuous support around the edge of the work. To
                  avoid creating excess bulk at the fold-over edges, the strips
                  were designed with three tapered Velcro tabs calculated to fit
                  together with no overlap when folded around and attached to
                  the back of the strainer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using the ideal geometric measurements of the painting, a CAD
                  design for the edge lining was developed and, with the help of
                  a CNC unit, a template was cut from acrylic sheet.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  The template was traced onto the fabric, ensuring that the
                  Trevira warp direction was always oriented radially from the
                  center of the painting to the center of the middle tab. Two
                  layers of Beva 371 film were applied to one side of the edge
                  lining strips and the interior edge was pinked. Three strips
                  of 6-inch-wide loop-side Velcro were sewn with heavy duty
                  polyester thread to the tabs on the opposite end of the
                  edge-lining strip. To assist with the sewing process, the
                  Velcro was first tacked in place with one layer of Beva 371
                  film.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The loomed painting was placed face down onto a fresh bed of
                  blotter and tissue for the edge-lining attachment. The looming
                  strips were removed incrementally with a tacking iron, and the
                  edge-lining strips were attached side by side, also with a
                  warm tacking iron. Conservators used tacking irons of several
                  different sizes and shapes to ensure that the edge-lining
                  strips were well adhered to existing canvas folds and creases
                  along the tacking edges. The Trevira conformed well to these
                  small deformations. After attachment, the strips were cooled
                  under metal plates and weight. Additional strips of Velcro
                  were used to attach the edge lining tabs to the aluminum loom,
                  allowing the painting to remain under tension during most of
                  the edge-lining process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The 6-inch-wide hook-side Velcro (Hook 89) was attached to the
                  back of the strainer by epoxying the Velcro to four curved
                  pieces of Dibond aluminum composite panel. Attaching the
                  Velcro to the panel rather than directly to the strainer
                  presented several advantages: The aluminum panel, cut to match
                  the shape of the strainer and to bridge the bridle joints,
                  served to further stabilize the strainer. And adhering the
                  Velcro to the panel rather than directly to the strainer
                  protected original chalk markings, inscriptions, and labels.
                  The panel pieces were secured to the strainer with several
                  strategically placed screws.

                <p>
                  In a carefully planned series of steps to prepare for
                  stretching, the edge-lined painting was unloomed and the
                  aluminum strainer removed ([<strong>fig. 24.7</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/24-Schwarz/Schwarz/fig-24-7))
                  The two halves of the original wooden strainer were then
                  placed on the verso of the painting to ensure a close fit.
                  After it was ensured the painting would fit onto its strainer,
                  the two halves of the strainer were loose-lined with Trevira
                  CS fabric, and the painting was successfully stretched onto
                  its strainer using the Velcro edge-lining.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, treatment was halted on this
                  painting for most of 2020, and it progressed slowly to
                  accommodate social distancing guidelines. With the structural
                  treatment nearly complete, the next steps include surface
                  cleaning, filling losses with a flexible material, retouching,
                  fabrication of a travel roller, working with fabricators to
                  construct a modular frame, navigating the logistics of
                  international travel, and, finally, ensuring the painting is
                  housed appropriately in long-term storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This treatment has been and continues to be a product of a
                  team of conservators, fellows, interns, engineers, curators,
                  fabricators, and consultants from across the museum and Yale
                  University community. The complex treatments associated with
                  this exhibition have led to technical innovation, as
                  conservators have striven for minimally interventive
                  approaches that enable the international travel and display of
                  Abbey’s delicate, untouched works for the first time.
                  Treatments have also facilitated the in-depth study of Abbey’s
                  unique painting technique and materials, contributing to an
                  increased understanding of the working practice of American
                  and British mural painters at the turn of the twentieth
                  century.

                As part of a master’s program, the author examined a recently acquired collection of contemporary Congolese paintings at the Africa Museum in Tervuren, Belgium. After describing the context in which the paintings were made and their methods of production, often involving the use of unconventional materials, this paper considers the challenges for the collection’s long-term safe handling, display, and storage. Possible approaches to its conservation are considered, including the use of transparent linings, as many of the paintings have important information on the reverse. Different techniques for transparent linings were researched. A representative treatment case study, where an appropriate transparent lining was required, is presented.

                <h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1">Introduction</h2>
          <p>As part of the master’s program at the École supérieure des Arts (ESA) Saint Luc University in Liege, I had the opportunity to research the collection of contemporary Congolese paintings at the Africa Museum in Tervuren, Belgium. This unique collection of two thousand paintings, including works by well-known artists such as Ange Kumbi, Chéri Samba, Tshibumba, Shula, Moke, Chéri Cherin, Thango, and Lubaki, chronicles the lives of Congolese citizens from 1968 to 2012. They were collected by Bogumil Jewsiewicki-Koss<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> and purchased in 2012 by the Africa Museum.</p>
          <p>The first year of my master’s thesis focused on historical research and the assessment of the recently acquired collection, including entering details of inscriptions and condition into a database. The main objective was to gain an understanding of the overall condition of the collection. This eclectic collection consists of paintings made with both typical and local recycled materials. The second year of my thesis involved the research of appropriate structural treatments to preserve the paintings for the future. (This led me to the studio of Olivier Nouaille<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> to follow Marion Guillermin’s research on Petex and Nitex, synthetic, transparent canvases ([[Guillermin 2012]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> Many of the paintings have inscriptions on the back, making the transparency of the lining materials a primary concern. A range of test samples were made and tested with synthetic adhesives, and the most promising results were used to treat one of the paintings in the collection.</p>
          <p>This article is divided into three main sections. The first introduces the collection—its historical background, themes, and materials. The second outlines the collection’s current condition. The third describes the treatment of one painting and its lining onto a transparent support.</p>
          <h2 id="the-collection" tabindex="-1">The Collection</h2>
          <h3 id="popular-art%E2%80%94art-about-people" tabindex="-1">Popular Art—Art about People</h3>
          <p>The term <em>popular art</em> comes from me; it’s to say that our artwork is about the people’s lives and will always be understood by everyone wherever they come from. You don’t have to have been in academic school, because the message is direct and easy to understand. I wish I would have found a better word, because after a few years I realized that it was misunderstood. In the Western world, this word <em>popular</em> has another meaning, without any thoughts behind it, something without any research, and I was upset about it, because there is a research! Concerning the paintings, I’d like that everyone looks at the paintings without any judgment, prejudice, or anything and wherever they come from.</p>
          <p>—Chéri Samba ([[Our Choices Art 2017]])</p>
          <p>Congolese popular art originated from street advertising art (billboards) which began to appear in the late 1910s to early 1920s. The artists Lubaki and Djilatendo, whose work was noticed by gallerists in 1926, used natural pigments on the walls of houses that were made with clay and leaves. Unfortunately, these pictures didn’t last, due to the fragile supports and materials chosen. They were painted to publicize stores or to denounce something in particular: painful, moral, and historical events that had caused concern. The biggest production of mural art was in Kinshasa. Through this art, the city—known as “Kin trash can” because of the quantity of waste materials found in the street—was revitalized.</p>
          <p>The popular mural artists were encouraged to paint on canvases instead of the walls of houses, and that was the beginning of easel paintings in Congo. They were displayed in front of houses to attract clients. Once sold, the paintings were usually nailed to walls in bars or houses, and each painting sold funded the purchases of new painting materials.</p>
          <p>Because the paintings were now portable, they were also able to travel around the world. Their inclusion in the Universal Exhibition of Brussels in 1958 attracted wide interest both locally and abroad. The Congolese became more aware of the importance of taking care of and conserving their paintings. At this time, the artists began to sign their artworks, and many exhibitions were organized to display these fascinating paintings throughout the United States and Europe. Concurrently, several academies of art were established.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>
          <p>In the south of the country, the French artist Pierre Romain Desfossés (1887–1954) created the Elisabethville<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup> School in 1946. Bela, a famous artist, was its first member. This was more a studio than a school, where everyone was free to paint what they wanted. Twenty years after the discovery of Lubaki, the precursor, Desfossés created the Hangar School with other well-known artists such as Pili-Pili, Mwenze, and Kibwanga. Desfossés died in 1954, and the Hangar fused with the Academy of Fine Arts of Lubumbashi.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>The Belgian artist Victor Wallenda (Frere Marc-Stanislaus) created the Saint-Luc School in 1943, in the western part of Congo. In 1948, the artist Laurent Moonens (1911–1991) arrived from Belgium, and the Saint Luc School moved to Leopoldville (now Kinshasa). In 1957, it was renamed the Academy of Fine Arts.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Farther north, in Brazzaville, the French collector Pierre Lods created the Poto Poto School in 1949.</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>As a result of these different schools, two categories of artists appeared: the self-educated and the academically educated. These artists were put under the spotlight by many patrons ([[Gilungula Pela Koy 1995]]; [[Turine 2007]]).</p>
          <h3 id="ongoing-research" tabindex="-1">Ongoing Research</h3>
          <p>Jewsiewicki-Koss published extensively on Congolese art in the 1990s during his trips to many cities, including Kinshasa, Bunia, and Lubumbashi. He noted that the cities looked like huge art galleries of paintings. Three documentaries describing the artists’ working conditions were made: two by Jewsiewicki-Koss in 1991, and one by the Flemish film director Dirk Dumont in 1989. Prints of these documentaries are stored in the Africa Museum in Tervuren, Belgium.</p>
          <p>While many other relevant publications about Congolese popular art exist, I found few studies and little research focusing on the exact type of materials used and the deterioration of these paintings. The Africa Museum’s collection was only recently acquired, and as there had been no prior condition assessments, I had the opportunity to take a closer look. I recorded the extent of the damage to the paintings in a database to focus any research on future conservation. My desire was to provide a conservation approach based on materials, rather than primarily theoretical art history.</p>
          <p>To learn more about the deterioration of the collection, I needed more information about the materials these artists used and their techniques: How did they work? How did they choose their materials? Why did they choose these types of canvases? How did they apply their mixtures, and in which order? How did they view their artwork? What were their purpose and expectations? To answer these questions and others, I interviewed Jewsiewicki-Koss ([[Debarax 2016]]), the previous owner, and Ange Kumbi,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup> one of the famous artists represented in the collection. It was essential for me to understand the collection before undertaking the research.</p>
          <h3 id="themes-in-the-collection" tabindex="-1">Themes in the Collection</h3>
          <p>I was mimicking comic scenes. There was a magazine that everyone loved called <em>Jeunes pour jeunes</em>, and I would copy scenes from it and sell the drawings to my friends at school. But I told myself that drawing didn’t allow me to earn much more money, so maybe I should do painting. Editors were looking for somebody who used a style that could be found in billboards in their paintings, and what I was doing was putting writing in my paintings.</p>
          <p>I named this kind of style the Sambain style. It meant paintings with writing. It seems that before me, such paintings didn’t exist. Each of us has to have a specific style and be considered as a model, and my aim was to make what hasn’t been made before. I noticed that people who were walking in the street didn’t stop to look at the paintings, so I had to find a way to catch people’s attention, to be more attractive. The real connoisseurs, my audience, was in the street. Especially those who stood in front of my paintings for a long time. If they read more slowly than me, they would stay a lot of time in front of it, so it was a success! What I’m interested in is to call conscience to mind and to give a moral meaning. I paint a reality that everybody knows. If it leads me to getting arrested because I tell the truth, it doesn’t upset me, because this is what I want to paint.</p>
          <p>—Chéri Samba ([[Our Choices Art 2017]])</p>
          <p>The museum’s collection features famous self-educated artists such as Ange Kumbi, Chéri Samba, Tshibumba Shula, Moke, Cheri Cherin, as well as others from the Academy of Fine Arts, including Thango and Lubaki. The paintings by self-educated artists depict historical and moral topics ([<strong>fig. 25.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/25-Desbarax/fig-25-1)) as well as the daily life of the Congolese. The subjects represent the real lives of people: colonialism, prostitution, scenes of violence, AIDS and other diseases, political views, and the opinions, feelings, and sensitivities of people, as well as moments of daily life—a visit to the hairdresser, an argument between a husband and his wife, a battle against mosquitoes, and many more quotidian scenes. They also show the humor in some situations.</p>
          <p>The artists used very bright swaths of colors and painted pictures that expressed their own feelings and life experiences. Their messages were clear and direct, and they expressed themselves very simply to make sure that everyone could understand. This popular art is more experimental—and entirely opposed to—academic art, which has many rules and requires formal training. In contrast, the artists who graduated from academies preferred to paint botanical and animal subjects.</p>
          <h3 id="materials-and-condition" tabindex="-1">Materials and Condition</h3>
          <h4 id="several-supports" tabindex="-1">Several supports</h4>
          <p>You know the working conditions were very bad before. I couldn’t buy any canvases in art stores, because it was too expensive. I bought empty flour sacks with the money I got from working in serigraphy for a company.</p>
          <p>—Ange Kumbi<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup></p>
          <p>I learned from Jewsiewicki-Koss that the artists had to sell a few paintings a week to survive. Their clients were poor. Jewsiewicki-Koss compared the price of a painting to the price of a few beers. This limited artists’ choice in materials to what they could afford. They worked outside or in indoor areas, mostly using discarded materials that were found locally ([[Debarax 2016]]).</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>The supports used in the collection varied from flour sacks and other used fabrics like curtains or tablecloths to torn clothing such as jeans. They were made from different types of yarn: cotton, flax, or hemp, of different thicknesses, density, colors, and states of preservation. There are both small and large-size formats.</p>
          <p>It is impressive that the backs of the paintings contain so much important historical information ([<strong>fig. 25.2</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/25-Desbarax/fig-25-2))—and sometimes the faces does as well—showing dates, inscriptions about the purchase, patterns, and brand details such as the trademark on flour sacks. Often the canvas was crudely repaired by the artists, to strengthen the support before painting on it. When the support was already damaged and weakened, these tears form an integral part of the paintings. Fortunately, the unstretched paintings are now preserved in a stable environment and stored flat in large drawers.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h4 id="paint-layer-and-techniques" tabindex="-1">Paint layer and techniques</h4>
          <p>I stretched the flour sack during the process, and I put one or two layers of cold glue and let it dry. The second layer was a layer of house paint, which was watercolor. The meditation could start at this time; it wasn’t easy to find a subject. I sang and went into a trance sometimes to be in my own world. When I’m inspired with a good theme it’s like a gift, I’m so glad when it comes to me. I drew some shapes with a pencil, and after that, I used my brushes and painted with some inks found at the printer shop. It took a few months to finish a painting, because I liked to paint slowly, and with the inks it needed a few layers to be bright enough.”</p>
          <p>—Ange Kumbi<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup></p>
          <p>According to Jewsiewicki-Koss ([[Debarax 2016]]) a few artists made their own brushes and strainers. A painting without a strainer is cheaper, so many of the paintings were unstretched. They didn’t use varnish because it was too expensive. Apparently, some artists also used manioc flour mixed with water to make a ground layer, but often this coat cracked very quickly. Jewsiewicki-Koss reported that sometimes the artists made their own mixtures composed of acrylic or gouache, most likely house paint and maybe other unknown constituents added to palm oil. They mixed paint in pails and freely and quickly applied it to the canvas, the edges of which often show drips of paint. Paint layers were either thinly applied or had thick layers of impasto. Often the paint layer penetrated through the canvas due to the lack of a ground layer or because of the thinness of the support.</p>
          <p>By the way, I never tried to make my own brushes, because I bought them at the art store, not even the paint mixture with manioc flour or oil palm as Bogumil told. The famous artists, such as Moke, Bodo, Cheri Cherin, and others from the Academy of Fine Arts used the same paint found at the printer shop.”</p>
          <p>—Ange Kumbi<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>
          <p>The heterogeneous mixture they used looked plastic and grainy. The artists, in particular Chéri Samba, occasionally added fabrics with patterns or glitter that was stuck onto the paint layer. Since their aim was to spread a message, they didn’t prioritize longevity in choosing their materials or focus on how the paintings were conserved or stored.</p>
          <p>The most important thing was the image, and everyone knew that the paintings lasted just a few years. When the paintings became too damaged, they were discarded.</p>
          <p>—Bogumil Jewsiewicki-Koss ([[Debarax 2016]])</p>
          <h2 id="the-collection%E2%80%99s-state-of-deterioration" tabindex="-1">The Collection’s State of Deterioration</h2>
          <p>It was expensive to exhibit my work in galleries, so I often had to display my paintings at the famous Bikeko market in Kinshasa-Gombe. The paintings were exposed to the hot sun the whole day, and the problem is that the inks I used weren’t resistant to the sunlight, so the paint cracked very quickly. I think that was the reason behind the accelerated deterioration of the paint.</p>
          <p>Ange Kumbi<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup></p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>The consistent features of these artists’ technique are that the supports are used without any preparation, and they are often frayed; the ground layer is a mixture that cracks quickly; and the paint layer is ink from a printer or composed of a heterogeneous mixture of house paint, palm oil, and other compounds. This combination has considerable potential for rapid degradation. To date, my observations are based on close visual examination, but this has led to a better understanding of the damage. Due to the diverse techniques and materials found, each of the paintings is unique and the alterations and the effects of deterioration differ greatly.</p>
          <p>The paintings have aged and changed quickly over time. They are ephemeral, which is understandable considering the artists’ intent was simply to spread their message and communicate with people through their art. However, this poses a real problem for conservation due to the use of recycled materials, which are not designed to be stable over time and not strong enough to support the variable movement of the materials during handling and climate fluctuations.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3 id="supports" tabindex="-1">Supports</h3>
          <p>Supports were used as found and contain a lot of dust and grime. There are surface distortions, sagging, and loosening. There are corner draws and tension cusping. The edges and corners are frayed. The artists used what they could find for the canvas, and so the substrates are damaged from the beginning, many with significant tears. All these tears are made worse by frequent transportation and repetitive blows. There are a few networks of punctures and holes from nails. Generally, supports were not strong enough to support the weight of the painting.</p>

          <p>The materials used in the paintings are not compatible enough to construct a stable painting. The composition and the conditions of the layers cause many issues, such as significant adhesion deterioration, leading to a loss of pictorial matter. The artists often painted on a canvas that was not cleaned before use and sometimes lacked a ground layer, so the paint layer didn’t adhere well to the support or underlayers. There are many cracks in the paint layer and over the many seams as well. It is possible that those cracks are due to the mixtures used or to numerous movements during handling of the painting. Abrasions can be observed on the surface, as well as imperfections such as stains, drips, and grime. There are many lacunae as well as flaking, powdering, or lifting—suggesting the paint mixture is probably underbound. As with much contemporary art, the conservation of such paintings is challenging and requires a new approach, in contrast to more traditional works where there is a series of layers that function more or less predictably and respond consistently to treatment.</p>
          <h3 id="treatment-proposals" tabindex="-1">Treatment Proposals</h3>
          <p>The origin of the supports, frequent transportation, and poor handling of the paintings have caused serious tears and cracks. Often, the canvases were hung with nails in bars and houses, and they were moved without precaution. The artists exhibited the paintings on stretchers in front of their houses, and after the sale, they removed the stretcher and rolled up the canvases to be transported. Afterward, these paintings were not kept in a stable environment.</p>
          <p>We know that there is never a standard recipe or procedure for treating a painting, and we are constantly being introduced to new materials, techniques, and insights to preserve them for the future. We also know that contemporary art conservation can be different from traditional forms of conservation. The paintings in this collection were not designed to last, and I noticed that the collection was in desperate need of conservation. The main challenge for the conservation of ephemeral art is devising a treatment that will avoid changing the appearance of the artwork, which presents a huge range of issues. Many of the paintings have an adhesion problem that requires consolidation, and others need a strip-lining or a lining to stabilize the whole painting.</p>
          <p>During my study, and after seeing the extent of the damage, I decided to focus my research on structural conservation in hopes of finding a suitable lining. The lining is necessary for the safe handling of these paintings for a loan—or even to remove the canvas from the sliding drawer for examination—and is essential to enable their future transportation. I selected one of the paintings in the collection, <em>Mami Wata</em> by Nkulu Tommy Emman, because it had a paint layer still in a good state, which allowed me to focus on a unique problem: the consolidation of the support.</p>
          <h2 id="case-study%3A-mami-wata-by-nkulu-tommy-emman" tabindex="-1">Case Study: <em>Mami Wata</em> by Nkulu Tommy Emman</h2>
          <p>The painting chosen from the collection is a depiction of the water spirit Mami Wata ([<strong>fig. 25.3</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/25-Desbarax/fig-25-3)) dating from 1960. It is signed by Nkulu Tommy Emman, an unknown artist. Jewsiewicki-Koss said that the name Nkulu was used by many painters, and it was a common name in Lubumbashi. The artists changed their signatures frequently, which makes attributions complicated. This painting might have been bought by a Congolese owner, probably in the Kasumbalesa market in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mami Wata is the goddess of rivers, revered in Congo, other parts of Africa, and in Haiti and Brazil—and feared by fishermen. In the painting she looks like a European mermaid, with white skin and blue eyes, the temptress of Western luxury, her idealistic beauty further signified pictorially by her wristwatch and jewelry.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>The painting is executed on a thin cotton support patterned with flowers and measures 83 x 54 cm. Some information is written on the back: numbers, details of acquisitions, and notes ([<strong>fig. 25.4</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/25-Desbarax/fig-25-4)). The paint layer appears to be acrylic that was thinly applied. There is no ground layer, varnish, or stretcher. It is currently stored and laid flat in a sliding drawer.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3 id="state-of-preservation" tabindex="-1">State of Preservation</h3>
          <p>A large area of the support was missing from the upper right corner, making handling a difficult problem. There were also many rusted punctures due to the nails used to hang it. The edges and corners were frayed. There were some small tears to mend, lacunae in the paint layer, and some surface imperfections on the front side. The painting was grimy, there were a lot of cracks, and the canvas was distorted. The painting needed to be cleaned and lined (see [<strong>fig. 25.4</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/25-Desbarax/fig-25-4)). The fact that we needed to keep the inscriptions on the back visible precipitated my research into transparent lining.</p>
          <h3 id="transparent-lining%3A-past-and-continuing-research" tabindex="-1">Transparent Lining: Past and Continuing Research</h3>
          <p>Some of the past research about transparent lining provided me with valuable information. In Knut Nicolaus’s book, we read that in 1961 Boissonnas<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup> proposed the use of fiberglass with a wax-resin lining or with Beva 371 ([[Nicolaus 1999]]). But fiberglass has some disadvantages: it is not stretchy enough, and it is almost impossible to repair holes or damage to the substrate. In 1981, Pacoud-Reme, with “three types of transparent linings done by G.&nbsp;Ten Kate for the paintings for the National Museum,” tested the fiberglass canvas with wax resin and a rigid support of methyl methacrylate ([[Pacoud-Reme 1981]]). In 1996, Berger referenced different kinds of synthetic canvases, such as Pe-Cap (polyester monofilament screen), but they were not transparent enough ([[Berger 1996]]).</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>In 2015, I followed the research by Marion Guillermin at Olivier Nouaille’s studio in Paris ([[Guillermin 2012]]). She used Petex<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup> (polyester PET) and Nitex<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup> (nylon PA), synthetic canvases that are monofilament open mesh fabrics from Sefar Inc.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup> From the material properties provided by the manufacturer, both are stable in solvents. For abrasion and alkaline resistance, Nitex is better, whereas Petex is more resistant to acid. Unfortunately, their stability to light exposure is poor. However, the synthetic canvases are thin, elastic, easy to use, and almost completely transparent. Guillermin tested them with natural glue, but she didn’t apply her tests to real paintings.</p>
          <p>For the paintings in the Africa Museum’s collection, I eliminated natural adhesives and traditional canvases due to their yellowing tendency and their lack of transparency, opting for the Sefar synthetic canvases and synthetic adhesives. The aim was to find a lining with the necessary compatibility with the materials used in the paintings. The lining fabric had to be transparent, reversible, resistant to solvents, elastic, and inert (like Petex and Nitex), and the adhesive needed to be stable and reversible, transparent after drying, and easy to apply, such as Beva 371 Film (65&nbsp;µm) or Plextol B500 synthetic adhesive. One of the issues was to find a technique that did not smudge the ink on the back of the painting.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3 id="accelerated-aging-and-tensile-tests" tabindex="-1">Accelerated Aging and Tensile Tests</h3>
          <p>Some samples were made in cotton with inscriptions written on the back in different types of ink to imitate the original painting. Some of these were adhered with Plextol B500 and others with Beva 371 Film, and onto both Petex and Nitex. To control and assess the stability and sustainability of the materials for the lining, the samples were tested using Climacell accelerated aging equipment and through tensile testing with a dynamometer. The Climacell equipment simulates environmental conditions, and I chose to run the tests with 55% relative humidity at 70°C over two weeks. Conducting these tests in extreme conditions—beyond what is normally recommended in conservation—allows us to quickly observe ambient changes due to heat and moisture.</p>
          <p>After the period of exposure in the Climacell, noticeable changes were observed in dimensions, such as shrinkage, and change in appearance, such as yellowing, uncontrolled peeling, cracking, blistering, and other alterations. The results showed that Plextol B500 is not stable enough: the adhesive peeled off the canvas and air bubbles formed between adhesives and substrate. Beva 371 Film stayed stable and uniform but yellowed slightly. With both adhesives, Nitex shrank slightly more than Petex. For the tensile tests, Plextol B500 on Nitex was more resistant; however, when I tested Nitex and Petex without adhesive and cotton, Petex was the most resistant. These convincing results helped me to choose Petex as a lining fabric for its good stability and strength, with Beva 371 Film as adhesive for its good tackiness and uniformity. The painting was treated based on these results.</p>
          <h3 id="treatment-of-the-painting" tabindex="-1">Treatment of the Painting</h3>
          <p>To prepare for the lining, the face of the painting was treated (see [<strong>fig. 25.3</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/25-Desbarax/fig-25-3)). The first step was to smooth out local distorted areas using moisture, pressure, and heat, in particular on the face and around the edges. Afterward, I removed the dirt and dust and cleaned the paint layer with swabs moistened with demineralized water. The reverse was cleaned with a dry latex sponge.</p>
          <p>For the lining, I laid the Petex on the hot table with one layer of Beva 371 Film (65&nbsp;µ), cut to the same dimensions as the painting. These two coats were heated for 25 minutes at 65°C then I let them cool down to seal them. Next, I carefully positioned the original painting on the synthetic layers (Petex and Beva 371 Film) and heated it at the same temperature and for the same duration. This treatment was successful. The lining is thin, easy to apply, transparent, and resistant to degradation over time (<strong>[figs. 25.5](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/25-Desbarax/fig-25-5), [25.6](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/25-Desbarax/fig-25-6)</strong>).</p>
          <p>As a last step, I continued with the restoration: filling lacuna with the synthetic compound Modostuc and texturing some of the losses. The retouches were made with Gamblin Conservation Colors. From now on, the painting can be handled safely and easily. The support is consolidated, and the extra layer supports the whole painting without hiding the inscriptions ([<strong>fig. 25.7</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/25-Desbarax/fig-25-7)).</p>
          <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>The Africa Museum’s collection is a fascinating and interesting study due to the many characteristics and issues involved. The most important problem to solve was safe handling, which is why the research concentrated on the structural treatment. The trial samples in cotton made with the transparent canvases Petex and Nitex, Plextol B500, and Beva 371 Film were assessed using accelerated aging and tensile tests to discover the strength and the sustainability of these materials. Beva 371 Film with Petex showed good properties. The results obtained were determined through the treatment of one of the paintings from the collection, and it worked very well.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>As this conservation treatment was unusual and atypical, this research allowed me to question my views on traditional methods of conservation and restoration. It also underlined the importance of painting materials and the importance of handling artworks with care for their future preservation. Today, restoring contemporary art is all about research and innovation, and we will always have to battle with ethics to find the best way to restore a painting. It was challenging to treat this ephemeral painting, and I gave it my best.</p>

                  The church of Saint Francis of Assisi Atizapan, located in the
                  Mexican state of Mexico, houses a series of
                  mid-eighteenth-century easel paintings made in the Viceroyalty
                  of New Spain representing eleven apostles, Saint Paul, Christ,
                  and the Virgin Mary. The paintings all correspond with each
                  other aesthetically and technically. The paintings were

                <p>
                  A series of mid-eighteenth-century easel paintings depicting
                  eleven apostles, Saint Paul, Christ, and the Virgin Mary,
                  housed in the church of Saint Francis of Assisi Atizapan, in
                  the Mexican state of Mexico, were restored in 2018. This
                  afforded the authors the opportunity to study the set of
                  paintings in depth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The paintings, which appear to be the work of a single artist,
                  date from Mexico’s Viceregal period, and it is important to
                  consider them in that context. The Spanish arrived in the
                  Mexican territory in 1519, and two years later conquered the
                  Aztec empire. In 1524, the Franciscans reached the
                  Americas—starting the Catholic evangelization process in the
                  former Aztec capital of Mexico-Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City)
                  and surrounding territories ([[López Mora 2011|, 14]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Immediately after their arrival, the Franciscans started the
                  evangelizing to the north of Mexico City, reaching the lands
                  of Tlalnepantla, where they constructed their first church—the
                  Church of the Corpus Christi—in the 1530s. About ten chapels
                  that belonged to the Corpus Christi church were built some
                  decades later. One of them was the chapel of San Francis of
                  Assisi Atizapan, although the first chapel with that name was
                  later demolished. The current church of Saint Francis was
                  built in the 1750s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  That decade corresponds with the creation of the paintings,
                  which suggests that the Apostolate series was made for the new
                  church ([<strong>fig. 26.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/fig-26-1)). In addition to
                  these paintings, the church houses another group depicting
                  saints known as the Doctors of the Church, which was painted
                  by Carlos Clemente Lopez, a <em>cacique</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  artist active during eighteenth century ([[Ramírez Montes
                  2001]]|, 106).

                  The Apostolate Series
                </h2>
                <p>
                  We restored the apostolate easel paintings from June to
                  November of 2018, during which we were guided by the words of
                  Cesare Brandi: “The restoration—always understood in the
                  professional field—is the ideal methodological moment to ask
                  new questions to the works and, with it, add knowledge around
                  them” ([[Brandi 2000|, 6]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The opportunity to analyze a pictorial set painted by a single
                  anonymous author—not just a single painting—was remarkable.
                  Among the advantages that a group of works such as this
                  presented us were summarized by conservator and researcher
                  Elsa Arroyo when she said, “The artistic process and the way
                  the materials were prepared for each strata of the paintings
                  are indicative factors of the tradition of every artist and
                  workshop of New Spain; therefore, technical studies are more
                  relevant when they consider analysis of pictorial series, from
                  the same artist or from the same context” ([[Arroyo Lemus
                  2017|, 42]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The series represents the apostles with the instruments of
                  their martyrdoms: Saint Peter, Saint Andrew, Saint James the
                  Greater, Saint James the Lesser, Saint Bartholomew, Saint
                  Philip, Saint John, Saint Jude Thaddeus, Saint Matthew, Saint
                  Simon, and Saint Thomas. In addition to the apostles, Saint
                  Paul, the Virgin Mary, and Jesus Christ were also painted.
                  After cleaning the paintings, we realized that each included a
                  part of the Apostles’ Creed. According to a legend based on
                  the Acts of the Apostles, while gathered for Pentecost, they
                  began to recite each of the articles of the Creed one by one
                  ([[Schäfer 1983|, 14]]) ([<strong>fig. 26.2</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/fig-26-2)). (In addition to
                  this series, a painting of Pentecost by Antonio de Torres
                  hangs in the church, completing the discourse, even though it
                  is the work of a different painter.)

                <p>
                  The paintings all correspond with each other aesthetically and
                  technically, and also share the same basic materials. In each
                  painting, the character appears full-length and occupying the
                  foreground and most of the composition. This type of
                  representation recalls the way in which the Spanish painter
                  Francisco de Zurbarán painted some of his characters, and it
                  stands as one of the key features inherited from the Spanish
                  pictorial tradition.

                  The artist began the composition and the coloring of the
                  paintings on the reddish iron oxide ground layer. The
                  brushstrokes are soft, and the artist used glazes in dark
                  tones and more painting in the light colors despite the fact
                  that the pictorial layer is very thin and has no impastos. As
                  well as these features, the way in which the compositions were
                  solved, along with the technical and pictorial sequence,
                  correspond to eighteenth-century painting production ([[Mues
                  Orts 2017|, 57]]). Among the material evidence that helped us
                  date the paintings is the presence of Prussian blue.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  Although it is unknown when the pigment was first used in New
                  Spain, a painting studied by the Diagnostic Laboratory of
                  Works of Art at the National University of Mexico evidenced
                  its presence by the mid-eighteenth century ([[Zavala Cabello
                  2013|, 144]]). This anonymous series is also similar in
                  painting technique to the works of contemporary artists such
                  as Miguel Cabrera, José de Alzibar, Francisco Vallejo, and
                  Patricio Morlete.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As some researchers have pointed out, information is lacking
                  about the practice of painters in documents, so approaching
                  the subject through material analysis is the best way to
                  expand knowledge of New Spanish artists’ techniques ([[Mues
                  Orts 2017|, 57]]). For this reason, during the restoration we
                  collected all the information we could about the paintings’
                  materials and technique: they have the same format and
                  measurements, stratigraphy—strainers, priming layers, color
                  layers, and varnishes—and chromatic palette. All the paintings
                  have a linen textile support attached with animal glue to the
                  edge of wooden strainers composed of five elements ([<strong>fig. 26.3</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/fig-26-3)). About 12 x 11
                  threads per square centimeter form the fabric, and there is a
                  Z-twist in the threads in both warp and weft ([<strong>fig. 26.4</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/fig-26-4)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also noted very specific information regarding the
                  technical and material challenges our mid-eighteenth-century
                  artist faced and solved, specifically the relation of the
                  textile support to other elements of the paintings, including
                  the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The artist used the same method for all the paintings to
                      attach the support to the strainer—using glue to adhere
                      the support to the edge—but in some paintings he had to
                      apply the original ground to the wood of the strainer to
                      level the edges, because the fabric did not reach the
                      outer edge of the strainer. This is painted over by the
                      artist, so this process gives us important information
                      that the painter painted directly onto the canvas fixed to
                      the permanent strainer. There are no extended edges in any
                      painting.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      He also had to stitch together two different pieces of
                      fabric to achieve the desired size to fit the strainer.
                      All the paintings measure 160 x 120 cm.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Twelve of the paintings have regular patterns of
                      perforations and marks made with iron gall ink ([<strong>fig. 26.5</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/fig-26-5)).
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      All the perforations and sewing were covered with
                      cotton-rag paper by the artist.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  After registering all these characteristics and doing
                  additional research, we realized that the analysis of canvases
                  had not been granted the importance it deserves. For example,
                  many invasive processes have been carried out unnecessarily,
                  such as wax-resin relining, practiced in Mexico since the
                  1970s, which resulted in important information being hidden or
                  lost. The same thing happened to the original strainers: in
                  almost every conservation treatment applied to a painting,
                  they were discarded and a new one was substituted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is also important to establish the context of the canvases
                  in New Spain as background, which refers back to the history
                  of canvases in Spain. Rocío Bruquetas, in her important book
                  <em>The Technique of Painting in the Spanish Golden Age,</em>
                  says that almost all the canvases used in Spain were imported
                  from Germany, France, and the Netherlands, although some
                  regions of Spain that produced linen, such as Galicia, el
                  Bierzo, and Medina de Rioseco ([[Bruquetas Galán 2007|,
                  104]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Panel painting was gradually replaced by easel painting
                  starting during the reign of Charles I (1516–1556), but
                  contracts and other documents are not very specific regarding
                  the material characteristics of the canvases. However, it is
                  possible to find allusions to certain processes, such as the
                  tension of the canvas to the frame or strainer and the
                  construction of corners and crossbars ([[Bruquetas Galán
                  2007|, 232, 248]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In late seventeenth century New Spain, some artists still
                  painted on wood panels, depending on the painting’s intended
                  placement. If it were to be placed in an altarpiece, a wood
                  panel would probably have been preferred. About such
                  preferences, the painters’ guild ordinances of 1587 mentioned
                  that canvases shouldn’t be reused and prohibited painting over
                  an existing painting ([[Carrillo y Gariel 1946|, 95]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  With regard specifically to canvases in Viceregal Mexico, the
                  art conservator Rita Sumano is the only person to have studied
                  in detail the canvases of New Spanish paintings. Her research
                  was enriched by the analysis of more than a hundred paintings
                  restored in the National School of Conservation. Thanks to her
                  research, we know now that almost all New Spanish canvases
                  from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were made from
                  linen ([[Sumano González 2010|, 4, 5]]). We also know that 13%
                  of the canvases analyzed from the eighteenth century have
                  patterns of perforations and, of that percentage, 40% do not
                  have selvages, which she interpreted as a sign of a lack of
                  materials ([[Sumano González 2010|, 33]]). Importantly, the
                  information we can obtain from the analysis of canvases also
                  gives us information about their origin, distribution, and the
                  loom that was used to make the textiles ([[Siracusano 2005|,
                  18]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trade between Spain and New Spain was fundamental in many
                  aspects. Textiles were exported from Spain and other parts of
                  Europe to New Spain, as were other materials, including
                  pigments, lacquers, oils, and brushes ([[Arroyo Lemus 2017|,
                  37]]). In the case of the canvases we studied, twelve of the
                  fourteen paintings have reused textile supports, evidenced by
                  the patterns of perforations and ferro-gallic ink marks
                  already mentioned. These features provide specific clues as to
                  the fabrics’ acquisition by the artist: as mentioned, the
                  paintings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Objects traded between Spain and New Spain were marked by the
                  cargador (importer). For example, lightweight sculptures made
                  of cornstalks from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in
                  New Spain are found in Spain. Pablo Amador found the mark of
                  the <em>cargador</em> who brought such a sculpture of Christ
                  from New Spain to Spain in 1673 ([[Amador Marrero 2012|,
                  744]]). Many goods at the time were transported in bales
                  wrapped in fabric (including linen), which were numbered and
                  marked with the importer’s initials. Artists obtained the
                  linen wrappings to use as the canvas supports for their
                  paintings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A painting entitled <em>The Customs Yard</em> from 1775 by
                  Nicolas-Bernard Lépicié, depicts traders with their
                  merchandise bundled in bales that have similar marks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  Another painting, one from the Basilica de la Virgen de la
                  Soledad in Oaxaca, painted in 1740, depicts an
                  <em>ex-voto</em> (votive offering) that expressed the donor’s
                  gratitude to the Virgin for her intercession after an
                  earthquake. The donor of this interesting painting was a
                  wealthy merchant, and, in accordance with his trade, the scene
                  takes place inside his house, where some marked bales lie on
                  the floor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In light of this evidence, we concluded that the canvases of
                  the Apostolate paintings were made from the linen coverings of
                  bales, which the artist bought to paint on. These merchant
                  marks are also found in other important New Spanish paintings,
                  such as the <em>Release of Saint Peter</em> by Pedro Ramirez
                  and Miguel Cabrera’s <em>Holy Family</em> (both in the
                  National Museum of the Viceroyalty), in others by Juan Correa,
                  and in other anonymous paintings, such as a Virgin of
                  Guadalupe from the Convent of Santa Brígida in Mexico City.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to the merchant marks, perforations in the
                  canvases are also related to the supports’ original use.
                  According to Paula Mues, “Repurposing canvases was also a
                  common practice, whether by painting over existing works or by
                  using fabrics that had defects or had been reclaimed from
                  industrial processes. This explains why we often find canvases
                  with a regular pattern of perforations, which were generally
                  repaired by covering the holes with pieces of paper” ([[Mues
                  Orts 2017]]|, 57).
                </p>
                <p>
                  These features provided the guidelines to the conservation
                  treatments applied to the canvases.
                </p>
                <h2 id="treatment" tabindex="-1">Treatment</h2>
                <p>
                  We started by cleaning the surface of the canvas by removing
                  dust and debris using a vacuum and brushes. Then we proceeded
                  to eliminate newer interventions on the canvases, such as
                  several patches made from different types and colors of
                  textiles. When we removed them, we realized many were not the
                  appropriate size, and some of weren’t even covering a hole or
                  tear but were just adhered to strengthen the surface. Over
                  some small holes we applied linen fibers with glue paste.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most of the canvases had deformations. To eliminate them, we
                  applied moisture and pressure, allowing it to return to its
                  original flat state.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The corrosive nature of the iron gall ink markings on the back
                  of the supports caused some deterioration and tears in the
                  textile. To care for this damage we had to find a method that
                  allowed for the stabilization of the canvas without covering
                  the information of the marks ([<strong>fig. 26.6a</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/fig-26-6)). We used silk
                  crepeline, with Beva as an adhesive. As a thin, transparent
                  textile with good mechanical resistance, the silk crepeline
                  made it possible to conserve both the materials and the
                  information ([<strong>fig. 26.6b</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/fig-26-6)).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  Finally, for the holes of the paintings without iron-gall ink
                  marks, we used linen patches with frayed edges, adhered with
                  glue paste.
                </p>
                <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  Conservators usually treat isolated paintings or less numerous
                  sets than the Apostolate series. In this case, having in our
                  hands a series of fourteen paintings, we were able to find
                  similarities and correspondences between technical and
                  material solutions. Although several of these characteristics
                  are common in the pictorial production of New Spain, it is
                  very important to emphasize that these features determine the
                  kind of intervention to be performed, which must always
                  respect the original materials and should strive for minimal
                  intervention.

                  Most studies on Viceregal painting focus on the works by
                  important known painters. However, as our case study
                  demonstrates, anonymous paintings have much to offer as well.
                  This series, which could have gone otherwise unnoticed, has
                  allowed us to collect important information that provides
                  valuable historical data concerning the artist, how we worked,
                  and the ways in which he obtained his materials almost three
                  hundred years ago. Finally, we would like to insist on the
                  importance of sharing knowledge and experiences in
                  publications such as this one, which allow us to spread
                  results, both positive and negative, because it all enriches
                  us not only as individuals but as a community.

                  In recent years, nanocellulose-based products and multilayered
                  nanoparticles have emerged as new solutions for the
                  consolidation of canvas-supported paintings. This paper
                  focuses on these recently developed treatments as applied in
                  the framework of the European Commission’s Horizon 2020
                  project Nanorestart. It provides a summary of their
                  properties, advantages, and disadvantages in terms of ease of
                  application, reinforcement provided, visual appearance, and
                  stability. Physicochemical and mechanical results of the tests
                  performed in the past couple of years are presented. The
                  treatments can be divided into three categories—pure
                  nanocellulose, nanocomposite, and multilayered
                  nanoparticles—characterized by different compositions, degrees
                  of penetration, and modes of consolidation. This project has
                  used a systematic multiscale approach to review the potential
                  of new consolidants for the structural consolidation of
                  canvas-supported paintings. An overall account of the benefits
                  of each consolidation approach are presented on the basis of
                  previously published work. It is anticipated that these
                  treatments will offer an alternative to lining and
                  consolidants currently in use and prevent the recurrence of
                  the issues highlighted in the Greenwich conference.

                <p>
                  Recently, new developments in painting conservation have seen
                  the introduction of nanocellulose (NC; nano-size clusters of
                  cellulose chains) and multilayered nanoparticles as more
                  compatible treatments for the consolidation and
                  deacidification of canvases of modern and contemporary
                  paintings ([[Nechyporchuk et al. 2018]]; [[Xu et al. 2020]];
                  [[Baglioni et al. 2013]]). These nanoparticles have raised
                  significant interest for their astonishing mechanical,
                  optical, and barrier properties, as well as their high
                  tunability through functionalization ([[Ly et al. 2008]];
                  [[Dufresne 2017]]). More specifically, the shared cellulosic
                  nature of the nanocellulose-based treatments and the treated
                  material, together with the small particle size, ensures a
                  high compatibility between nanocellulose and canvas substrates
                  to be treated. In that respect, they can offer an alternative
                  to current adhesives used in conservation (e.g., animal glue,
                  wax-resin) and the risks associated with their poor

                  Bailie 1981]]). However, the mode of interaction between these
                  new biopolymers and existing canvas cellulose fibers needs to
                  be understood in far greater detail in order to advise both
                  materials scientists and conservators about the merits and
                  limitations of these new materials.

                  In the framework of the Nanorestart project,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  a range of nano-products were developed as consolidants
                  ([[Bridarolli 2019]]; [[Nechyporchuk et al. 2018]];
                  [[Palladino et al. 2020]]; [[Xu et al. 2020]]). They included,
                  first, nanocellulose-based products with the aqueous
                  dispersions of cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), carboxymethylated
                  CNF (CCNF), and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), as well as
                  composite materials made of mixtures of CNF or CNC and
                  cellulose derivative (e.g., methylcellulose) in polar or
                  apolar solvents. They also encompassed multilayered
                  nanoparticles with a central inorganic core and two organic
                  layers, the outer one being of cellulosic nature.

                  The mechanical and physicochemical properties of the
                  nanocellulose-based consolidants for canvas were assessed and
                  compared to traditional consolidants used in conservation such
                  as natural (animal glue) and synthetic polymers (Paraloid
                  B‑72, Plexisol P&nbsp;550, Beva&nbsp;371, Aquazol&nbsp;200) ([[Bridarolli et
                  al. 2020]]; [[Nechyporchuk et al. 2018]]). Preliminary tests
                  were performed on a model aged cotton canvas. The
                  morphological, chemical, and mechanical properties of the
                  canvas samples before and after treatment were evaluated by
                  field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM),
                  tensile tests, and dynamic mechanical analysis under
                  controlled relative humidity cycling (DMA-RH) ([[Bridarolli et
                  al. 2020]]; [[Bridarolli 2019]]; [[Bridarolli et al. 2018b]]).
                  Additionally, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to
                  nondestructively quantify the adhesion between the different
                  compounds of this multilayered structure ([[Bridarolli et al.
                  2018b]]).

                <p>
                  Finally, the assessment of the newly developed consolidants,
                  including the nanocellulose and multilayered particles, was
                  performed on sacrificial historical paintings to validate the
                  results obtained on the cotton canvas mock-ups. The
                  consolidation achieved was also quantified by DMA-RH.
                  Variations in the visual and aesthetic appearance of the
                  treated paintings and the handling properties of the different
                  nanoproducts were evaluated, as they were also deemed
                  essential by conservators.

                  Two plain-weave canvases were selected (modern cotton and
                  historical linen). Cotton canvas, 341&nbsp;g/m^2^ density and 9 and
                  11 threads/cm in the warp and weft directions, respectively,
                  was purchased from Barna Art (Barcelona, Spain) and
                  artificially aged before testing, reaching a degree of
                  polymerization of 450. This was to mimic the state of
                  degradation of a painting canvas for which consolidation
                  treatment would be required ([[Oriola et al. 2011]]). The
                  aging protocol involved immersing the canvas in concentrated
                  hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide for three days, as
                  reported elsewhere ([[Nechyporchuk et al. 2017]]).

                  Linen canvas (ca. nineteenth century), previously used as a
                  lining canvas, with dense weaving (20 and 23 threads/cm in
                  warp and weft, respectively) and density of ~310&nbsp;g/m^2^ was
                  also tested. The canvas was dusty and impregnated with glue
                  (probably proteinaceous), and was therefore washed in hot
                  water (50°C–60°C) prior to the experiment. Excess glue was
                  scraped off the surface with a scalpel, and the canvas was
                  left to dry under no tensioning. The threads of this canvas
                  were thinner than the threads of the new cotton canvas and of
                  irregular diameter.

                  Three treatments were used: pure nanocellulose, nanocomposite,
                  and multilayered nanoparticle (NP) consolidants, as presented
                  in [<strong>fig. 27.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/27-Bridarolli/fig-27-1).
                  Details of the treatments can be found in the Technical
                  Information appendix.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  The consolidating materials consist of cellulose nanoparticles
                  dispersed in water or a 50:50 water-ethanol solution. These
                  can be highly crystalline, as for CNC, or less crystalline, as
                  for CNF and CCNF. Originally extracted from wood, the
                  particles’ size and surface properties depend on the
                  extraction methods used and chemical functionalization. CNF
                  and CCNF (chemically modified CNF) are long cellulose fibrils.
                  In contrast, CNC, obtained after the dissolution of the
                  amorphous phase of cellulose through acid hydrolysis, are
                  typically smaller NPs in the shape of a rice grain. CNCs are
                  7.5 ± 2.8&nbsp;nm in diameter and ~0.5&nbsp;µm in length; the CNFs are
                  7.0 ± 2.8&nbsp;nm in diameter and longer than CNCs, with lengths of
                  several micrometers. CCNF corresponds to CNF particles
                  chemically modified to obtain CNF with carboxymethyl groups
                  along the cellulosic chain. The particles are usually similar
                  in size to CNF with fibrils of several micrometers in length
                  but are also much thinner (2.4 ± 0.9&nbsp;nm diameter)
                  ([[Nechyporchuk et al. 2018]]). Combined with a higher surface
                  charge density, CCNFs yield thicker suspensions.

                  The second solution consists of a methyl hydroxyethyl
                  cellulose–CNC nanocomposite (MC+CNC) in water (w) or in
                  heptane (h) following silylation ([[Böhme et al. 2020]]).
                  Methyl hydroxyethyl cellulose is an adhesive commonly used in
                  paper conservation and has proven to be stable over time
                  ([[Feller and Wilt 1990]]). It is a very hygroscopic material
                  with excellent adhesion properties but reduced stiffness. As a
                  result, its use as a consolidant is inadequate, and it
                  requires the addition of a nanocellulosic filler. A small
                  amount of nanofiller (from 5% to 15% in weight) added to
                  materials in diverse areas from construction (concrete) to
                  food science has been shown to improve their mechanical
                  properties and reduce hygroscopic behavior ([[Azeredo et al.

                  The last solution proposed for canvas consolidation consists
                  of polyelectrolyte-treated silica nanoparticles (SNPs) and
                  CaCO~3~ NPs (CaNPs). Silica nanoparticles have already proven
                  to be good candidates for textile and paper reinforcement
                  ([[Gärdlund, Wågberg, and Gernandt 2003]]; [[Tan, Tay, and Teo
                  2005]]) due to their small particle size and the possibility
                  to chemically modify their surface to tune their affinity for
                  cellulose fibers, while alkaline nanoparticles have been
                  widely used for the deacidification of textiles and paper
                  ([[Giorgi et al. 2002]]; [[Baglioni et al. 2013]]). The
                  mixture of CaNPs and SNPs was designed to address mechanical
                  reinforcement and deacidification with a single-step
                  treatment. Both types of nanoparticles are functionalized
                  first with a cationic polyelectrolyte (PEI) and then, as the
                  outer layer, by the anionic sodium carboxymethyl cellulose
                  (CMC). The detailed preparation procedure is reported

                  DMA-RH cycling was performed under programmed RH and fixed
                  temperature (25°C) conditions to assess the mechanical
                  response of the canvases to fluctuations in RH. Canvases made
                  of natural or synthetic fibers are viscoelastic materials,
                  meaning that their mechanical response to external stress
                  depends on the rate of stress applied in tensile tests or
                  frequency. It also means that they can exhibit both elastic
                  and viscous behaviors. DMA was introduced into the evaluation
                  of paintings conservation to measure both the elastic
                  (storage) modulus, <em>E’</em>, and viscous (loss) modulus,
                  <em>E’'</em>, components in the mechanical response of samples
                  from paintings. Its first use was to measure the glass
                  transition temperature of paint films ([[Hedley et al.
                  1991]]), and was subsequently used in studies of painting
                  canvases ([[Odlyha, Chan, and Pages 1995]]; [[Foster, Odlyha,

                  For this study, a new protocol was developed (involving
                  programmed RH cycling between low and high RH levels) based on
                  studies of the viscoelastic response to RH variations of
                  electrospun nanocellulose composite nanofibers by Peresin et
                  al. ([[Peresin et al. 2010]]). This protocol was recently
                  applied to evaluate the effects of environmental conditions
                  and conservation treatments on painting canvases ([[Bridarolli
                  et al. 2018a]]; [[Bridarolli et al. 2020]]). The RH range for
                  the tests (from 20% to 80% RH), was selected so that the
                  current study could be correlated with previous studies on the
                  response of painting materials to moisture, which often take
                  values between 10% and 90% RH ([[Andersen 2013]]; [[Hedley

                  A protocol was developed specifically for the historical linen
                  canvas to enable testing the sample nondestructively before
                  and after application of the treatments. DMA testing was used
                  instead of tensile testing (for the latter, plastic—hence
                  irreversible—deformation is usually applied). This was
                  essential due to the irregular structure of the canvas and
                  inhomogeneous distribution of remains of glue. Samples (15 x 7
                  mm)—cut in the same direction and impossible to identify as
                  warp or weft—were clamped before the treatment application on
                  a weighing boat cut into a frame to avoid shrinkage or
                  deformation. The same amount of treatment, resulting in a 3%
                  added weight, was applied to each clamped canvas sample and
                  spread using a spatula. The storage modulus (<em>E’</em>) of
                  the linen canvas samples was measured three times before and
                  after the application of the treatments (left to dry for two
                  days) at constant RH and temperature (30% RH, 25°C), chosen as
                  typical room conditions. Each sample was preconditioned
                  overnight at 20% RH prior to the tests.

                  two other treatments ([[Nechyporchuk et al. 2018]]). They also
                  observed the formation of interfibrillar bridges between
                  fibers of the treated surface ([[Bridarolli et al. 2018b]]).
                  The roughness of the canvas also seems visually reduced. For
                  this specific treatment, the results in terms of
                  deposition/penetration showed were independent of the mode of
                  application (spray or brush), but this was not the case for
                  results with solutions 2 and 3. Greater penetration of the
                  treatment was achieved for the aqueous nanocomposite treatment
                  MC+CNC (w) when brushed on (see
                  <a href="#fig-27-2"><strong>fig. 27.2</strong></a>). In a separate study, a fluorescent dye (rhodamine B) was
                  used mixed with the treatments ([[Bridarolli 2019]]). This
                  approach enabled us to follow the penetration of the treatment
                  in the canvas and observe that an almost complete impregnation
                  of the canvas could be achieved. Spraying the treatment,
                  instead of brushing it on, limited the penetration to the very
                  first micrometers of the treated surface, resulting in surface
                  coating similar to that obtained with the pure nanocellulose
                  consolidants. The hydrophobic MC+CNC&nbsp;(h) also showed limited
                  penetration, probably caused by the high viscosity of the
                  treatment and its fast drying time.

                  Multilayered NPs sprayed onto degraded cotton canvases tend to
                  be homogeneously distributed across the surface of the
                  canvas’s fibers and to form homogeneous monolayers ({Kolman et
                  al. 2018}). Interfibrillar bridges made of dense agglomerate
                  of NPs were also observed by SEM (red arrows in fig. 27.2,
                  solution 3) and could participate in the consolidation by
                  locking the fibrous structure. Kolman et al. also observed the
                  high penetration achieved for the NPs using micro- X-ray
                  fluorescence but stressed the role of the viscosity as a
                  limiting factor ({Kolman et al. 2018}). For concentrations
                  above 4.5% w/w in water, the NPs remained on the canvas
                  surface.

                <h2 id="consolidation" tabindex="-1">Consolidation</h2>
                <p>
                  The increase in stiffness was used to rank the effectiveness
                  of the consolidation provided and was calculated in the range
                  of 1%–2% elongation, which is what is typically used to
                  restretch canvases ([[Mecklenburg 1982]]). This decision was
                  driven by the understanding that in any painting in need of
                  consolidation due to a very weak canvas both the paint and
                  ground layers are no longer supported by it, and it is the
                  ground layer that acts as a supporting medium. Effective
                  consolidation of the canvas should, therefore, ensure that the
                  stiffness of the canvas matches that of the ground and paint
                  layers it supports. A similar response to moisture as that of
                  the original canvas or ground and paint layer should also be
                  favored, as any deviation in this response may result in the
                  creation of significant internal stresses, which ultimately
                  lead to mechanical failure. The Young’s moduli reported in
                  <a href="#table-27-1"><strong>table 27.1</strong></a>, and measured from the tensile curves, show that higher
                  stiffness (hence consolidation) was attained with the pure
                  nanocellulose treatments than with the nanocomposites. The
                  reinforcement provided was not influenced by the method of
                  application (brushing or spraying).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kolman et al. also reported higher consolidation achieved on
                  degraded cotton canvas for the multilayered NPs than for the
                  CNF treatment ([[Kolman et al. 2018]]). However, these results
                  cannot be directly compared to those shown for solutions 1 and
                  2, as the experimental conditions and direction of testing
                  used differed between the tests (see
                  <a href="#table-27-1"><strong>table 27.1</strong></a>). The stiffness achieved by all the treatments proved to be
                  adequate, as considered by the conservators. Nechyporchuk et
                  al. reported similar values of stiffness for CNF, CCNF, and
                  CNC-treated degraded cotton canvases compared to sized and
                  primed degraded cotton canvases measured in the weft direction
                  ([[Nechyporchuk et al. 2018]]).

                  Penetration, Cohesion, and Adhesion
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The performance of the consolidants relies mainly on their
                  penetration, adhesion, and cohesion, which could, therefore,
                  be tuned to improve the reinforcement provided. The
                  penetration of the treatments can affect the reversibility of
                  the treatments, but it also plays a role in the consolidation
                  achieved, its efficiency, and its stability. As reported in
                  <a href="#table-27-1"><strong>table 27.1</strong></a>, a lower consolidation is achieved by the nanocomposites
                  treatments compared to the pure nanocellulosic treatments for
                  the same weight added. This could be explained by the fact
                  that because of the higher penetration of the treatment
                  MC+CNC&nbsp;(w) treatment, a greater amount of treatment is
                  required to fill up the canvas volume and reach a
                  reinforcement equivalent to the one provided by CNF, CCNF, and
                  CNC. Regarding the pure nanocellulose treatments, which behave
                  as surface coatings, the consolidation is provided by this
                  additional stiff layer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The role of adhesion was demonstrated in a study on
                  CNF-reinforced cotton canvases ([[Bridarolli et al. 2018a]]).
                  Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to quantify the adhesion
                  forces between canvas and treatments, it was demonstrated that
                  the addition of a cationic polymer between the canvas and the
                  CNF improved their adhesion and resulted in increased
                  efficiency of the nanocellulosic consolidation. However, since
                  the polymer was also associated with a strong yellowing of the
                  canvas, this consolidation strategy was discarded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The last important factor affecting the consolidation is the
                  cohesive properties of the material. Examples are the pure
                  nanocellulose treatments, whose efficiency could be undermined
                  by their loss of cohesion due to brittleness. As highlighted
                  in past studies ([[Bridarolli et al. 2018b]]; [[Nechyporchuk
                  et al. 2018]]; [[Bridarolli et al. 2020]]), sudden
                  discontinuities in the stress-strain curves result from
                  rupture of coatings formed by the pure nanocellulose, whether
                  sprayed or brushed on the canvases. The mechanical failure of
                  the treatments could occur at elongations above 1.5%, which is
                  within the 1%–2% range typically used to restretch canvases
                  ([[Mecklenburg 1982]]). These observations stress the risks of
                  gradually losing the reinforcement provided over time due to
                  repetitive handling, transport, and mechanical stresses caused
                  by significant environmental variations. However, If they are
                  applied in large enough quantities, it is expected that the
                  rupture of the coating might occur at greater
                  elongation—beyond the typical 1%-2% range used in
                  conservation.

                <p>
                  By observing the high penetration and bulk consolidation
                  reached by multilayered NPs in degraded canvas, Kolman et al.
                  suggested the use of this treatment in combination with pure
                  nanocellulosic treatments ([[Kolman et al. 2018]]). The
                  canvases tested with this mixture showed increased
                  consolidation, as they benefited from a multidepth
                  consolidation both in bulk and at the surface.

                  DMA-RH: Hygroscopic Response from a Mechanistic Perspective
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Mechanical stresses experienced by a painting are also often
                  caused by environmental factors, such as variations in
                  relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T). Some constitutive
                  layers of a painting are hydrophilic and highly responsive to
                  RH, while others are less so. Cotton and linen canvases are
                  moisture-sensitive supports. At 65%&nbsp;RH, linen and cotton can
                  take up moisture to 12% and 8.5% in mass, respectively
                  ([[Hill, Norton, and Newman 2009]]). The individual layers
                  also present differential mechanical responses to fluctuations
                  in RH and T. Mecklenburg and Hedley have shown that canvas and
                  glue layers, being responsive to moisture, will swell or
                  contract and respond faster than other layers to RH changes
                  ([[Mecklenburg 1982]]; [[Hedley 1988]]). The glue layer will
                  become more brittle or more plastic at low and high RH levels,
                  respectively. The canvas in contrast will develop greater
                  forces above 80%&nbsp;RH. A more hydrophobic material, such as the
                  paint layer, will be more sensitive to change in temperature.
                  These differential behaviors toward RH and T variations
                  observed between constitutive layers of a painting can lead to
                  the building up of strong shear and tensile stresses, which
                  are stresses that are coplanar and perpendicular,
                  respectively, to the face of the material on which the load is
                  acting. As a result, delamination or the rupture of the
                  different layers resulting from the release of the accumulated
                  tension can occur and spread onto and across the entire
                  painting ([[Bergeaud, Hulot, and Roche 1997]]; [[Karpowicz
                  1989]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The response of samples to moisture was tested using DMA with
                  RH-cycling.
                  <strong><a href="#fig-27-3">Fig. 27.3</a></strong> demonstrates
                  the similar mechanical behavior of the treated samples—CNF,
                  CCNF, and MC+CNC&nbsp;(h)—characterized by successive decreases in
                  storage modulus (<em>E’</em>) (stiffness) with RH increase
                  (80%&nbsp;RH), and then increases in stiffness with RH decrease
                  (20%&nbsp;RH). The magnitude of the response, however, varies
                  between samples (<a href="#table-27-2"><strong>table 27.2</strong></a>). Differences in <em>E’</em> between 20%&nbsp;and 80%&nbsp;RH plateau
                  over the three RH cycles (Δ<em>E’~20%–80%&nbsp;RH~</em>) show the
                  highest value for the CNF-treated sample (Δ<em>E’~20%–80%&nbsp;RH~</em>
                  =12.9±1.8&nbsp;MPa) and lower values for untreated and MC+CNC&nbsp;(h)
                  samples (Δ<em>E’~20%–80%&nbsp;RH~</em> =7.6±0.2&nbsp;MPa and
                  8.3±0.9&nbsp;MPa, respectively). Overall, these results and
                  previous studies have shown that the change in stiffness of
                  the treated samples remains higher than for the untreated
                  canvas, except for CNC-treated samples tested using 20%–60%&nbsp;RH
                  cycles ([[Bridarolli et al. 2018b]]; [[Bridarolli 2019]]). It
                  is yet to be understood whether the magnitude of these changes
                  in stiffness would pose a risk to paintings.

                  Testing on Historical Canvases
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Visual assessment as well as handling properties of the
                  treatments were evaluated on different occasions in the
                  framework of the Nanorestart project by a small group of
                  painting conservators, and results were recently published
                  ([[Oriola-Folch et al. 2020]]; [[Böhme et al. 2020]]). Tests
                  were carried out on modern linen, cotton, and jute canvases;
                  on historical lining canvases (linen); and on nineteenth- and
                  twentieth-century acrylic- and oil-based paintings on linen
                  and cotton canvases. Overall, the authors reported that all
                  the new products performed well on white cotton canvases. On
                  darker canvases, most of the treatments showed minimal color
                  change, especially compared to the traditional animal glue
                  consolidant, which darkens canvases ([[Oriola-Folch et al.
                  2020]]). The only exceptions were the heptane-based
                  nanocomposites, which strongly whiten the canvas, especially
                  the formulation mixed with nanoparticles of MgO. (This was
                  part of a strategy combining consolidation with canvas
                  deacidification.) Change in gloss was also observed only for
                  the heptane-based nanocomposites.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following these evaluations, further mechanical tests were
                  carried out using one of the lining canvases found in Böhme’s
                  study ([[Böhme et al. 2020]]). The protocol developed for
                  these tests enabled assessment of the treatments on more
                  representative canvases (historical material, naturally aged,
                  soiled, and with traces of one or more glues) while minimizing
                  the variability due to the inhomogeneous nature of these
                  materials. For these final tests, the water-based and
                  heptane-based nanocomposites tested were mixed with
                  deacidification agents: CaCO~3~ and MgO, respectively. The
                  presence of CaCO~3~ had been shown not to affect the
                  reinforcement provided by MC+CNC in water ([[Bridarolli
                  2019]]). Canvases treated with the solvents used in the
                  treatments were also tested in order to isolate the impact of
                  the treatment from the solvent itself.

                  <a href="#fig-27-4"><strong>Fig. 27.4</strong></a> shows the
                  calculated percentage increase in storage modulus
                  <em>E’</em> (30%&nbsp;RH, 25°C, 30&nbsp;min. equilibration) measured for
                  the linen canvas samples and resulting from the application of
                  the treatments. All led to the consolidation of the historical
                  canvases, seen in the increase in stiffness (<em>E’</em>). The
                  greatest increase in <em>E’</em> was reached with the
                  MC+CNC+CaCO~3&nbsp;~(w) treatment (increase of 126% ±30%), followed
                  by CNF (83% ±24%) and CCNF (53% ±17%). The high level of
                  stiffening reached using MC+CNC+CaCO~3&nbsp;~(w) was not observed
                  for its counterpart, the heptane-based treatment MC&nbsp;+ CNC&nbsp;+
                  MgO&nbsp;(h) (25 ±10%), nor was it for the multilayered NPs (20%
                  ±17%). The limited consolidation conferred by the latter on
                  the historical linen canvas calls for further research, as
                  this contradicts previous tensile testing results performed on
                  degraded modern cotton canvases (see
                  <a href="#table-27-1"><strong>table 27.1</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The results on historical lining canvas confirm those obtained
                  on degraded modern cotton canvases. They also show that the
                  inherent presence of traces of glue or oil-based substances on
                  historical canvases may inevitability lead to modifications of
                  their mechanical properties through the application of solvent
                  alone. The application of water alone led to a significant
                  increase in canvas’s stiffness (~22%) in comparison to
                  heptane, which tends to soften the canvas (see
                  <a href="#fig-27-4"><strong>fig. 27.4</strong></a>). This could explain the higher consolidation reached for
                  the MC+CNC+CaCO~3&nbsp;~(w) treatment compared to CNF, CCNF, and
                  CNC treatments, which was not observed when testing the
                  degraded modern cotton canvas (see
                  <a href="#table-27-1"><strong>table 27.1</strong></a>). Due to the higher viscosity of MC+CNC+CaCO~3&nbsp;~(w) at
                  2%&nbsp;w/w in comparison to CNF and CCNF, it is possible that the
                  canvas might have been exposed for a longer time to the water
                  present in the MC+CNC+CaCO~3&nbsp;~(w) gel. This would have given
                  more time for the remains of glue present in the lining canvas
                  to swell and reform in a renewed sizing layer.

                  These studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the
                  nanocellulose-based and multilayered nanoparticle treatments
                  for the consolidation of degraded cotton and historical linen

                  studied in both polar and apolar solvents and with different
                  handling properties, physical behavior (viscosity,
                  penetration, response to RH) (<a href="#fig-27-5"><strong>fig. 27.5</strong></a>), which makes them suitable for various substrates. The
                  reinforcement provided is also greater, with less weight
                  added, in comparison with traditional the consolidants animal

                  This research marks the first step in the introduction and
                  evaluation of three different types of treatments using
                  nanocellulose and multilayered nanoparticles as potential
                  consolidants for canvas-supported paintings. Further
                  developments and improvements of their capabilities have been
                  shown to be possible by mixing treatments together (e.g.,
                  multiscale reinforcement mixing solutions 1 and 3), combining
                  deacidification and consolidation strategies (e.g.,
                  nanocomposites, multilayered NPs), or simply by changing the
                  application method, treatment viscosity, or
                  treatment-to-canvas adhesion. In this latter case, the
                  adhesion could be improved through modification of the surface
                  chemistry of the NPs used for consolidation.

                <p>
                  This work has successfully evaluated the effects of the three
                  treatments. The acceptance and validation of the products
                  could not have been possible without the input of
                  conservators. This fact highlights the importance of
                  organizing future workshops using this range of nanoproducts
                  with practicing conservators. It has also highlighted the
                  importance of supporting the findings with quantitative
                  assessments of the physical and mechanical properties of the
                  consolidants. The ability to perform quantitative analysis on
                  historical samples has been shown to optimize the evaluation
                  protocol and to complement subjective testing procedures, and
                  this may in turn help to speed acceptance of these new
                  treatments. Further testing is, however, still needed to
                  establish if the mechanical response to fluctuations in RH is
                  within acceptable limits and, in the long term, sustainable
                  for the safe preservation of paintings. Development of new
                  strategies to reduce the amount of solvent applied with the
                  treatments is also essential.

                  The CNF was produced from softwood pulp (~75% pine and 25%
                  spruce, containing 85% cellulose, 15% hemicellulose, and
                  traces of lignin, as determined by the supplier).
                  Carboxymethylated CNF (CCNF), also in the form of an aqueous
                  suspension, was kindly provided by Research Institutes of
                  Sweden (RISE) Bioeconomy (Sweden). The CCNF was produced from
                  a softwood sulfite dissolving pulp (Domsjö Dissolving Plus,
                  Domsjö Fabriker AB, Sweden) by carboxymethylation, as
                  described by others ([[Wågberg and Bjőrklund 1993]]), followed
                  by mechanical fibrillation. Nanocrystalline cellulose (CNC) in
                  powder form was purchased from CelluForce (Canada). It was
                  produced from bleached kraft pulp by sulfuric acid hydrolysis.

                  Adhesive meshes are thin, flexible microstructure nets made
                  from pure methyl cellulose or sturgeon glue—and in the future
                  possibly poly(isobutyl methacrylate). Whereas ready-made glue
                  mixtures like acrylic dispersions or heat-seal adhesives may
                  contain changeable and uncertain ingredients, adhesive meshes
                  consist of homogenous, constant materials with convincing
                  aging resistance. The bonding procedure is carried out by
                  positioning the mesh in its dry state, activating it with a
                  controlled supply of moisture or solvents, and applying
                  pressure to generate the adhesion. Thus, instead of
                  penetrating the canvas, the adhesive remains discretely in the
                  joint, assuring a regular, permeable adhesive pattern. The
                  method’s advantages further include adjustability of the
                  adhesive strength and increased reversibility. Case studies
                  implementing water-soluble adhesive meshes illustrate the
                  range of application techniques and bonding properties,
                  depending on the choice of adhesive.

                <p>
                  In order to preserve paintings’ authenticity, lining today has
                  become the exception rather than the rule. Nevertheless, the
                  application of a complete or partial textile support is
                  indispensable in the case of severe degradation or damage
                  phenomena. But this presents challenges concerning the choice
                  and application of adhesives. The development of a new canvas
                  bonding technique using microstructure adhesive meshes
                  described in this paper aims at solving complex conservation
                  issues while fulfilling criteria such as purity and long-term
                  stability of adhesives, controllable application, and
                  reversibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The choice of materials includes unblended adhesives that have
                  been tested extensively and are established in conservation
                  practice: methylcellulose, sturgeon glue, and poly(isobutyl
                  methacrylate) (PiBMA). Application is carried out by
                  positioning the dry adhesive mesh on the object or lining
                  fabric, then activating the adhesive with water or organic
                  solvents, and finally joining the parts under pressure until
                  dry. This technique provides a diffusive and reversible
                  bonding, using low amounts of adhesive, water, or solvent,
                  thus assuring a minimally invasive and highly controllable
                  treatment. Strip-lining, attachment of small patches on the
                  back of small holes (e.g., nail holes along the tacking
                  margin), and readhering historic linings have all been
                  successfully accomplished.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Production and application of adhesive meshes was the
                  objective of a research project between the Bern University of
                  Applied Sciences and APM Technica AG, both Switzerland, and
                  the Dresden University of Fine Arts, Germany. The project
                  began in 2018 and was financed by the Swiss Federal Innovation
                  Agency. This paper introduces the development,
                  characteristics, and choice of materials used for adhesive
                  meshes, as well as activation strategies recently tested,
                  based on case studies.

                  Current Lining Techniques and Materials—Opportunities and
                  Limits
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Looking back at the evolution of lining techniques over the
                  last decades, one finds multiple approaches that attempt to
                  reduce the amount of adhesive applied and adhesive
                  penetration, as well as the impact of elevated temperatures,
                  water, or solvents, all of which enable increased
                  reversibility. The most important achievements include Mehra’s
                  nap-bond cold-lining ([[Mehra 1975]]), Heiber’s
                  <em>Geweberasterhaftung</em> (grid adhesion) technique
                  ([[Heiber 1987]]), and the more recent mist-lining ([[van Och
                  and Hoppenbrouwers 2003]]). Their common characteristic is the
                  application of the adhesive compound as an openly structured
                  layer on the lining canvas, rather than on the original
                  canvas. When dried and solid, it is reactivated by means of
                  heat or solvents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Adhesives based on synthetic polymers are popular for those
                  and most other lining applications today, including heat-seal
                  adhesives like Beva 371 and different polymer dispersions.
                  However, all are composed of highly complex formulations,
                  prone to segregation, altering mechanical properties, and they
                  often exhibit poor long-term stability.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Surfactants in acrylic dispersions, for instance, can degrade
                  or migrate from the bulk adhesive, whereas the plasticizer in
                  Beva 371 is basically able to migrate into the painting
                  structure ([[Cimino et al. 2020]]; [[Lazzari et al. 2011]]).
                  Of utmost concern, though, are modifications of the
                  composition without indication by the manufacturer, as well as
                  renaming and discontinuation of products, resulting in altered
                  working and aging properties ([[Cimino et al. 2020]];
                  [[Ploeger, McGlinchey, and de la Rie 2015]]). In addition,
                  application of synthetic polymer adhesives requires high
                  temperatures (in excess of 60°C) or harmful solvents, which
                  might also pose a risk to paint layers. Although modern
                  techniques emphasize reversibility, inevitable residues may
                  limit the options for further treatments.

                  Toward a New Approach to Canvas Bonding
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Based on the concerns outlined above, pure, extensively tested
                  adhesives with good aging properties are preferable as
                  materials for canvas bonding. Methylcellulose, sturgeon glue,
                  and PiBMA, which have, so far, not commonly been used for this
                  particular purpose, show good long-term aging behavior and
                  have found broad application in the field of conservation for
                  several decades (see Characteristics and Materials of Adhesive
                  Meshes below). However, these adhesives are mostly applied in
                  liquid form, commonly as weak solutions. Owing to the high
                  proportion of water or solvent, such solutions tend to
                  penetrate porous materials like canvas. This may result in a
                  weak bond ([[Soppa et al. 2014]]), heterogenous adhesive
                  distribution, stiffening and darkening of the canvas, or
                  water-induced shrinkage of the canvas, with subsequent paint
                  delamination.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To overcome the risks related to the application of liquid
                  solutions, solid and dry adhesive films that can be activated
                  have been developed, of which Beva 371 films are the most
                  common. With the aim to minimize adhesive input and reduce
                  heat-induced risks, we developed adhesive meshes rather than
                  films, made from the materials mentioned above. These can be
                  activated with controlled supply of water or solvent. The
                  method originates from a diploma project’s approach to fix an
                  old lining with sturgeon glue meshes. In this thesis, the
                  manual production and a first application of mesh prototypes
                  were implemented, followed by preliminary tests of the bond
                  strength using different activation parameters ([[Konietzny
                  2014]]; [[Konietzny 2015]]). The highly promising results
                  initiated the idea to pursue this approach with a dedicated
                  research project.

                  Characteristics and Materials of Adhesive Meshes
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Adhesive meshes are flexible structures made from a single
                  adhesive. Their initial square mesh geometry was recently
                  replaced by a honeycomb design that provides an optimized
                  bonding pattern ([<strong>fig. 28.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/28-Konietzny/fig-28-1)),
                  while reducing adhesive input even further. The material
                  thickness of the adhesive mesh is about 200 μm, and the
                  interspaces have an average diameter of 500 to 600 μm. One
                  square meter of an adhesive mesh weighs between 15 and 30 g,
                  depending on the production process and adhesive.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  The defined honeycomb shape enables an exceptionally uniform
                  distribution of the adhesive throughout the bonding surface.
                  Despite the lack of a carrier material, the meshes have a
                  certain stiffness that allows access to detached layers
                  through gaps or slits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contact with water or solvent, the solid meshes become
                  tacky, thereby requiring lower amounts of a liquid phase than
                  solutions do to achieve sufficient adhesion. Proper activation
                  causes only swelling, not dissolution of the mesh, assuring
                  the adhesives remains discretely in the joint without
                  penetrating into the textile. The bond strength can reach
                  similar values to Beva 371 (65 µm) films, depending on the
                  activation parameters.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  The bonding characteristics can be adjusted by varying the
                  amount of water or solvent: the more solvent that is
                  applied—up to the point of liquefaction—the stronger the
                  activation and the higher the bond strength tends to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thanks to the mesh structure, a more homogenous bonding can be
                  achieved, while maintaining higher flexibility, permeability,
                  and presumably less tension compared to the adhesive’s
                  application as solution or gel. Furthermore, the reversibility
                  of the bond will be improved due to lower tendency of the
                  adhesive to migrate and penetrate. Depending on the
                  requirements of the individual painting and treatment, the
                  adhesive can be tailored using three materials that differ
                  mainly in activation time and bonding properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Methylcellulose is among the most durable adhesives used in
                  conservation ([[Feller and Wilt 1993]]). The water-soluble,
                  semisynthetic carbohydrate exhibits constant material
                  properties due to its standardized industrial production.
                  Hydrophilic and hydrophobic substituents along the polymer
                  chain can develop affinities to a broad range of substrates of
                  polar and nonpolar nature. The material has been investigated
                  extensively for conservation treatments, with the conclusion
                  that its common perception as a weak adhesive is obsolete
                  ([[Sindlinger-Maushardt and Petersen 2007]]). Convincing
                  results have been reported for adhering paint flakes on canvas
                  ([[Soppa et al. 2014]]; [[Soppa et al. 2017]]) and for canvas
                  bonding ([[Sindlinger-Maushardt and Petersen 2007]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  For adhesive meshes, two types of Methocel were chosen.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  They differ mainly in degree of polymerization—and thus
                  viscosity. Methocel A15LV is of low viscosity and hence
                  requires a short activation time with low amounts of water. It
                  proved suitable for inaccessible bonding surfaces and
                  water-sensitive materials where only a minimum of humidity is
                  acceptable. Methocel A4C is of medium viscosity but requires
                  more time and water to be activated. The bond strength exceeds
                  that of Methocel A15LV and seems to be equivalent to Beva 371
                  film (65 µm) bonding ([[Sindlinger-Maushardt and Petersen
                  2007]]). Consequently, its use is recommended in cases where
                  bonding surfaces are accessible, water input can be
                  controlled, and a high bond strength is desired. Due to the
                  delayed response to humidity, methylcellulose might be
                  advantageous for larger areas that need to be bonded, as well
                  as objects that do not require climate control.
                  Methylcellulose meshes are particularly suitable for paintings
                  that are sensitive to heat, as no elevated temperatures are
                  required for activation.

                  Sturgeon glue is a traditional adhesive and still in frequent
                  use in conservation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  Sturgeon glue is gaining popularity in modern paintings
                  conservation thanks to its good adhesive properties and has
                  been investigated for paint consolidation
                  ([[Sindlinger-Maushardt and Petersen 2007]]; [[Soppa et al.
                  2014]]), tear mending ([[Flock 2014]]), and canvas bonding
                  using glue solutions ([[Geißinger and Krekel 2007]];
                  [[Mecklenburg, Fuster-López, and Ottolini 2012]]). As a
                  material of natural origin, with variations in the raw
                  material and processing ([[Soppa 2018|, 42]]), it can display
                  a range of bonding properties. The glue does slightly discolor
                  over time, unlike methylcellulose ([[Pataki-Hundt 2018]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sturgeon glue remains sufficiently water soluble over time,
                  and its adhesive strength barely changes ([[Geißinger and
                  Krekel 2007]]; [[Przybylo 2006]]). It is prone to rapid
                  response to fluctuating relative humidity and, in the long
                  run, to increased crystallinity in films ([[Schellmann
                  2007]]). This fact limits the application of sturgeon glue
                  meshes preferably to smaller areas or objects in controlled
                  environmental conditions. On the other hand, considerable tack
                  develops within a very short activation time with only small
                  amounts of activation water. Thermal energy (35°C) further
                  mobilizes the gel, leading to better adhesion—albeit at the
                  cost of propagating penetration into the canvas ([[Konietzny
                  2015]]). Elevated temperatures can thus help to reduce the
                  amount of activation water required. Like methylcellulose,
                  sturgeon glue is capable of adhering to various materials,
                  including natural wax ([[Fischer and Eska 2011]]).

                <p>
                  PiBMA Degalan PQ 611 N (formerly Plexigum PQ 611)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  is soluble in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as isooctane
                  or petrol ether without any aromatics. Therefore, acrylic
                  meshes qualify for water-sensitive painting structures, such
                  as canvas that tends to shrink or water-soluble paint layers.
                  Activation of the acrylate requires comparably small amounts
                  of solvents that can be sprayed or vaporized. Lower bond
                  strength can be achieved without solvents by applying elevated
                  temperatures just above the glass transition temperature of
                  33°C ([[Brandt and Volbracht 2018]]). Owing to the brittleness
                  of PiBMA, a stiffening effect occurs when used for canvas
                  bonding. This might be an advantage when the movement of a
                  highly degraded textile support needs to be reduced.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Degalan PQ 611 provides very good adhesion to polar and
                  nonpolar substrates alike, for instance, to both wax
                  ([[Fischer and Eska 2011]]) and cellulosic materials.
                  Concerning long-term material behavior, PiBMA-based adhesives
                  are stable in terms of discoloration, but they may cross-link
                  to a certain amount. Nevertheless, the solubility likely
                  remains in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents with a small
                  proportion of aromatics ([[Feller 1984]]; [[Down 2015]]).
                  However, PiBMA has not yet been processed into stable adhesive
                  meshes due to its brittleness, which would require extensive
                  adjustments to the method.

                  Production of Adhesive Meshes
                </h2>
                <p>
                  So far, we have manually produced sturgeon glue and
                  methylcellulose meshes by using silicone molds. For this
                  purpose, the structure of a polyester monofilament mesh is
                  imprinted in the flattened surface of a kneadable
                  two-component silicone mass. After complete vulcanization, the
                  mesh is taken off and adhesives (in the form of a 20 w/w gel)
                  are filled in using a spatula. Excess material is scraped off.
                  After two to three hours the dried mesh is removed.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This early technique of producing adhesive meshes can easily
                  be implemented with materials available in conservation
                  studios. However, obtaining uniform results is more difficult
                  with respect to mold and mesh shaping. Greater precision and
                  homogeneity can be achieved by computerized numerical control
                  (CNC) machining, such as laser cutting of the silicone molds
                  ([<strong>fig. 28.2</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/28-Konietzny/fig-28-2)).
                  A feasible process for a standardized, larger scale production
                  of adhesive meshes has been refined within the course of the
                  current research project.

                  Application of Adhesive Meshes—Two Case Studies
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The application of adhesive meshes aims at reinforcing
                  degraded canvas with an auxiliary support, such as strip
                  lining, or reattaching of loosened parts along the edges of
                  detached historic linings. The technique was successfully
                  applied in case studies using meshes made from sturgeon glue
                  and methylcellulose. Examples of treated paintings can be
                  found at the Swiss National Museum and the Fondation Beyeler,
                  both in Switzerland, and the Bayerische
                  Staatsgemäldesammlungen in Germany. In addition, different
                  European universities and private conservation studios
                  implemented adhesive meshes for canvas stabilization—and even
                  for full-scale lining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  In the following, two case studies are described to exemplify
                  activation procedures according to the conservation target and
                  the accessibility of the bonding surfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For strip lining, the bonding interfaces are readily
                  accessible. This intervention was realized on a medium-format
                  double-sided canvas painting ([<strong>fig. 28.3</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/28-Konietzny/fig-28-3)).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  A sandwich system of two nonwoven polyester strips was
                  chosen.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  Methylcellulose meshes made from Benecel A4C<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  were used, since high bond strength and adhesive stability in
                  variable environmental conditions were required and the canvas
                  was not sensitive to water. To prepare the bonding material,
                  methylcellulose meshes made with laser cut silicone molds were
                  partly activated by slightly moistening the nonwoven polyester
                  before placing the adhesive meshes on the nonwoven strips and
                  drying them under pressure ([<strong>fig. 28.4</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/28-Konietzny/fig-28-4)).
                  Activation was then initiated by spraying water with a
                  precision pump sprayer ([<strong>fig. 28.5</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/28-Konietzny/fig-28-5)).
                  The meshes were left for ten minutes as methylcellulose takes
                  up water slowly.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  Coverage with a Melinex film without direct contact prevented
                  the meshes from drying (see <strong>fig. 28.5</strong>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The activation process was repeated twice to apply a total
                  amount of about 3 ml water per 100 square centimeters of mesh,
                  resulting in a relatively high water input that was almost
                  completely absorbed by the mesh. To achieve the bonding, the
                  activated strips were then placed below and on top of the
                  tacking margin of the painting’s canvas (see [<strong>fig. 28.3</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/28-Konietzny/fig-28-3))
                  and left to dry for twenty-four hours under pressure (20
                  g/cm²) with blotting paper interleaves. After complete drying,
                  it was possible to pull the tacking margin taut enough to
                  remount the painting on a new stretcher, proving that
                  methylcellulose meshes are capable of generating a
                  sufficiently strong bond between two textiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A different activation approach is necessary when access to
                  the bonding surface is limited. This phenomenon often occurs
                  with lined paintings, such as that shown in [<strong>fig. 28.6</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/28-Konietzny/fig-28-6),
                  where the edge of the original canvas is detached locally from
                  the lining canvas. To maintain the historical lining and
                  stabilize loosened areas, insertion of the adhesive was
                  possible only through small gaps, which is why adhesive meshes
                  provided a suitable approach. Activation has to be carried out
                  quickly to avoid excess water in the painting structure.
                  Therefore, Methocel A15LV meshes and sturgeon glue meshes are
                  suitable due to the short time required and the reduced need
                  for water for activation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The application is identical for both adhesives. To uniformly
                  activate the inserted dry mesh, a nonwoven capillary
                  fabric<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  is used. This material can transport water along its directed
                  fibers and then disperse it onto the mesh. A protrusion of
                  some millimeters allows access for the water to be applied.
                  The adhesive mesh and the capillary fabric are first cut to
                  match the shape of the detachment. Then both the mesh and the
                  capillary fabric are inserted between the canvas layers
                  ([<strong>fig. 28.7</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/28-Konietzny/fig-28-7)).
                  An additional layer of Melinex on top is advisable to protect
                  the original canvas from being wetted, and light weight is
                  used to keep the layers in contact during the procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then water is added onto the nonwoven fabric’s edge until it
                  is completely saturated. Immediately after complete
                  saturation—within about five seconds—the fabric and Melinex
                  are removed with a quick pull to prevent the mesh from
                  sticking to the fabric. Finally, pressure is applied (10
                  g/cm²) until the adhesive has dried. This activation method
                  reduces the amount of water twentyfold compared to the spray
                  activation described above. The resulting bond was found to be
                  strong enough to fix the canvas to the lining fabric anew, yet
                  for reversibility, the lining can easily be peeled off.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  These case studies demonstrate two possible methods of
                  adhesive mesh activation. Further strategies for water or
                  solvent application to accessible bonding surfaces include
                  brushes, especially those with a high absorptive capacity.
                  However, repeated brush applications should be avoided, as the
                  meshes might break, whereas one-time application produces a
                  water film on the mesh without penetrating the underlying
                  canvas. Instead of the nonwoven capillary fabric, other
                  absorptive materials can be used for poorly accessible bonding
                  surfaces. Blotting paper works well for small areas, but since
                  it takes up water rather slowly the risk of sticking to the
                  mesh is higher.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Spray-activated adhesive meshes that were frozen prior to
                  application were also successfully implemented. Frozen meshes
                  are stable for a short period but can be inserted into narrow
                  gaps, where they immediately melt and trigger the bonding.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  Other tools, such as ultrasonic or high-pressure nebulizers
                  and airbrushes, are suitable for both accessible and
                  inaccessible areas. Water drops for a punctual activation can
                  be achieved by microdosing systems. In combination with
                  acrylic meshes, activation with solvent vapor is another
                  feasible option.

                <p>
                  The development of adhesive meshes for canvas bonding aims at
                  minimizing the amount of adhesive and solvent required and
                  achieving a homogenous adhesive distribution, while preserving
                  high reversibility with minimal residues. Commercial lining
                  adhesives suffer from well-known problems, including
                  undisclosed ingredients, changes in formulation, and aging
                  behavior. Adhesives commonly used in painting conservation, on
                  the other hand, tend to comply with decisive criteria such as
                  proven long-term stability and good adhesion to a broad range
                  of common substrates. This has set the choice for their use as
                  suitable mesh materials. Each of the three adhesives
                  chosen—methylcellulose of two viscosity types, sturgeon glue,
                  and PiBMA—exhibits individual qualities for making them
                  suitable for specific applications, and the three available
                  options together cover a broader range of applicable cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The activation technique by which water or solvent is applied
                  as spray, through nonwoven capillary fabrics and the like,
                  ensures excellent control and adjustability of the adhesive
                  bond. Bonding characteristics are determined by activation
                  parameters like amount of water or solvent and optional
                  application of elevated temperatures. So far, the technique
                  using water-soluble adhesive meshes has proved suitable for
                  canvas painting treatments such as lining, strip-lining, and
                  the repair of detached historic linings.

                  To provide adhesive meshes for conservators, a reliable
                  production process for the manufacturing of methylcellulose
                  and sturgeon glue meshes was developed in the recent research
                  project, and these are now provided by APM Technica AG.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
                  Further investigations to evaluate adhesive meshes for canvas
                  bonding will be the focus of an ongoing PhD project<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                  covering activation strategies and bonding characteristics,
                  particularly the adhesive strength and penetration as a
                  function of activation parameters, as well as the long-term
                  behavior of adhesive mesh bonds. The results will provide
                  fundamental application guidelines and help to define the
                  potential of adhesive meshes. Apart from canvas bonding,
                  fixing loose paint<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  and treating other materials, such as textiles<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>
                  or paper,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                  are other application fields that seem highly feasible.

                  Tears and cuts in textile painting supports are often closed
                  with thread-by-thread mending, to reconstruct the mechanical
                  properties and visual appearance. Selected results of tests on
                  adhesives for single-thread bonding in cellulosic fabrics are
                  summarized. The data presented is based on uniaxial tensile
                  tests of bonded canvas strips. The investigation also covers
                  different bonding techniques. Under the wide range of
                  adhesives tested, the most promising types are shown, taking
                  the requirement profile into account. The classic recipe of
                  Winfried Heiber, a mixture of sturgeon glue and wheat-starch
                  paste, as well as dispersions based on PVA and EVA were
                  evaluated. In particular, the reinforcement with cellulose
                  fibers is addressed: investigations about the influence of
                  fiber length of selected commercial Arbocel products, in a
                  mixture with sturgeon glue solution, were carried out. In
                  addition, a new heating device for a controlled application of

                  This contribution from the 2019 Conserving Canvas symposium
                  gives insight into the selection and application of adhesives
                  for the thread-by-thread tear mending method to close tears
                  and cuts in textile supports of canvas paintings. A more
                  accurate term for this method is
                  <em>single-thread bonding technique.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>

                  Single-Thread Bonding Technique
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The single-thread bonding technology has become well
                  established as a minimally invasive alternative for the
                  treatment of local damages in the canvas, in contrast to the
                  application of patches or the lining of paintings. The aim of
                  the method is to restore the mechanical properties and the
                  optical appearance while preserving the inherent properties of
                  the original textile canvas support. Different bonding
                  techniques are used, depending on the damage patterns that
                  form distinct fracture patterns, as shown schematically in
                  <a href="#fig-29-1"><strong>fig. 29.1</strong></a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the case of cuts or very brittle canvas supports, straight
                  fracture edges often occur, occasionally without any local
                  deformations or gaps. Butt joints are the only option for
                  these fracture phenomena since no overlapping of the thread
                  ends can be achieved. Such bonds are weaker than overlapping
                  joints due to their mechanical force transmission. Therefore,
                  individual supplementary bridging threads are often applied
                  onto the back of the canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contrast, overlapping often occurs with “younger,” more
                  “flexible” in the sense of movable, pliable and stretchable
                  canvases: stretched and frayed thread ends enable overlapping
                  joints. In these cases, the thread ends can be arranged one
                  above the other without level displacements, comparable to a
                  scarf joint. The intermingling of the individual fibers of
                  both thread ends while overlapping is ideal: it improves
                  mechanical anchoring, optimizes force transmission and leads
                  to most reliable bonds with less tendency to creep.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The general motivation and procedure, up to the presentation
                  of the individual bonding steps using a stereo microscope and
                  fine instruments, are described in detail elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Depending on the bonding technique and state of degradation,
                  different adhesives are suitable. To achieve the best possible
                  bonding, the adhesive application method must be chosen wisely
                  and individually for each painting.

                  Adhesive Requirements
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The general profile of requirements for adhesives used in tear
                  mending is very complex and appears to be somewhat
                  contradictory.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  In particular, the different adhesion properties of adhesives
                  for fabrics based on cellulosic fibers (e.g., linen, cotton)
                  and fabrics produced from synthetic fibers (e.g., polyester,
                  polyamide) need to be taken into account. Other individual
                  surface properties caused by, for example, impregnation from
                  former linings or glue residues due to removed patches, also
                  influence the adhesion. However, the general criteria for an
                  ideal adhesive can be summarized as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The aim is to achieve, with a minimal dosage of adhesive,
                      a high level of adhesive strength.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The adhesive must completely wet the fibers of the thread
                      ends despite the small amount used.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The bond should have a strength<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                      similar to that of the surrounding thread material. If the
                      bond strength is too high, there is the risk that in the
                      event of mechanical impact the mending will not open, but
                      rather new fractures in the intact fabric adjacent to the
                      joined tear will occur.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The aim is a “mechanical balance” in relation to the
                      canvas properties: The bond should be strong enough to
                      withstand the “normal” tension distribution and maintain
                      the “flexibility” of the threads within the canvas. The
                      stiffness of the bond should be similar to that of the
                      original canvas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>

                    <p>
                      Comparatively high glass transition temperatures are
                      desirable in order to avoid creep at room temperature
                      under continuous load.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                    <p>
                      It is preferable to use adhesives with a neutral pH value
                      in order to prevent acid-induced degradation of the
                      original fibers.

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      A suitable, comparatively high viscosity is needed to
                      avoid the adhesive drifting into the threads. In addition,
                      the highest possible solid contents of the adhesives is
                      sought in order to achieve reliable bonds.

                    <p>
                      Suitable working properties are necessary, in particular
                      an appropriate open and drying time, so that the adhesive
                      “sets” neither too slowly nor too quickly.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The option to re-open of the bond and the reworkability
                      with water are preferred.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In this context, there is also the need for compatibility
                      with subsequent treatments, for example, filling and
                      retouching.

                      Generally, good optical properties are aimed for, such as
                      no gloss or darkening. A mended tear with single thread

                      It should be emphasized that, contrary to frequent
                      publications, thread-by-thread mending cannot be scaled to
                      forecast bond strengths. Initial systematic investigations
                      have already shown that the properties of intact textile
                      structures cannot be easily estimated by simple size
                      scaling, due to their complex structure. Particularly with
                      regard to the establishment of possible correlations
                      between fiber, thread, and fabric structures (uni- as well
                      as biaxial), caution is advisable.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                      Furthermore, strengths of single-thread bonds cannot be
                      easily scaled to estimate, for example, longer tears.
                      Here, it would be necessary to examine the possibilities
                      and limits of scaling correlations first, in order to draw
                      conclusions from tested samples about the painting’s
                      behavior. Ultimately, possible correction factors can be
                      determined and named only in this way. Hence, no
                      conclusions may (yet) be drawn between mended single
                      threads and canvas strips or mended canvas strips of
                      different widths. Unfortunately, it is often found in
                      literature that bond strengths are scaled up, but this
                      provides no reliable conclusions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>

                      Furthermore, only multiple single-thread bonds in canvas
                      specimens should be evaluated. References can be made only
                      to the behavior of the fabric structure, when the
                      single-thread bonding technique is used in canvas samples.
                      All previous results of uniaxially testing single bonded
                      threads allow only the relative comparison of the
                      adhesives with each other in this specific setup.
                      Therefore, the results must be interpreted with caution.
                      Even though they offer credible tendencies as valuable
                      guidance, no reliable data about the tensile strength of
                      mended tears and cuts with multiple bonded threads in
                      canvas paintings has been presented.

                      Uniaxial tensile tests on canvas strips are comparatively
                      easy to carry out and allow one to make an initial
                      assessment. However, there is usually biaxial tensile
                      stress in the stretched painting. First uniaxial and
                      biaxial short-term tests are suitable for depicting
                      extreme values of the bonds with regard to maximum tensile
                      force and elongation, and thus to draw first general
                      comparisons among adhesives or bonding techniques.
                      Ultimately, however, there is a deviating long-term load
                      in a permanently stretched painting. Only by testing the
                      bonds in the biaxial long-term structure,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                      can the durability and reliability of the bonds be
                      observed, as well as, for example, the extent to which
                      bonds exhibit (disadvantageous) viscous creep tendencies.

                      In general, material tests should have a strong practical
                      relevance, from which recommendations for treatments and
                      materials can be derived. Consequently, the evaluation of
                      materials and measures should be linked as closely as
                      possible to the subsequent application. This results in
                      the need to test single-thread bonding not only in biaxial
                      long-term tests but ideally also in the coated fabric
                      composite, that is in the closest possible approximation
                      to different painting conditions.

                  This paper focuses on adhesives for canvases made from
                  cellulosic flax fibers. Previous investigations into different
                  adhesives have taken place, in particular on the basis of
                  bonded single threads which have been uniaxially tensile
                  tested, for example, modifications of sturgeon glue,
                  dispersions based on acrylates, polyvinyl acetates (PVA) or
                  ethylene vinyl acetates (EVA), hot melt adhesives or epoxy
                  resins were tested.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  It should be noted that not all of these material groups are
                  equally suitable and that the properties also differ within
                  the groups, depending on the specific adhesive and its

                  The uniaxially tested fabric strips were 12 threads wide, and

                  reproducible overlap of 1 mm was selected for the test series.
                  For butt joints, the two thread ends were positioned without
                  any visible gap, as close as possible, for bonding. A uniform
                  adhesive volume per thread (0.6 µm adhesive droplet) was used

                  types of tests are dependent on the parameters selected, so
                  that absolute measured values must always be embedded in the

                  characterized not only by the highest possible maximum tensile
                  forces (in the short-term test): the viscous, time-dependent
                  material properties of canvas paintings and single-thread
                  bonds, even with much lower long-term exposure, are ultimately

                  Since the test series have been repeated several times over
                  the last years, two average measured F~max~ values are shown
                  in <a href="#fig-29-2"><strong>fig. 29.2</strong></a>. For each of the different adhesives and bonding techniques,
                  the lowest and highest F~max~ mean values from all test series
                  up to 2019 are presented. The order does not correspond to any
                  chronological sequence. Although the exact same test setup and
                  experimental design (test specimen preparation, testing,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  and evaluation) were always followed, and at least ten to
                  twenty test specimens of one type were tested each time, the
                  average mean values are hardly reproducible due to scattering
                  results.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because <strong>fig. 29.2</strong> shows overall low and high
                  average measured values, standard deviations as absolute
                  scatter measures in the diagrams were omitted. Instead,
                  <a href="#fig-29-3"><strong>fig. 29.3</strong></a> shows the
                  relative coefficients of variation corresponding to
                  <strong>fig. 29.2</strong>. The variation coefficients of
                  F~max~ lie within a range of approximately 6%–30% (in one case
                  almost 40%), which corresponds to quite a large range of
                  individual measured values from which the mean value is
                  derived. In comparison, the variation coefficient of intact
                  canvas samples shows a value of only approximately 6%, which
                  probably results from variations in the natural fiber and the
                  canvas production. Therefore, bonding causes the scattering of
                  the measured values of all adhesives tested.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Extensive investigations into this problem made clear that the
                  scattering is to be regarded as inherent in the technology:
                  irrespective of the greatest possible standardization of the
                  substrate to be bonded, there are always unknown differences
                  in the individual sectional structure, geometry, length,
                  torsion and porosity of fibers and threads. All these aspects
                  result in different wetting, penetration and formation of the
                  adhesive joint and its interphases as well as in different
                  mechanical behavior under tensile testing, even with a
                  standardized quantity and application of the adhesive.
                  Thread-by-thread mends inevitably scatter in their bond
                  strengths. In practice, conservators must therefore always
                  consider both the best case and the worst case, since the
                  strengths of single-thread bonds can differ.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>

                  To aid the clarity of the figure scaling, the intact
                  references without bonds are not shown in
                  <a href="#fig-29-2"><strong>fig. 29.2</strong></a>: the F~max~ of the intact canvas strips was approximately
                  270 N on arithmetic mean.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                  The average F~max~ of the bonded joints, using the four
                  different adhesives in different joining situations, is always
                  less than the strength of the intact canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Regarding the different types of bonding, a successive
                  increase can be noted for all adhesives from butt joints to
                  butt joints with bridging threads to simple overlapping joints
                  and to overlapping joints with intermingled fibers of the
                  thread ends. The enlargement of the bonding surface and
                  mechanical anchoring result in an improved force transmission
                  and thus higher maximum strengths.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hence, overlapping bonds are more reliable than butt joint
                  bonds and should therefore be preferred in principle. In case
                  of overlap joints, care should be taken to ensure good
                  mechanical anchoring and intermingling of the fibers of the
                  two thread ends. Simply joining the thread ends on top of each
                  other leads to a weaker bond. The minimum overlap is
                  considered to be approximately 0.5 mm.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>
                  Shorter overlaps should be regarded and treated as butt
                  joints. If possible, butt joints should be secured and
                  stabilized with additional bridging threads. This also ensures
                  a gentler tear opening in the event of adhesive failure.

                  Adhesive Evaluation
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Butt joints without an overlap are the most challenging bonds,
                  due to lower tensile strengths. In the past, these cases were
                  frequently bonded with epoxy resins, which are rigid,
                  irreversible and sometimes become brittle due to ageing.
                  Today, more suitable adhesives have been found. However, the
                  Heiber’s “classic mixture” of sturgeon glue and wheat starch
                  paste is not suitable for this bonding technique,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>
                  as is shown in
                  <a href="#fig-29-4"><strong>fig. 29.4</strong></a>, which represents a simplified section of data from
                  <a href="#fig-29-2"><strong>fig. 29.2</strong></a>. Particularly high bond strengths on butt joints could be
                  achieved with the mixture of sturgeon glue and cellulose
                  fibers. At the same time, this adhesive mixture is also less
                  suitable for overlapping-intermingled bonding techniques,
                  since the bonds quickly turn out to be too strong. The
                  condition of the painting or canvas must always be taken into
                  account: very brittle, degraded fabrics may also be too weak
                  for the application of this adhesive mixture in butt joint
                  technology. In such cases, it may be advisable to switch to
                  the pH-neutral EVA dispersion Lineco with cellulose ether
                  additive (cellulose fibers can also be added here, for
                  additional reinforcement and minimization of creep
                  tendencies).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The stabilization of butt joints by using bridging threads
                  applied to the back can be recommended due to the significant
                  increase in the average bond strength as well as slower
                  opening in the event of adhesive failure. It is important to
                  point out that the mechanical requirements for bridging
                  threads are completely different to the ones for single-thread
                  bonding: adhesives used for thread-by-thread mending would be
                  too stiff and “inflexible” in terms of a low ductility for
                  bridging threads. Such bridges can become detached or, in the
                  worst case, cause out-of-plane deformations. Bridging threads
                  should function as a “flexible” additional force transmission
                  line and support the stronger, actual bond. The main force
                  transmission should take place in the bonded original thread
                  material. The bridging threads should serve only as an
                  additional transmission line through shear force interaction,
                  and not be explicitly chosen to be stiffening or similar
                  through the choice of material. Ideally, this requires a
                  rather soft, stretchable adhesive that can react in a
                  compensating manner to movements of the textile support. Good
                  adhesion with comparatively weak cohesion under high
                  elongations, as in the case of thermoplastic reactivation of
                  Beva 371 film (25 µm film in the test series), is ideal. As an
                  alternative, the liquid pH neutral EVA dispersion Evacon-R
                  (with optional addition of methyl-cellulose ether) could be
                  considered for very rigid fabric structures. Dried Evacon-R
                  films are less stretchable in comparison and are resoluble in
                  water in terms of reversibility.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>
                  Acrylic dispersions might also be an option, though they are
                  known to be unsuitable for single-thread bonding<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>
                  due to their comparatively soft and extensible properties.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Wherever possible, the fibers of the thread ends should be
                  intermingled in overlapping bonding to achieve a larger
                  bonding surface, improved mechanical anchoring, and optimized
                  force transmission. As far as the final adhesive selection is
                  concerned, the painting and fabric requirements are decisive:
                  in practice, the Heiber recipe sturgeon glue–wheat starch
                  paste mixture has become established for
                  overlapping-intermingled bonding. With this classic adhesive,
                  more degraded fabrics can also be bonded, while the
                  cellulose-ether modified dispersions Lineco and Mowilith DHS
                  S1 may allow also higher bond strengths for more stable fabric
                  conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On some fabrics, strong darkening or gloss formation can occur
                  when using the mixture of sturgeon glue and wheat starch
                  paste. The presented synthetic resin dispersions modified with
                  methyl-cellulose ether may help in these cases. Under
                  especially high stresses or higher temperatures, the
                  homopolymeric PVA dispersion Mowilith DHS S1 might be
                  preferred to the copolymeric EVA dispersion Lineco due to
                  expected lower creep tendencies.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>
                  The sturgeon glue-cellulose fiber-adhesive tested is
                  unsuitable for overlapping-intermingled bonding as it can
                  result in a bond strength that is too high, especially in aged
                  and degraded canvases. Furthermore, a reduction in the amount
                  of adhesive to counter this problem is problematic, as
                  complete wetting of the thread adherends is essential for
                  reliable bonding. Modifications of the adhesive formulation of
                  sturgeon glue-cellulose fiber-adhesives, by reducing the
                  sturgeon glue concentration and/or changing the fiber type,
                  also proved not to be suitable for overlapping-intermingled
                  bonding.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>

                  The mixture of sturgeon glue and Arbocel fibers is a
                  comparatively new adhesive that can compete even with
                  presumably strong epoxy resins.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>
                  Arbocel cellulose fibers are high-purity industrial products
                  and are available in various lengths and thicknesses. This
                  quality and standardization has many advantages over
                  individually cut linen fibers. In the presented tests, Arbocel
                  BWW 40 with a fiber length of 200 µm was used. Flock also
                  investigated the question of whether shorter or longer fibers,
                  or a mix, could also be suitable as fillers to improve
                  embedding and force transmission properties, using canvas
                  strips with butt joints for uniaxial short-term testing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup>
                  The basic recipe of a 25% sturgeon glue solution and added
                  cellulose fibers (20:1 by weight) was tested.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The results show the weakest bond strengths when using very
                  short (Arbocel BC 600-30, average length 40 µm) and,
                  especially, very long fiber types (Arbocel BC 200, average
                  length 300 µm), as can be seen in
                  <a href="#fig-29-5"><strong>fig. 29.5</strong></a>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup>
                  Therefore, these types are less suitable as adhesive fillers
                  for achieving high bond strengths in butt joints. The sturgeon
                  glue mixtures with pure Arbocel types of medium fiber lengths
                  (B 00, B 800, BWW 40) are quite comparable with regard to the
                  achieved bond strengths and averaged total strains of the test
                  specimens.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup>
                  The fiber length of 200 µm (Arbocel BWW 40) should be
                  highlighted, as it seems to enable an ideal compromise in
                  embedding and force transmission. The mixture has been in
                  regular use at CICS since 2014 for butt joints in textile
                  painting supports and has proven itself as an alternative to
                  epoxy resins, especially for cuts.

                <p>
                  The investigated fiber blends show a similar mechanical
                  behavior to the original recipe only with fibers of type BWW
                  40: for this purpose, 1:1 mixtures (by weight) of Arbocel BWW
                  40 with a type of shorter fiber length were produced. The
                  differences in the test results due to mixing with the types
                  BC 600-30 (40 µm), B 00 (120 µm) and B 800 (130 µm) were
                  marginal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup>
                  The different recipes, whether the pure fiber types of medium
                  length or the other mixtures mentioned, show slightly
                  different viscosities. Thus, in individual cases, depending on
                  the required processing properties, it is possible to use one
                  of these alternatives instead of the proven type Arbocel BWW
                  40.

                <p>
                  The choice of a suitable application method has a particularly
                  high influence on the reliable and constant quality of bonds,
                  as well as the reduction of the scattering of the bonding
                  qualities in the case of sturgeon glue-cellulose
                  fiber-mixtures. The successful application of, especially,
                  those adhesive mixtures containing fibers is directly linked
                  to the correct application. Therefore, use of the newly
                  developed Consolidation Pen Winnie is recommended as an
                  application method for sturgeon glue-cellulose fiber-adhesives
                  (<a href="#29-6"><strong>fig. 29.6</strong></a>). The Consolidation Pen Winnie was used for standardized
                  adhesive application of 0.6 µl droplets in the tests to
                  examine the influence of different cellulose fiber lengths.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The standardized application of small adhesive droplets of
                  comparable volume, especially for adhesives that are applied
                  warmer than room temperature, is typically a great challenge.
                  This is especially true for the sturgeon glue-cellulose
                  fiber-mixture since the uniform fiber distribution in the
                  adhesive droplet presents an additional difficulty. For
                  example, an initial test series in 2015 produced highly
                  inhomogeneous results without any conclusive reference to the
                  properties of the different Arbocel types. In the course of
                  the error analysis, it became clear that the previous
                  application by means of a microdosage device<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup>
                  caused excessive fluctuations in the fiber content and
                  therefore had to be optimized. After numerous preliminary
                  tests and extensive product development, a heat-able sleeve
                  for a mini-syringe with a low-binding pipette tip was
                  developed by Star Tec Products, which enables the dosing of
                  finest adhesive droplets of constant volume and homogeneous

                  The Consolidation Pen Winnie, named after the pioneer of
                  thread-by-thread mending, Winfried Heiber, is a heat sleeve in
                  which aqueous adhesive solutions can be heated in a special
                  syringe. The temperature of the heating sleeve (which contains
                  the heating element) can be regulated with the control unit,
                  as shown in <a href="#fig-29-6"><strong>fig. 29.6</strong></a>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup>
                  The heatable adhesive application device allows for precise
                  and fast application of even highly concentrated animal glue
                  solutions, including, for example, 20–30% solid content
                  sturgeon glue and mixtures with wheat starch paste or Arbocel
                  cellulose fibers. The great advantage is that despite heating,
                  the adhesive concentration in the syringe does not change. The
                  Consolidation Pen Winnie can be comfortably operated with one
                  hand without any appreciable effort, as shown in
                  <a href="#fig-29-7"><strong>fig. 29.7</strong></a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The highlight that makes the Winnie a precision instrument is
                  the selected low-binding pipette tip: its special conical
                  shape ensures fine dosing. The transparent plastic nozzle made
                  of polypropylene ensures a controllable material discharge at
                  the approximately 0.8 mm diameter opening. This special
                  low-binding tip, inert and coming from pipetting “long sticky
                  molecules” in microbiology,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup>
                  is indispensable for the application of finest droplets of
                  highly viscous adhesive solutions, as the comparison with
                  numerous cannulas and other pipette tips showed. The syringe
                  and pipette tip are connected with a silicone tube. This
                  simple connection provides sufficient tightness and stability
                  for safe removal of the entire adhesive syringe from the
                  heating sleeve. At the same time, quick assembly and
                  disassembly is ensured.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The entire adhesive application takes place directly at the
                  damaged area under the stereo microscope.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup>
                  This is accompanied by a more relaxed and rapid bonding
                  process. The adhesive is transferred from the tip of the
                  pipette to the thread ends with a polystyrene strip or a
                  Weston probe (see
                  <a href="#fig-29-7"><strong>fig. 29.7</strong></a>). In some cases, for example, with particularly large thread
                  diameters, the adhesive can be dripped or placed directly onto
                  the thread ends with the pipette tip. The adhesive flow, and
                  thus the droplet size at the pipette tip, can be regulated by
                  the pressure on the syringe plunger and, to a certain degree,
                  by temperature control. The incorporation of the adhesive
                  between the fibers with fine instruments remains indispensable
                  in case of closing tears and cuts in canvas supports.

                <p>
                  The Consolidation Pen Winnie was initially developed for
                  single-thread bonding to close tears and cuts in canvas

                  for canvas supports. Further investigations will show to what
                  extent the new adhesive application method with the Winnie
                  will influence the future choice of adhesive for single-thread
                  bonding. The Winnie system opens the possibility that gelatin
                  might be considered for the first time as an adhesive for tear
                  mending: possibly suitable gelatin types are still to be

                  Up to now, the low gel temperature of sturgeon glue was
                  indispensable for the traditional application method in
                  practical conservation, the transfer of the adhesive from a
                  small glass jar outside the painting with the head of an
                  insect pin. This application technique has many disadvantages
                  and can now be avoided in the future.

                <p>
                  Depending on the state of degradation and fracture pattern of
                  a canvas, different bonding techniques and adhesives will be
                  suitable for the thread-by-thread tear mending technique to
                  close tears and cuts. The bond strengths of butt joints are
                  significantly weaker than the ones with overlapping joints. In
                  the case of overlapping thread ends, intermingling of the
                  fibers is recommended to generate particularly high bonding
                  qualities.
                </p>

                  In a comprehensive series of tests, four adhesives proved to
                  be particularly suitable for common cellulose-based textile
                  supports. The mixture of sturgeon glue and wheat starch paste
                  as well as the two synthetic resin dispersions, pH neutral
                  adhesive Lineco (EVA) and Mowilith (PVA), both modified with
                  Methocel A4C cellulose ether, are suitable for
                  overlapping-intermingled bonding. The two modified dispersion
                  adhesives are also suitable for butt joint bonding. For high
                  tensile strength of butt joints, the mixture of sturgeon glue
                  with cellulose fibers (specifically Arbocel BWW 40), is
                  recommended. Furthermore, butt joints should be additionally
                  stabilized with bridging threads. For bridging threads, other
                  adhesives than for tear mending should be used: especially
                  suitable is Beva 371 (25 µm film).

                  Single-thread bonds are subject to technical and material
                  immanent scatterings, which must be taken into account. To
                  reduce the fluctuation range of the bond qualities, a suitable
                  method of applying the adhesives is essential. For the warmed
                  sturgeon glue mixtures, especially the modification with
                  cellulose fibers, the Consolidation Pen Winnie is highly
                  recommended.

                        Several authors have described adhesive criteria,

                      <p>
                        It is often stated as a rule of thumb that the adhesive
                        should have a lower cohesion than the original fabric to
                        prevent further damage, so that the bonded joint opens
                        instead of new defects forming. However, this
                        requirement must be specified to the effect that the
                        resulting bond must have a lower cohesion than the
                        surrounding material. This is of great relevance, as the
                        adhesive behavior in the joint sometimes differs greatly
                        from the pure adhesive material (compare to [[Flock
                        2014, 134–35]]). Thus, for example, both increased and
                        reduced, of previously assumed, bond strengths can occur
                        (based on the pure adhesive properties). Adhesive and
                        cohesive behavior are therefore to be understood and
                        considered as mutually influencing (compare to [[Flock
                        2020, 46–47]]).

                        Especially regarding the often hygroscopic behavior of
                        fabric, the bond achieved should have a certain
                        tolerance to stress changes caused by climatic changes
                        as well as transports of artworks or the like. The
                        bonded area ideally accompanies the fabric’s movements
                        instead of promoting local tension differences and thus
                        markings. Hygroscopic adhesive properties are therefore
                        often preferred. In this context, the rather fuzzy term
                        of <em>required flexibility</em> is often used. It would
                        certainly be desirable that the adhesive joint behaves
                        in the sense of spontaneous, completely reversible shape
                        change (elasticity, comparable to an ideal constant
                        spring). However, a certain flexibility in the sense of
                        adaptive behavior, which can have viscous or even
                        plastic-ductile components within certain limits, is
                        sometimes sufficient. Slight viscous creep tendencies of
                        adhesives, which are similar to those of the original
                        fabric, are therefore not necessarily a disadvantage, as
                        long as the transfer of force through the bond can be
                        guaranteed and no deformations or the like result.
                        Brittle properties should be avoided. Elastic or
                        “flexible” automatically leads to the need for suitable
                        stiffness, that is, the corresponding resistance to
                        (elastic) deformation: the adhesive joint should not be
                        too soft or stretchy and should be able to transfer
                        stresses without deformation. At the same time, overly
                        rigid bonds should be avoided. Here in particular, the
                        idea of the ideal adhesive material, which is sometimes
                        perceived as contradictory, becomes clear. However,
                        there is not so much a contradiction as a very specific,
                        individual ideal that depends on the object, and is thus
                        a hardly achievable mechanical property profile (compare
                        to [[Flock 2020|, 47–48]]).

                        quantifiable evaluation of the bond behavior. For this
                        purpose, a tensile frame was developed that allows
                        constant biaxial tensile loading of the samples; digital
                        image correlation (DIC) is used for local and global

                        Among the PVA dispersions considered, Mowilith DHS S1
                        showed satisfactory film properties, particularly
                        homogeneous adhesive properties, and very good
                        processing characteristics. It formed the most reliable

                        Winfried Heiber’s technique
                        <em>Geweberasterhaftung</em> (fabric grid bonding): the
                        melting of the thin adhesive film with a hot air gun
                        leads to adhesive-free interstices and an accumulation
                        of adhesive on the surface of the threads ([[Heiber

                        The specification of tensions for textile painting
                        supports is problematic: values given in conservation
                        literature usually cannot be compared or generally
                        transferred. The cross sections of the painting’s layers
                        are not known, therefore, a substitute “line-stress,”
                        related to the fabric’s width (N/m), is often given.
                        However, this value is given regardless of the
                        individual structure; for example, details about the
                        weave and fabric, type and homogeneity of the upper
                        layers, or interaction of the layers, are not taken into
                        account. Furthermore, with fabrics there are also
                        concrete uncertainties when using the stress term, due
                        to the “open-pored” structure: the fibers, which are
                        made up from individual fibrils, are twisted together to
                        form the threads. The threads, depending on the type of
                        weave, interact at binding points (friction), or leave
                        free interstices. In fact, there is no continuum, either
                        in the individual thread, or in the fabric. Strictly
                        speaking, no tension as stress can be defined. Hence,
                        the approximation of the fabric as a continuous layer
                        represents a high degree of abstraction. For this
                        reason, also in textile technology and testing, the
                        calculation of cross-sectional stresses (N/mm²) is
                        uncommon. Instead, the maximum tensile forces (N) or the
                        width-related maximum tensile force (N/m) are often used
                        (compare to [[Flock 2020|, 34]] and [[Flock et al.
                        2022|, 199]]). However, such absolute values must always
                        be embedded in the context of their details and cannot
                        be used for simple comparisons of different sources, as
                        is unfortunately still done (see, for example,
                        [[Michalski 2022|, 230–31]]). The authors would like to
                        distance themselves explicitly from such compilations.

                        The testing parameters of all mended samples as well as

                        and test speed rate of 20 mm/min (compare to [[Flock et

                        suitable, increased pre-load of 1 N was implemented
                        ([[Flock 2020|, 62–63]]).

                        The tested reference canvas strips were each 12 threads
                        wide or approximately 12.5 mm fabric width. Although a
                        certain scaling effect can be seen for intact fabrics
                        ([[Flock 2014|, 84]]), it should not be concluded that
                        270&nbsp;N per 12.5&nbsp;mm leads to a maximum load capacity of
                        ~21,600&nbsp;N/m. Nevertheless, it is clear that even 270&nbsp;N/m
                        is a value to which many canvas paintings are probably
                        not permanently exposed.

                        The minimum overlap of 0.5 mm is according to Winfried
                        Heiber ([[Heiber 1996|, 132–33]]): as a rule of thumb,
                        the longer the overlap, the better for reliable bonding.
                        In practice, the minimum overlap also depends on the
                        thread structure, such as the shape and number of
                        individual fibers and the thread thickness.

                        The mixture of sturgeon glue and wheat starch paste is
                        also unsuitable for simple overlapping joints, due to
                        the sensitivity of the bonds to shear stress: here, the

                        According to Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
                        (FTIR) analyses by Elisabeth Jägers, the copolymeric EVA
                        dispersion Evacon-R has a much higher proportion of
                        ethylene, which acts as an internal plasticizer.
                        Therefore, Evacon-R is much more stretchable and softer

                        The Consolidation Pen Winnie comes with two sizes of
                        syringes (0.5 ml and 1 ml): the maximum internal
                        temperature is approximately 63°C–68°C. The precise fit
                        of the reusable syringe allows optimal heat transfer.
                        Syringes with a diameter of up to about 6.5 mm can be
                        inserted. The use of a particularly short syringe is
                        extremely handy, with a maximum length of approximately
                        11 cm including plunger. The flow and droplet formation
                        of the adhesive solution are caused by the extremely low
                        pressure of the syringe plunger. All the individual
                        parts described, for example, syringes, low-binding
                        pipette tips, and silicone tube, are included in the
                        Winnie starter kit.

                        Exemplarily, Flock considered mixtures of one type of
                        gelatin: a gelatin typically used in other contexts of
                        conservation practice was included in the adhesive
                        selection (Gelita Imagel 185 Bloom, inert photographic
                        gelatin, pH 5), to be specifically compared with
                        sturgeon glue. The selected gelatin type showed
                        significantly lower bond strengths and increased
                        scattering ranges when mixed with wheat starch paste and
                        cellulose fibers, and therefore cannot be preferred. Due
                        to the large number of different gelatins, however, this
                        cannot be understood as generally representative. A more
                        suitable type of gelatin could therefore still be found
                        for alternative use in single-thread bonding ([[Flock
                        2020|, 85–86, 145–46]]).

                  The practice of minimal intervention came about as a response
                  to invasive and prophylactic treatments of the past. Since it
                  is the principal responsibility of the conservator to
                  intervene, perhaps a better term would be
                  <em>targeted intervention</em>.&nbsp;The paper seeks to illustrate
                  how two adages, “Occam’s razor” and “the law of the
                  instrument” can help define a more targeted strategy where
                  standard procedures can be simplified by both reexamining the
                  causes of damage and modifying tools to better suit the task.
                  Originally conceived as a slide presentation with multiple
                  images, the intent of this paper is to encourage a generation
                  of developing conservators to trust in their own hand skills
                  and knowledge. Examples illustrate that by employing critical
                  thinking and ingenuity, simple and more direct solutions can
                  often be found to replace formulaic methodology and
                  sophisticated equipment.

                  The 1974 Greenwich Conference on Comparative Lining Techniques
                  might be called the seminal meeting for the field of painting
                  conservation in the twentieth century. Implicit was an
                  international agreement that the craft-oriented methods used
                  for the structural treatment of paintings in the past,
                  specifically lining paintings, be reviewed in the context of
                  scientific investigation, and that new, informed methods must
                  be adopted for our profession to evolve and avoid the mistakes
                  of the past.

                  New tools like vacuum hot tables, low-pressure suction tables,
                  and regulated humidity chambers were being developed and
                  employed. Modern technology offered an expanding variety of
                  new synthetic materials, which were being anxiously embraced,
                  along with high-tech testing methods to evaluate these
                  materials. All of this elicited excitement and confidence in
                  all that was new to our profession. However, an underlying
                  movement was stirring as well, mostly associated with a
                  conservator named Westby Percival-Prescott, who was concerned
                  about the notion that we must act prophylactically, and that
                  we may be simply replacing the how and what without first
                  addressing the why. ([[Villers 2003b]]).

                  Over the next couple of decades, a more cautious approach
                  known as “Minimal Intervention” was becoming the mantra of
                  more and more painting conservators. When I began my training
                  in the mid-1980s, I was one of the young converts to this
                  approach, even though some of my mentors considered Prescott
                  an alarmist whose call for “a lining moratorium” was holding
                  back progress in our field. While Prescott was advocating for
                  caution and further investigation into both the efficacy and
                  unintended consequences of lining, other critics soon came
                  forward with much more scathing accusations of conservators
                  destroying artworks due to their lack of connoisseurship and a
                  rush to adopt new materials and methods ([[Walden 1985]];
                  [[Beck and Daley 1994]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  A cadre of conservators were similarly advocating for what
                  might be described as a gentler approach to treating
                  paintings. Take, for example, the 1988 American Institute for
                  Conservation (AIC) meeting in New Orleans. Sandwiched between
                  the presentation of technical reports by two engineers, Gustav
                  Berger and Marion Mecklenberg, Lance Mayer and Gay Myers
                  presented a paper titled “Thoughts on Unlined Paintings.” In
                  this presentation they pondered “the ways in which
                  conservators wrestle…with the actual treatment of unlined
                  paintings” ([[Mayer and Myers 1988|, 222]]) and stated that
                  “The trend toward treating paintings conservatively
                  implies…changing ways of thinking…[toward]…minimal treatment
                  of problems as they develop, rather than thinking that any
                  conservation treatment can solve all of a painting’s past,
                  present and future problems” ([[Mayer and Myers 1988|, 227]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Probably the conservator most associated with this minimal
                  approach was Winfried Heiber (<a href="#fig-30-1"><strong>fig. 30.1</strong></a>), a mentor for many students and like-minded colleagues even
                  before he became a professor at the Hochschule für Bildende
                  Künste (Academy of Fine Arts) Dresden. Today the “Heiber
                  method” of tear mending is widely accepted as the primary
                  technique for avoiding the “need” to line a torn painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Oddly enough, through my discussions with Heiber over the
                  years, he rejected the term minimal intervention to describe
                  the philosophy he followed, pointing out that simply adhering
                  a new canvas to the reverse of a painting, and then filling
                  and retouching a tear, could be considered <em>less</em> of an
                  actual intervention than manipulating each thread of a tear
                  and addressing all of the physical demands and tensile
                  stresses throughout the multiple layers of a torn painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His approach might better be described as targeted
                  intervention. The goal is to treat the damage locally, restore
                  each and every layer of the painting, and limit the work to
                  the specific area of damage. His process could almost be
                  described as putting time in reverse to bring the painting
                  back to a predamaged state. At the Tear Repair Seminar and
                  Workshop held at the Art Institute of Chicago September 7–9,
                  2000, Heiber compared a lined painting to a Ming Dynasty vase
                  filled with cement and placed on a shelf. He observed that
                  while it might be next to impossible to break the vase and
                  that the cement remains visibly undetectable to the viewer,
                  the inherent nature of the vase had been terribly compromised.
                  In broader terms, he would remind us that one thing to be
                  cherished about most paintings is their inherent fragility.

                  The subtitle of this paper is based on two common adages. The
                  first is the law of the instrument: “When all you have is a
                  hammer, everything looks like a nail”—a caution against
                  letting the tool define the treatment rather than the
                  treatment defining the tool. The second is Occam’s razor:
                  “When faced with a problem, the simplest solution is usually
                  the best.” Applied to conservation treatments, this translates
                  to providing simple but effective solutions by looking more
                  closely into the materials and actual mechanics of how
                  something becomes damaged.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This paper presents some simplified methods and tools I have
                  either developed or modified to facilitate local, targeted
                  structural treatments of canvas paintings.
                </p>
                <h2 id="work-stretchers" tabindex="-1">Work Stretchers</h2>
                <p>
                  Work stretchers can be indispensable when treating tented
                  paint caused by a shrunken canvas, particularly when the
                  damage is in an area where the stretcher bars get in the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The diagram in
                  <a href="#fig-30-2"><strong>fig. 30.2</strong></a> illustrates
                  the design of a work stretcher developed by Herr Heiber. The
                  painting’s tacking margins are flattened and clamped between
                  two padded wood blocks. On the end of one of each pair of
                  blocks is a nylon strap by which the painting is suspended in
                  a stretcher. This modular work stretcher is made from sections
                  of aluminum with wood edges. The painting can be tensioned
                  overall in the four corners using a hex wrench or locally by
                  pulling the straps and restapling them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I modified the system to avoid flattening the tacking margins
                  by flipping the blocks over and turning them on edge. Since
                  the tension is equilibrial, the tacking margins will remain at
                  a right angle (see
                  <a href="#fig-30-3"><strong>fig. 30.3</strong></a>). Alternatively, easily sourced items (such as Hollytex,
                  packaging tape and bulldog clips) can be used to suspend
                  paintings in standard artist’s stretchers (<a href="#fig-30-3"><strong>fig. 30.3</strong></a>). Beva film is applied to the Hollytex and the stretcher to
                  ensure the tape sticks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Often, damage is seen only along the bottom of a painting. In
                  these cases, only the bottom stretcher member may need to be
                  removed. A stretcher can be assembled to “hug” the three
                  unaffected sides—either clamped together or held with mending
                  plates. (Tip: place holes where they can be reused for the
                  backing board).

                  Relaxing Tented Paint
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Heiber modified the so-called burnt finger technique commonly
                  used to treat tenting paint (<a href="#fig-30-4"><strong>fig. 30.4</strong></a>). After infusing the canvas with an adhesive (usually wax
                  works best), a light bulb is used on the reverse of the canvas
                  to liquify the adhesive and stretch out a small area of canvas
                  so that the paint can be set down without overlap using
                  pressure from a padded clay shaper—or better yet, silicone
                  shapers or a handmade Teflon tool. After a day’s work, tension
                  is increased along the bottom member to reduce the bulges
                  created by the light bulb. The light bulb can be attached to a
                  handle to extend your reach and a spoon attached to the
                  opposite side to provide a cool surface for the adhesive to
                  set under pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another alternative that is particularly useful when the reach
                  is just too far is to use a watch glass to press on the back
                  of the canvas (<a href="#fig-30-5"><strong>fig. 30.5</strong></a>). A board is cut to fit behind the back of the painting, and
                  two lengths of twill tape, running vertically and
                  horizontally, are taped to the bottom of the glass. A piece of
                  silicone-release Mylar is placed over the glass to cover the
                  entire surface. When the painting is in place, the twill tape
                  can be used to move the glass without excessively moving the
                  painting. (The painting is slightly lifted each time the watch
                  glass is moved, and then gently set down.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next, adhesive is locally fed into cracks and under lifting
                  paint while a hot-air tool and silicone shaper are used to set
                  the paint down on the front. To remove the distortion created
                  by the watch glass, a reptile warming mat (purchased at a pet
                  store) is placed behind the painting. A piece of
                  silicone-release Mylar is used to protect the painting and a
                  small sandbag weight is used for pressure (<a href="#fig-30-6"><strong>fig. 30.6</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <h2 id="suction-platen" tabindex="-1">Suction Platen</h2>
                <p>
                  A suction platen may be the most versatile tool for local
                  interventions. My design has a thin profile to fit under
                  stretcher members and a baffle system inside to keep the
                  suction even across the surface (<a href="#fig-30-7"><strong>fig. 30.7</strong></a>). The 8 x 8 inch size keeps it lightweight while maintaining
                  a usable surface area and allowing it to fit within most
                  stretchers, even those with tight crossbars. The advantages
                  over full-size suction tables include nimbleness and ease of
                  treating smaller areas. Furthermore, the tacking margins need
                  not be flattened and rebent.

                  Retensioning Tears
                </h2>
                <p>
                  While the Trecker, designed by Heiber ([[Demuth and Heiber
                  2000]]) is very useful for pulling the edges of tears
                  together, its weight and size can make using it awkward,
                  particularly in tight spots close to the stretcher bars.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As seen in <a href="#fig-30-8"><strong>fig. 30.8</strong></a> a
                  simple aluminum corner brace can be attached directly to the
                  stretcher, with a piece of Fome-Cor used as a spacer so that
                  the edge of the aluminum does not quite touch the reverse of
                  the canvas. Then a thin piece of plastic G‑10 is slipped under
                  the stretcher to protect the canvas from the edge of the
                  aluminum. Unwaxed dental floss is attached to opposing sides
                  of the tear with either Beva film or Command strips, and then
                  threaded under the aluminum. Pushpins are tied to the other
                  ends of the threads. Tension can then be incrementally
                  increased to bring the edges of the tear together by pulling
                  on and repositioning the pins.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alternatively, a small board can be clamped to the inside of
                  the stretcher to avoid putting any holes in the painting
                  stretcher, as shown in the mock-up in
                  <a href="#fig-30-8"><strong>fig. 30.8</strong></a>. Screws can be used in place of the pushpins, with the
                  threads wound around the screws. The tension can then be
                  increased with greater control by slightly turning the screws.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <a href="#fig-30-9"><strong>Fig. 30.9</strong></a> includes
                  before-treatment details of a large painting (60 × 90 inches)
                  with a small but fairly distorted tear where this technique
                  was applied. Where only one or two threads are needed to pull
                  a small puncture together, bent mending plates (as seen in
                  <a href="#fig-30-8"><strong>fig. 30.8</strong></a>) can be used instead of angled aluminum edging or fabricated
                  Treckers*.*
                </p>
                <p>
                  A suction platen was used during the tear mending to humidify
                  the area to remove planar distortions, and again while
                  filling. Using the platen at low suction during filling allows
                  the wet fill material to be drawn into the canvas voids—which
                  helps keep the tear in plane—and to take on the weave texture
                  of the canvas. A small, thin piece of Stabiltex impregnated
                  with Beva can be used to cover the mend both to act as a
                  moisture barrier for the repair and to add a second line of
                  security if the mend were ever to fail (<a href="#fig-30-10"><strong>fig. 30.10</strong></a>). <a href="#fig-30-11"><strong>Fig. 30.11</strong></a> shows
                  the difference at the tear site before and after treatment.

                <p>
                  Honoring the artist’s intent, understanding the forces that
                  hold paintings together and those that make them fall apart,
                  having a keen respect for the original materials and an
                  understanding of modern materials, reversibility, and
                  retreatability are the factors to hold in mind when caring for
                  damaged or changed paintings on canvas. Over the years it has
                  become clearer that our profession does not lend itself to a
                  one-size-fits-all approach, no matter how technically
                  sophisticated or well-engineered these materials or equipment
                  may be (the law of the instrument), and that the better we
                  understand the nature of the problem at hand, the more it can
                  lead us to simpler and more refined solutions (Occam’s razor).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those of us involved in structural canvas treatments are
                  constantly discovering better methods and tweaking what we do
                  to suit each painting we treat. For instance, since presenting
                  at the Conserving Canvas conference at Yale, Petra Demuth, who
                  teaches Heiber’s tear-mending techniques, has demonstrated
                  substitutions for the Trecker that are more nimble and far
                  easier to set up and use. It was an honor to be invited to
                  share my current techniques, but I continue to evolve and what
                  I do next year may be different from what I have done in the
                  past.

                  Structural damage to a canvas, such as tears, presents unique
                  problems when considering and conducting conservation
                  treatments and can be compounded when working in private
                  conservation, as a consistent and stable environment for the
                  exhibition, storage, and travel of a painting is not assured.
                  When Heiber’s thread-by-thread tear-mending technique is
                  selected as the preferred treatment method, further treatment
                  steps, such as reinforcements to the mend, are often necessary
                  to maintain integrity and planarity and ensure a successful
                  outcome. This paper argues for the necessity for
                  reinforcements to be added to tears repaired with Heiber’s
                  technique. Four case studies of tears encountered in a private
                  painting conservation setting are presented. These case
                  studies present examples in which structural reinforcements of
                  tear repairs were implemented, informed by the canvas’s
                  material properties; the type of damage to the canvas threads;
                  and the size, direction, and location of the tear. The
                  reinforcements discussed focus on the incorporation of
                  Gore-Tex sutures into the weave matrix.

                <p>
                  In the field of painting conservation, there are
                  long-established treatment techniques for addressing
                  structural repairs, such as tears in the canvas support. These
                  techniques range from more invasive treatments, such as
                  linings ([[Bailey 2017]]; [[Berger 1974]]; [[Berger 1975]];
                  [[Bernstein 1974]]; [[Fieux 1974]]; {:Goist 1977]]; [[Levenson
                  1974]]; [[Slabczynski 1960]]; [[Stoner 1994]]; [[Wales 1968]])
                  to less invasive treatments, such as patches and localized
                  thread-by-thread repairs ([[Barnett 1992]]; [[Bustin 2003]];
                  [[Heiber 2003]]; [[Piotrowska and Amann 2009]]; [[Proctor
                  1994]]). After the 1974 Greenwich conference ([[Villers
                  2003b]]), there was a shift in thought away from invasive
                  techniques and an effort to devise less-invasive techniques
                  ([[Hackney 2004a]]; [[Keck 1977]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The development of the thread-by-thread tear mending
                  technique, published by Winfried Heiber ([[Heiber 2003]];
                  [[Proctor 1994]]), enabled a new phase of less-invasive
                  treatments of structural repairs in painting conservation,
                  which were more sympathetic to the canvas, did not alter the
                  surface appearance of a painting, recreated the aesthetic
                  properties of the canvas, and were reversible. Heiber’s
                  technique involves the retwining of the torn and splayed
                  threads and then reintegrating them into the weave matrix to
                  reestablish the overall tension of the canvas in the torn and
                  damaged area. It is well established that a fluctuating
                  environment causes the canvas fibers to swell and contract
                  ([[Cornelius 1967]]), placing stress on the canvas, paint
                  layers, and any structural damage and repairs ([[Berger and
                  Russell 1990]]). The theory behind Heiber’s repairs is that
                  when individual fibers are reconnected, the integrity of the
                  canvas is restored, and the whole canvas responds uniformly to
                  environmental fluctuations; this in turn reduces localized
                  stress on the mend.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The success of a Heiber mend is dependent on factors such as
                  the type of damage to the canvas threads, as well as the size,
                  direction, and location of the tear. The two most common
                  categories of damage to the threads are tearing from the
                  canvas weave and cuts, and the associated bonds for each
                  affect the ability of the mend to withstand stresses. Tears
                  involving torn threads can be reconnected by overlapping and
                  intermingling fibers from opposing threads, and then adhering
                  them with a small amount of adhesive. This type of join
                  creates the strongest bond, and it can withstand greater
                  amounts of stress. Tears where the threads have been cut are
                  reconnected to the opposing thread with a butt join and a
                  small amount of locally applied adhesive. This type of join
                  relies mostly on the strength of the adhesive, rather than the
                  combination of the canvas fibers and adhesive; it is less
                  successful when placed under stress and less able to maintain
                  planarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The size or length of the tear impacts the overall structural
                  integrity of the canvas support. Horizontal and vertical tears
                  are both affected by stress inherent to the overall canvas,
                  but horizontal tears are vulnerable to the added effects of
                  gravity and the weight of the canvas pulling on the mend. This
                  stress is increased when the tension of the canvas is loose
                  and there is a thick, heavy paint layer. Lastly, the location
                  of the tear and potential stress from increased vibrations may
                  compound the stress created by all the other factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For all of these reasons, it is important to build on Heiber’s
                  theories and develop additional localized treatment strategies
                  that can be used to strengthen tear mends while being
                  sympathetic to the canvas support. Verso reinforcements are an
                  important last step to a tear repair when the bonds in the
                  repair are not strong enough to withstand stress from
                  environmental fluctuations, which can be exacerbated by the
                  damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This paper uses four case studies undertaken at Amann +
                  Estabrook Conservation Associates to describe the option of
                  verso reinforcements as a way to bridge and support
                  thread-by-thread mends. The process of deciding whether verso
                  reinforcement is necessary, and if so, what materials may be
                  appropriate, is discussed in each case.

                  At Amann + Estabrook, Gore-Tex sutures<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  sewn into the weave matrix have been found to provide a
                  passive, inert, and flexible support network that helps
                  counter mechanical forces ([[Hartman 2017]]; [[Piotrowska and
                  Amann 2009]]). They are fully reversible and can be removed
                  easily if required. The sutures also lend themselves to
                  variations and can be adapted to suit each individual case.
                  They can be varied in length, concentration, and sewing
                  methods, thereby reducing the potential for telegraphing
                  through to the face.

                <p>
                  Gore-Tex sutures, commonly used in dental surgery, are a
                  microporous, flexible polytetrafluoroethylene monofilament
                  with a stainless-steel needle fused to either end of the
                  monofilament. They are soft and easy to manipulate. They can
                  also be dyed to match the fabric support of a painting, and
                  thus be a discreet addition to a conservation treatment. They
                  come in a variety of monofilament thicknesses, needle gauges,
                  and needle types. Generally, the preferred Gore-Tex suture for
                  most treatments where suture reinforcements are needed is the
                  thinnest gauge: monofilament CV-8 with a needle gauge of TTc-7
                  and a taper needle shape.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gore-Tex sutures may not be suitable for every painting. For
                  sutures to be successfully integrated into the canvas weave,
                  they need to be sewn between overlapping warp and weft
                  threads. The canvas fibers need to be supple enough to allow
                  the needle and suture to pass through. If the canvas has
                  deteriorated and become brittle, sutures can shatter the
                  canvas fibers within the threads. For this reason, Gore-Tex
                  sutures are more suited to modern and contemporary paintings,
                  because they have less deterioration than considerably more
                  aged canvases. However, each canvas must be assessed on an
                  individual basis. In some cases, when deterioration of the
                  canvas is not uniform, Gore-Tex sutures can be used in
                  combination with other methods to bridge tears. Other verso
                  reinforcements used in combination are Japanese paper
                  “sutures” and patches infused with Beva 371.

                  The first painting presented is by a Japanese artist and was
                  painted in the mid-1970s. The painting measures 120 x 77
                  inches (304.8 x 195.6 cm) and is one of two from a diptych.
                  The painting was executed on a plain-weave, medium-weight
                  cotton duck canvas that was stretched onto a sturdy
                  seven-member wood expansion-bolt stretcher. The stratified
                  structure of the paint layer consists of a thin, evenly
                  applied white ground layer followed by layers of sparsely
                  applied acrylic paint, graphite, and art markers.

                  The painting had a 5 1/2 inch vertical tear located in the
                  bottom left corner, 1 inch from the left turning edge. Four
                  vertical-running threads were severed and hung loosely, while
                  several other vertical threads, although intact, were
                  stretched and pulled out of the weave matrix. The horizontal
                  threads were torn the length of the tear and had splayed ends.
                  The torn ends appeared to meet their opposing threads, which
                  indicated that a gap between the edges of the tear had not
                  developed. The canvas had rippled distortions that ran down
                  both edges of the tear. Fractured paint radiated from the
                  tear, with associated lifting and loss to the paint and ground
                  layers. Paint fragments were also attached to the hanging
                  vertical threads.

                  The tear’s size, direction, location, and type within the
                  overall painting are fundamental when determining the damage
                  to the overall structural integrity of the canvas support
                  caused by the tear. Once assessed, this helps determine how to
                  proceed with conservation treatment. In this case, the tear
                  was 5 1/2 inches long (13.9&nbsp;cm), ran vertically, and was 23
                  3/4 to 28 5/8inches (60.3–72.7&nbsp;cm) from the lower edge and
                  1&nbsp;inch (2.5&nbsp;cm) from the left turning edge. Lastly, the
                  threads in the tear were torn rather than cut bluntly. The
                  length of the tear was relatively small in proportion to the
                  overall height of the painting—only 5%.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Under observation while in the studio, the tear did not
                  increase in size or form distortions within the support. From
                  this, it was determined that the overall impact of the tear on
                  the integrity of the canvas was minimal. As the tear ran
                  vertically, it was estimated that the tear did not bear
                  significant weight from the canvas and was not greatly
                  affected by gravity. The location of the tear, close to the
                  left turning edge and approximately 25 inches from the lower
                  edge, was predicted to be under a low amount of strain—an
                  estimate which was again supported by the lack of distortions
                  in area ([[Berger and Russell 1988]]). Lastly, threads within
                  the tear were torn and pulled out of the weave, which meant
                  that, when rewoven, opposing threads would overlap and create
                  a strong repair. As the tear’s size, direction, and location
                  had minimal impact on the overall integrity of the canvas,
                  additional verso reinforcements to the tear were not
                  necessary; the treatment was more aesthetic than structural.
                  This minimal approach provided the flexibility to potentially
                  add reinforcements in the future should it be necessary.

                  The painting was treated in situ while the fabric remained
                  attached to the stretcher. The canvas was mended using the
                  Heiber thread-by-thread repair method, working only from the
                  face under stereo magnification. as the reverse was not
                  available due to its being behind the stretcher bar. Broken
                  and frayed threads were retwisted and sized with a dilute
                  solution of methylcellulose in distilled water. The dampened
                  threads were then rewoven into the weave matrix to
                  aesthetically match the original weave. The adjoining threads
                  were connected and adhered with a bead of dilute Vinamul 3252

                  The second painting presented was completed in the late 1960s
                  by an artist prominent in the Abstract Expressionist movement.
                  The painting measures 92 1/2 x 128 inches (235 x 325&nbsp;cm) and
                  was executed on a heavyweight cotton duck canvas that was
                  stretched onto a sturdy wooden stretcher. The ground layer is
                  an evenly applied white layer, and the paint layer, estimated
                  to be oil, was applied in limited areas within the top half of
                  the painting in a thin brush application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The face of the painting was accidentally slashed with a
                  boxcutter when the work was being unpacked, which left a
                  slightly wavering, horizontal, sharply cut tear through the
                  fabric support (<a href="#fig-31-1"><strong>fig. 31.1</strong></a>). The tear was located 48 1/16 to 48 3/4 inches
                  (122–123.8&nbsp;cm) from the upper edge and 3 3/8 to 17 5/8 inches
                  (8.6–44.8&nbsp;cm) from the right edge. The tear exhibits minute
                  loss of the thin ground layer. There was some fraying of the
                  exposed threads, and the opposing threads along the edge of
                  the tear were not aligned. The edges of the tear tented
                  forward, were slightly distorted, and gaped. Lastly, the
                  overall tension of the canvas was loose.

                <p>
                  Here again, the size, direction, location, and type of the
                  tear all were major factors that influenced the treatment
                  steps and consideration of verso reinforcements. The size of
                  the tear was 13.5 inches (34.3&nbsp;cm), which was 11% of the
                  overall length of the edge of the painting. Because of this
                  length, combined with the horizontal direction of the tear and
                  its central location, it was estimated that there would be
                  significant stress placed on the tear mend from the weight of
                  the canvas. Another factor to consider in this case was the
                  type of tear: a blunt cut, which meant no “reweaving” of the
                  canvas would be possible due to the lack of overlapping
                  threads. Mends for this type of tear mostly rely on the
                  adhesive to bridge the tear, which makes them, generally, very
                  weak mends ([[Flock et al. 2020]]). With these combined
                  factors and the inherent flexibility of the canvas, it was
                  determined that verso reinforcements of Gore-Tex sutures woven
                  into the canvas weave were necessary to bridge the mend and
                  create a lasting repair.

                  The tear mend proceeded with a Heiber thread-by-thread repair.
                  To facilitate this, the painting was placed face down on a
                  table. To access the end of the tear, which continued under
                  the stretcher bar, a small section of the stretcher member
                  measuring 3/4&nbsp;x 3 5/8 inches (1.9 x 3.6 cm) was routed out
                  (this was a less invasive approach than removing a section of
                  the stretcher or taking the painting off the stretcher
                  entirely). Two sets of RH Engineering Trekkers<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  were mounted on the horizontal crossbars that ran parallel to
                  the tear. The Trekkers were used to reduce the gap and bridge
                  the tear by pulling the edges together using lateral tension.
                  When aligned, the corresponding abutted threads were connected
                  with a minute bead of an adhesive solution, 25% sturgeon glue
                  in distilled water combined with Solka-Floc 10 Cellulose
                  powder at a 20:1 v/v ratio. The adhesive was then heat-set
                  using a heated needle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the tear mend progressed under tension provided by the
                  Trekkers, Gore-Tex sutures were sewn across the tear in a
                  perpendicular direction to bridge the mend, reinforcing the
                  torn weft threads. The suture thread was initially anchored by
                  looping twice around a warp thread approximately 1&nbsp;1/2 to 2
                  inches from the tear (<a href="#fig-31-2"><strong>fig. 31.2</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The suture then jumped over three to six threads and was
                  threaded under the next horizontal warp thread (<a href="#fig-31-3"><strong>fig. 31.3</strong></a>). This continued until the suture had bridged the tear, and
                  it was anchored again on the opposite side. Importantly, the
                  length of each bridging thread and the distance between each
                  threaded warp thread was staggered so as not to form a visible
                  pattern. In this case, the length varied from 4 to 6 inches
                  across the tear and three to six canvas threads between each
                  bridging suture. It was theorized that this should prevent any
                  ridges, lines, and/or patchlike forms from telegraphing
                  through to the face of the painting.

                  The third example was painted in the mid-1980s by a
                  well-established contemporary European artist who works across
                  mediums and uses an array of materials. The large-scale
                  painting, measuring 84 x 150&nbsp;inches (216 × 381&nbsp;cm), was
                  executed on a heavy-duty, coarse, densely woven linen. The
                  auxiliary support was an underbuilt, seven-member wooden
                  strainer with one horizontal and two vertical crossbars. The
                  paint and ground layers consisted of textured multimedia
                  layers ranging between 1/2 to 1&nbsp;inch thick (1.3–2.5&nbsp;cm);
                  consequently, the painting is incredibly heavy. The ground was
                  initially applied in a heavy impasto layer, followed by
                  subsequent thinner layers of paint added in various manners,
                  including drips, splashes, and by brush. The ground and paint
                  layers had a characteristic drying-crack pattern that
                  developed due to the artist’s process.

                  The work was damaged during transport, causing the center
                  crossbar to break and tear through the face of the painting
                  (<a href="#fig-31-4"><strong>fig. 31.4</strong></a>). This resulted in two horizontal tears measuring 43&nbsp;inches
                  (109&nbsp;cm) and 5&nbsp;inches (12.7&nbsp;cm) in the canvas support, located
                  left of the center. There was significant paint loss around
                  the tear; fortunately, the paint fragments were saved and
                  later collected from within the travel frame. The canvas was
                  very loose when it came to the studio, forming a belly along
                  the lower edge. In addition, there were distortions
                  surrounding the edges of the tear.

                  The damage to the canvas support in this case study was
                  significant. This combination of the size, direction,
                  location, and type of tear impacted the structural integrity
                  of the canvas and justified the treatment steps, which
                  included the addition of reinforcements to the reverse. The
                  larger, 43-inch tear ran horizontally and was located slightly
                  left of the painting’s center; the warp and weft threads had
                  been torn and stretched from within the weave matrix. The
                  length of the tear was significant, at 29% of the width of the
                  painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was estimated that due to the length and position of the
                  tear, the area of damage was under significant mechanical
                  stress from the weight of the paint layer and canvas. The
                  heaviness of the paint layer added an extra level of
                  complexity and potential fragility to the repair. The fact
                  that the torn threads were available to be overlapped and
                  reintegrated into the fabric structure, allowing for a strong
                  mend, was the only reason a localized treatment could be
                  considered in such an extreme case. In context, it was
                  determined that verso reinforcements were necessary for a
                  successful treatment, and the characteristics of the
                  relatively new canvas would allow this to be done.

                  The intention of the treatment was to reestablish the
                  structural integrity of the canvas matrix and to ensure the
                  longevity of the mend. This treatment was conducted in two
                  stages: the structural features of the treatment, which
                  required the painting to lie horizontally and face up, and the
                  second stage of aesthetic treatment, which required it to be
                  positioned vertically. Due to the scope of this paper, only
                  the tear mending and reinforcement procedures of this
                  treatment are discussed here.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The treatment advanced with a Heiber thread-by-thread tear
                  mend. Due to the size of the painting and the location of the
                  tear, work was not able to progress under magnification.
                  Fortunately, the canvas weave was coarse and magnification was
                  not vital for the treatment. Before reweaving could commence,
                  all the broken threads were groomed, as they unfurled readily
                  when manipulated, becoming too thick and unruly to
                  sufficiently interlock within the weave matrix. To improve
                  their malleability, the threads were sized with a weak
                  solution of isinglass with an addition of Vinamul 3252 and
                  then retwisted with tweezers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The threads were then rewoven, connecting the overlapping and
                  intertwining weft threads with a bead of dilute Vinamul 3252,
                  and secured with a heated, needle-tipped microspatula. Broken
                  weft threads that did not meet their opposing thread were
                  extended with a small section of thread harvested from the
                  edge of the tacking margin. The harvested threads were groomed
                  with the same isinglass-Vinamul solution, and then intertwined
                  with the torn weft threads and connected to opposing threads
                  within the tear. The repair work progressed from both the face
                  and reverse.

                  As sections were completed, Gore-Tex suture reinforcements
                  were interwoven into the back of the weave matrix to bridge
                  the tear (<a href="#fig-31-5"><strong>fig. 31.5</strong></a>). Gore-Tex monofilament size CV-5 was selected as the most
                  appropriate suture due to its size, flexibility, and strength.
                  Before being woven into the canvas the Gore-Tex threads were
                  tinted to match the tone of the canvas using Orasol dyes
                  dissolved in ethanol. Locking forceps were used to handle the
                  needle, and starting approximately 2 inches before the
                  beginning of the tear, the sutures were threaded into the
                  canvas following the weave pattern of the weft threads, which
                  ran perpendicular to the direction of the tear. The ends were
                  anchored and looped in the same fashion as described in case
                  study 2 (see <a href="#fig-31-2"><strong>fig. 31.2</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sutures were introduced every third, fourth, and fifth
                  weft thread, and they were all staggered in length. It was
                  determined that the sutures would be threaded under every warp
                  thread. Firstly, this was because the canvas weave was so
                  large the sutures could easily pass through without disrupting
                  the bond between the ground layer and the canvas. Secondly,
                  the closer and more aligned to the weft thread the sutures
                  were, the more sympathetic the support from the reinforcements
                  would be to the canvas weave structure, ultimately creating a
                  stronger and more stable bridge.

                  The final case study is a circular painting measuring 7 feet
                  in diameter, completed by an American abstract artist in the
                  early 1950s. The support is a moderate-weight, plain-weave
                  cotton duck canvas. The canvas is unprimed, and the paint
                  layer consists of intermittently brushed and poured oil paint
                  in various consistencies. The major damage, located at the
                  center-bottom, was a 13&nbsp;1/2 inch (34.3&nbsp;cm) tear in a roughly C
                  shape with right angles and with a section running along the
                  turning edge (<a href="#fig-31-6"><strong>fig. 31.6</strong></a>). Numerous threads had been torn and pulled out of the weave
                  matrix in both the warp and the weft directions. The loose
                  flap of the support within the torn region had developed a
                  mild crease from hanging in the folded position. The severed
                  and pulled threads within the tear appeared to line up and
                  meet their adjacent threads. Due to the lack of a priming
                  layer and aging, the oil medium from the paint layer appeared
                  to have leached into the unprimed canvas, embrittling and
                  undermining the fabric. The overall tension of the canvas was
                  also very loose.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting had been previously treated before the tear
                  occurred, and the turning edge was strip-lined with muslin
                  adhered with a Beva-like material. When the strip-lining was
                  removed to fully access the tear, the revealed canvas was
                  particularly degraded, discolored, and very brittle, possibly
                  as a result of either the strip-lining adhesive or the
                  application process. The painting also had a loose-lining,
                  which was not torn at the time that it was damaged.

                <p>
                  This last case study presented another unique challenge in
                  that each of the three sections of the C-shaped tear had
                  different properties that needed to be considered when
                  determining the suitability for verso reinforcements. Each
                  direction of the tear was evaluated individually to assess the
                  impact of the direction on the tear and the painting as a
                  whole. This resulted in a variety of reinforcements that were
                  unique to each problem. For clarity, I will discuss each
                  section of the tear separately: section A represents the top,
                  horizontal tear; section B, the vertical section; and section
                  C, the lower horizontal section along the turning edge of the
                  painting (see <a href="#fig-31-6"><strong>fig. 31.6</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Section A was a straightforward assessment. Because the
                  threads had been torn out of the weave matrix, the tear was
                  able to be repaired by overlapping the threads, creating a
                  mend that would be strong enough to mitigate the stresses
                  placed on it by the size and direction of the tear. Section B
                  was initially thought to be similar to section A, but as the
                  mend progressed, it became apparent that the overlapping
                  threads were not bridging the tear effectively. The area where
                  the two sections intersected was also very weak and pulled
                  open when stretched. This indicated that section B required
                  further reinforcements to aid the stretching of the canvas in
                  order to complete the treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When assessing section C, the location and the past
                  conservation treatment of this section were the determining
                  factors for this part of the mend. First, the canvas fibers
                  were in a very brittle state that was difficult to work with,
                  as they fractured and shattered when manipulated. This meant
                  that creating a strong bond from overlapping threads was not
                  possible. This section was also the most vulnerable area of
                  the tear because of the mechanical stress placed on it when
                  the painting was stretched. Ideally, sutures would have been
                  considered, but the brittle threads could not withstand even
                  the mild stress of the threading process.

                <p>
                  Before Heiber’s thread-by-thread tear mending technique could
                  be applied, torn threads were groomed, organized, and sized
                  with dilute methylcellulose. Once the threads were organized,
                  the broken threads were rewoven back into the weave matrix and
                  adjoining threads were secured with a small bead of dilute
                  Vinamul 3252. New cotton threads of a similar weight and tone
                  to the original threads were added when adjoining threads were
                  not long enough to reconnect or when a secure bond could not
                  be created. To aid with the manipulation of the cotton threads
                  and limit shattering of original fibers, the new threads were
                  lightly moistened with distilled water, which enabled them to
                  be maneuvered into the matrix with relative ease.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once the mend had been completed, verso reinforcements could
                  be added to appropriate areas (<a href="#fig-31-7"><strong>fig. 31.7</strong></a>). Staggered and irregular lengths of Gore-Tex sutures were
                  threaded through the weave, running perpendicular to section B
                  of the tear. Areas of canvas with paint on the surface were
                  avoided because the fabric was too brittle and degraded for
                  the sutures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To support areas where the Gore-Tex sutures could not be
                  integrated into the weave, Japanese paper “sutures” were used
                  as an alternative. These sutures, approximately 1/32 inch
                  (0.8&nbsp;mm) in width and varied in length, were infused with
                  liquid Beva 371 and minimally heat-set to the back of the
                  canvas where sections A and B of the tear intersected,
                  perpendicular to section B.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Section C of the tear was reinforced on the reverse with a
                  patch of Japanese paper, the edges of which were softened by
                  tearing and by splaying individual paper fibers. The patch was
                  infused with Beva 371, lightly coating the individual paper
                  fibers at the edges. Finally, it was secured using a warm
                  tacking iron.

                <p>
                  The purpose of this paper has been to introduce new methods
                  that help bridge thread-by-thread tear mends and enhance
                  Heiber’s method. Specifically, these methods, conducted from
                  the reverse, create a sympathetic bridge across a
                  thread-by-thread tear mend, using Gore-Tex sutures woven into
                  the weave matrix. These treatments were described through four
                  case studies, each case study demonstrating a particular
                  application of the Gore-Tex sutures and how their application
                  is influenced by the specific nature of the painting and the
                  type of damage. The treatments ranged from a tear mend of a
                  butt join with Gore-Tex suture verso reinforcement to a tear
                  mend with Gore-Tex suture verso reinforcement of an oversized
                  painting to a tear mend with a combination of verso
                  reinforcements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As demonstrated in the case studies, the Gore-Tex sutures can
                  be altered to suit the specific painting and canvas to achieve
                  the most successful results. However, they are not always
                  needed, as demonstrated in the first case study, and it is
                  important to assess the need for verso reinforcements in
                  individual situations, as every painting is different; thus it
                  is important to take into consideration the characteristics of
                  the painting. Sutures are one option available to the
                  conservator, an important tool in the toolbox of conservation.

                  Today the collection of the Neue Pinakothek in Munich
                  comprises a collection inaugurated by King Ludwig II of
                  Bavaria in 1853, which has continued to grow, while the
                  Collection Schack, a collection of over 250 paintings bought
                  directly from the artist in the second half of the nineteenth
                  century, has remained intact. The collection of the Neue
                  Pinakothek has received more interactive treatment in line
                  with the developing approaches to conservation in the
                  twentieth century, while the Schack collection has received
                  minimal treatment, with a large proportion remaining
                  relatively untouched. In response to today’s more minimal
                  approach to conservation treatments and with increasing
                  emphasis on preventive care, the digitization of the
                  institution’s conservation records afforded the opportunity to
                  assess the effects of various treatments over time. Sufficient
                  data was provided for an analysis of over 1,700 paintings as
                  well as the overview of a conservator who has worked with the
                  collections for over twenty-five years.

                <p>
                  Publications offer us only a fragmentary understanding of
                  developments in conservation. One such fragment is the plea to
                  “do in future only that which is absolutely necessary, and if
                  in doubt, do nothing at all—always heeding the fact that each
                  intervention is in and of itself irreversible” ([[Weddigen
                  1980|, 30]]). This statement represents a shift witnessed in
                  the field of paintings conservation in German-speaking
                  countries around 1980.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  This new approach called into question the suitability of
                  lining canvas paintings as the default method for treating
                  many types of defects. As a result, lining was indeed largely
                  replaced by less invasive alternatives in the following years.
                  Retaining an artwork’s “untouched” condition, thus enabling
                  later generations to uncover clues whose significance may not
                  yet be understood, gained importance as a value in its own
                  right.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Around the same time, an occupational profile was developed
                  for conservation-restoration that defined academic training as
                  a future standard. Considering the treatment of canvas
                  paintings, this change took place over years and—depending on
                  the country—at different times, influenced by leading
                  conservators and university teaching. Nowadays, more than a
                  generation of German-speaking conservators see lining as an
                  almost exclusively historical technique that is only taught to
                  elucidate its various methods.

                  At the 1974 international Conference on Comparative Lining
                  Techniques in Greenwich, lining was not yet challenged per se;
                  the focus was on improving materials and methods. While the
                  exchange of ideas across language borders was still quite
                  limited at this time,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>the impact of this conference is nevertheless visible in some
                  German publications published thereafter.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  By the annual meeting of the Deutscher Restauratorenverband
                  (German Association of Conservators-Restorers) in 1980,
                  however, lining was fundamentally questioned and alternatives
                  sought ([[von Manteuffel-Szoege 1980]]). Here, probably for
                  the first time in such an arena, thread-by-thread tear mending
                  was presented ([[Gabler 1979]]). In Switzerland, too,
                  criticism was being leveled at traditional lining techniques
                  under the caption “Gaining experience through failure”
                  ([[Weddigen 1981]]). Occasional discussions of improved lining
                  methods followed,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  but from the 1990s onward it was all about tear mending with
                  adhesives, and later stitching (see, for example, [[Heiber
                  1996]] and [[Beltinger 1992]]). In this context,
                  retrospectives published in 1983 on the history of lining,
                  marouflage, and paintings transfer assume an almost epitaphic
                  quality ({Marty 1983}; [[Schaible 1983a]]; [[Schaible 1983b]];
                  [[Schiessl 1983]]).

                  At a conservation conference in 1984, Winfried Heiber used a
                  microscope linked to a projection screen to give a live
                  demonstration of thread-by-thread tear mending.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  In his comprehensive description of the method published in
                  1996, Heiber noted in amazement that “an idea can quietly
                  assert itself—with little to no publication, very modest
                  practical instruction on the part of the protagonists, no
                  indoctrination attempts and no divisive fundamental
                  discussions” ([[Heiber 1996|, 117]]).

                  As the author began her conservation career at the time of
                  this turning point, the minimal-intervention approach was
                  natural to her from early on. Reviewing countless paintings
                  that were ‘overrestored’ (from today’s perspective) across
                  centuries was a painful experience. This made the discovery
                  that Munich’s two nineteenth-century state painting
                  collections—the Neue Pinakothek and the Sammlung Schack (for
                  whose conservation the author is responsible)—seem to contain
                  an unusually large number of paintings in a fairly original
                  state of preservation all the more inspiring. This study was
                  conducted in order to support this empirical observation and
                  to better understand and provide access to the restoration
                  history of the collections. It is limited to a summary record
                  of the treatments carried out on the canvas paintings, as far
                  as these are documented, and their placement within the
                  temporal context. Verification of the data or specific
                  follow-up examinations of individual paintings was not
                  possible within the scope of the project.

                  The restoration history of a work depends on the specifics of
                  how it was made as well as its provenance and history. Use and
                  whereabouts determine its aging process, while the particular
                  expectations of various owners and the professional
                  convictions of conservators have a bearing on treatments
                  undertaken. Thus, we begin with the history of the collections
                  considered in this study.

                  The Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen (Bavarian State
                  Paintings Collections) houses Bavarian art holdings dating
                  from the fourteenth century to the present day. Currently, the
                  collection is divided across seventeen museums, with the
                  Doerner Institut responsible for conservation. Of the five
                  galleries located in Munich, two specialize in
                  nineteenth-century artworks: the Neue Pinakothek and the
                  Sammlung Schack. The two galleries have much in common, but
                  also differ in significant ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Neue Pinakothek was founded in 1853 by Ludwig I
                  (1786–1868). The former king of Bavaria was passionate about
                  art. During his reign (1825–1848) he developed the state
                  capital of Munich into a cultural gem. He had numerous
                  monumental structures erected, including the Glyptothek and
                  Alte Pinakothek, museums built to house the royal collections
                  of antique sculptures and old master paintings. Ludwig I also
                  supported the arts by amassing a collection of paintings and
                  sculptures by artists of his time. His Neue Pinakothek was one
                  of the very first museums ever to be dedicated exclusively to
                  contemporary art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Sammlung Schack is also a private collection, founded by
                  Count Adolf Friedrich von Schack (1815–1894), a wealthy,
                  well-traveled poet and historian of art and literature. When
                  he settled in Munich in 1855, the vibrant local art scene
                  inspired him to begin building up a collection of contemporary
                  art. Schack had his own ideas regarding suitable themes, and
                  he commissioned local artists to create paintings for him in
                  keeping with his artistic and literary ideals. In addition, he
                  also commissioned young artists to create eighty-four
                  full-size copies, predominantly of Venetian Renaissance
                  paintings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The two museums have in common that they were founded as
                  private collections; however, while Schack’s collection has
                  remained an almost unaltered ensemble, the Neue Pinakothek
                  continued to expand after Ludwig’s death (<a href="#fig-32-1"><strong>fig. 32.1</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Sammlung Schack comprises 267 paintings, mostly painted
                  over the course of about twenty-five years, in the 1860s and
                  1870s. After Schack’s death, the collection became public
                  property, and it has been part of the Bayerische
                  Staatsgemäldesammlungen since 1939.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By contrast, the Neue Pinakothek’s collection consists of over
                  3,300 paintings in addition to various sculptures,
                  photographs, and graphic art. The works date from a period
                  spanning some two hundred years, from the mid-eighteenth to
                  the mid-twentieth century, that is, well beyond the nineteenth
                  century. From the last quarter of the nineteenth century
                  onwards, Ludwig I’s collection was increasingly expanded using
                  state funds. Artists’ estates were accepted and new artifacts
                  purchased, in particular from major Munich art exhibitions.
                  While the initial focus of the acquisitions was on local
                  artists, it gradually became more international. A significant
                  enhancement was the acquisition of recent French art, which
                  began in 1909. With the Second World War came the destruction
                  of the museum building, marking a turning point in the
                  collection’s history. For the opening of the new building in
                  1981, the museum once again strengthened its international
                  orientation by acquiring French, English, and Spanish
                  paintings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A decisive difference between the two collections is their
                  acquisition history. Schack acquired at least 70% of his works
                  more or less directly from the artists themselves, with about
                  90% of his paintings bought within ten years of being painted.
                  Their aging and restoration backgrounds are thus directly tied
                  to the history of the collection itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By contrast, only about a third of the paintings in the Neue
                  Pinakothek were acquired soon after they were painted, while
                  the rest entered the collection with individual histories
                  going back up to 200 years (<a href="#fig-32-2"><strong>fig. 32.2</strong></a>).

                  Conservation History of the Collections
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Initially, the paintings were still “young” and had little
                  need for conservation. Any necessary treatments were carried
                  out by Alte Pinakothek conservators (see also [[Wiesmann
                  2007]]). Some fifty years ago, with a growing number of museum
                  buildings and an increase in staff, the responsibility of
                  caring for certain collections was divided up among the
                  conservators—a structure that is still in place today. This
                  specialization reflects the altered professional profile of
                  the conservator, who no longer steps in only once intervention
                  is required but now also acts preventively by overseeing a
                  host of museum processes, including exhibitions and loans.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following the Second World War, the Doerner-Institut was
                  affiliated with the Staatsgemäldesammlungen. Two separate
                  restoration workshops then operated side by side until they
                  were united under the name Doerner-Institut in 1977.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  Reports of previous differences in working methods can be
                  simply summarized: The museum conservators tended to practice
                  more “considered” collection care, preferring to rely on
                  tradition and experience and thus taking a more cautious
                  approach to new developments. The conservators at the research
                  facility Doerner-Institut, on the other hand, were more open
                  to experimental approaches using new materials and methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A distinction between conservators specializing in treatments
                  carried out on painted surfaces versus those who work
                  exclusively on supports seems never to have been made, as is
                  usual at other institutions. However, it was not uncommon in
                  the past for work on wooden panels and linings to be passed to
                  the carpenters, even if such a division of labor is only
                  rarely traceable in the reports.

                  Today there are a dozen permanent positions at the Doerner
                  Institut for conservators specializing in paintings,

                      The museum database made it possible to sort the paintings
                      in this study and transfer their basic data into an Excel
                      spreadsheet with the following columns: inventory number,

                      For this purpose, the technical details of each painting
                      were systematically recorded, in most cases only by visual
                      assessment, and a brief description was noted in a form.
                      These questionnaires included questions on lining and
                      whether or not the canvas attachment was original, but not
                      about partial treatments of the support. Only core
                      information (e.g., “oil on canvas”) was entered into the

                      Conservation reports date back to the 1830s. Most of the
                      time, standardized forms were used that initially divided
                      the data only into “findings” and “work report.” 1972 saw
                      the introduction of multiple-choice forms that included
                      the option of adding notes. These comprised both a section
                      on technical findings (e.g., previous lining and lining
                      method), and a section for noting condition and current
                      conservation treatment. With the introduction of digital
                      word processing in the 1990s, the work of conservators was
                      increasingly documented in their own words and with
                      growing attention to detail.

                      When a museum database was initiated in 2002, data-entry
                      fields for technological findings, condition, and
                      treatments were included, although filling them out was
                      entirely optional. This tempted people to forgo entries on
                      the technical details of a work in straightforward
                      treatment cases.

                  As we know, conservation perspectives and methods change over
                  time. On the whole, it can be said that reports were often
                  filed with too little regard for whether they would be
                  comprehensible for later generations.

                  After processing the canvas paintings from both collections,

                  restoration history was entered into the spreadsheet both as

                  lining, type of lining, marouflage, loose-lining,
                  impregnation, strip-lining, tear mending, conservator, and
                  date of intervention. This made it possible to generate graphs

                <p>
                  Taken together, the two collections contain 2,475 canvas
                  paintings, which makes up 71% of the total number of paintings
                  (<a href="#fig-32-3"><strong>fig. 32.3a</strong></a>).
                </p>

                  Unfortunately, the existing records for these paintings turned
                  out to be less complete than hoped. Thirty percent of the
                  canvas paintings have no files or reports; for a further 27%
                  only technological information is available, whereas 43% have
                  at least one restoration report (<a href="#fig-32-3"><strong>fig. 32.3b</strong></a>). Many reports mention earlier interventions for which there
                  is no documentation, even though the work must have been
                  carried out while the piece was in the museum’s possession.
                  Apparently, despite the long tradition of documenting
                  conservation treatments and a simplified procedure using
                  forms, the obligation to record interventions was often not
                  met. Furthermore, information regarding measures undertaken
                  prior to the museum’s acquisition is almost always missing.
                  Consequently, the study had to be reduced to the 1,740 canvas
                  paintings (70%) for which evaluable reports are archived—a
                  selection that is nevertheless considered sufficient for the
                  evaluation carried out here.

                  The different measures considered in detail (<strong><a href="#fig-32-4">figs. 32.4</a></strong>
                  and <a href="#fig-32-5"><strong>32.5</strong></a>) are as follows:
                </p>

                    <p>
                      88 of the canvases are glued onto rigid supports, 15 of
                      them on wood and 73 on cardboard. Knowledge of the
                      collection indicates that the wooden supports were
                      attached as restoration measures. For the paintings
                      described as “canvas on cardboard”, the date of and reason
                      for the cardboard backing cannot be confirmed. Is it a
                      prefabricated, two-layered support or an unstretched
                      canvas—typical for oil sketches—which for various reasons
                      was subsequently glued onto cardboard?
                    </p>
                  </li>

                    <p>
                      409 of the paintings are lined. Of these, 242 were lined
                      using a paste, 30 using a wax-resin mixture, and in 137
                      cases, the method used was not documented.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                      It was probably mostly paste, as it was already a common
                      nineteenth-century method and thus not specifically
                      mentioned. Alternatives to traditional techniques that
                      appeared following the 1974 Greenwich conference such as
                      nap-bond cold lining or mist-lining, the use of fabrics
                      made of synthetic or glass fibers, or the use of newer
                      adhesives such as acrylic resins or Beva 371, were not in
                      evidence.

                    <p>
                      The lining information in the evaluated reports seems
                      highly reliable. However, data about the following
                      techniques does not appear to be statistically evaluable,
                      since it was not systematically recorded using forms but
                      derives solely from individual reports. (The figures
                      should still be shown here, however, as they at least
                      reveal overall trends.) For 33 paintings, we have
                      documentary evidence of strip lining; 5 paintings received
                      a loose-lining with a second canvas and 1 with paper (some
                      of these were possibly original reinforcements); 5
                      paintings were mounted onto plywood panels without
                      adhesive to help stabilize particularly thick layers of
                      paint or extensive damage to the canvas; and 18 of the
                      paintings were impregnated with wax.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      1,181 of the paintings are thought to be unlined.
                      Documentary analysis and experience shows that measures
                      may still have been carried out on the canvases. Even
                      before thread-by-thread tear mending established itself in
                      the 1980s, tears were often only mended locally, for
                      example by attaching patches of tow or fabric to the back.
                      Tacking-edge repairs can range from local tear
                      stabilization to restretching a painting after complete
                      strip-lining—without necessarily having been documented.

                  According to a subjective impression of the entire collection,
                  the above result—that approximately 70% of the 1,740
                  documented paintings have not yet been lined, marouflaged, or
                  impregnated—appears to be on the low side. The reason is that
                  the 735 canvas paintings (30% of the total number) without
                  documentation are predominantly pictures that have been kept
                  in storage for decades not exhibited. On the whole, if there
                  were no plans to show the paintings, they were not restored.

                  Despite the limited informative value of the data found, its
                  temporal distribution will be presented graphically (<a href="#fig-32-6"><strong>fig. 32.6</strong></a>), as it reveals certain trends. For two-thirds of the 1,740
                  verifiable treatments, we know the year of execution.
                  Considering the distribution along the time axis, we see a
                  gradual increase becoming more apparent from the 1970s
                  onwards. Knowing that interventions were not consistently
                  documented, this increase cannot be equated with an increase
                  in conservation measures. Rather, it shows the
                  professionalization of conservation, and that trend led to
                  more systematic documentation. The graph does not indicate the
                  scope of the measures either: minimal intervention is
                  represented in the same manner as extensive conservation work.
                  Taken separately:

                      None of the marouflages can be definitively dated. The
                      same applies to a large number of the linings; 60% of the
                      wax but only 19% of the paste linings can be classified by
                      date. The first documented wax lining took place in 1952,
                      with the first recorded use of a heating table in
                      1965.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                      The years leading up to the last documented wax
                      lining—carried out in 1976, shortly after the Greenwich
                      Conference—mark the heyday of this method. The fact that
                      this period coincides with a general increase in
                      documentation explains why the number of unreported cases
                      of wax linings is lower than that of paste linings. Paste
                      was also used to line paintings during and after the boom
                      in wax treatments, recorded for the last time in 1995.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                      The exact formulation of the adhesive or a description of
                      the working method is very rarely provided.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>

                      Around 1915 and again around 1930, there are several
                      references to canvases being impregnated with a wax
                      mixture called “Dutch mass.” This was an alternative to
                      the usual glue lining used to consolidate and flatten
                      paintings with intact fabrics and protect them against
                      moisture. From the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, when wax
                      lining and heating tables were in their prime, several
                      paintings were also impregnated with wax.

                      Strip lining has been documented since the 1920s,
                      sometimes only applied partially. Beva 371 has been the
                      preferred adhesive since 1975.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>

                      As mentioned earlier, localized methods for treating
                      canvas tears can be inferred only from individual
                      restoration reports. Knowledge of the collection indicates
                      that far more partial repairs to old tears have been
                      carried out than were ever documented. Perhaps local
                      treatments had to be somehow unusual to merit being
                      described in a report. In 1935, for instance, a
                      20-centimeter tear was repaired using only thin tissue
                      patches. Treating such a sizable tear without lining seems
                      to have been unique. It was not until the 1970s that tears
                      were regularly mended with adhesive or holes closed with
                      fabric inlays without the additional application of a
                      patch. For about ten years, Calaton CB<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                      was the adhesive of choice. It was replaced by a standard
                      white glue<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                      commonly used by joiners. An alternative was a
                      two-component epoxy resin adhesive<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
                      that was considered advantageous not least because of its
                      resistance to solvents used in subsequent work steps. By
                      the time of Heiber’s 1996 publication on thread-by-thread
                      tear mending, a mixture of sturgeon glue and wheat starch
                      paste had become the predominant adhesive in use.

                      For the first time in 1917, and occasionally thereafter,
                      we find reports specifically mentioning that a painting
                      had been left on its old strainer or stretcher, or that
                      these had been repaired. Again, this approach was probably
                      written down because it was unusual. Common practice was
                      to replace old stretchers when they were regarded as
                      insufficient, particularly in cases were the canvas had to
                      be taken off its stretcher anyway. As awareness grew of
                      how much information could be gleaned from various types
                      of stretchers, historical labels, and original canvas
                      attachments, stretchers stopped being replaced—around
                      1980. Remaining stretchers that no longer carried their
                      original painting but had not yet been discarded were
                      gathered together to form a collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>

                  Evaluation of the Results
                </h2>
                <p>
                  This study confirms the general development in German-speaking
                  countries outlined at the beginning of this paper: the move
                  away from the traditional and regular use of lining to almost
                  complete abandonment of the method. Evaluation of the
                  individual reports, however, also indicates that this was not
                  a linear process. Even if certain methods were preferred
                  during certain periods, there seem to have been no fixed
                  rules; instead, it seems that conservators were generally free
                  to make their own decisions. For example, certain names stand
                  out for taking a particularly considered and cautious
                  approach. It is also noticeable that, at the time of the
                  transition to minimal intervention, exemplary reports were
                  often written by younger colleagues, perhaps because they were
                  especially open to exploring new developments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contrast to the canvas paintings examined here, the
                  majority of those in the old masters collections have been
                  lined. Reasons for this may include their age and that
                  restoration was already required at a time when lining was
                  still the obvious choice. That being said, the works
                  considered here are now already up to 270 years old.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Which factors determine that a painting requires restoration:
                  the quality of the workmanship (some paintings are
                  surprisingly well preserved despite their great age), the
                  environmental conditions in which a collection is housed (only
                  over the last few decades has the potential for damage been
                  significantly reduced for paintings in the Neue Pinakothek and
                  Sammlung Schack, thanks to ongoing improvements), the extent
                  to which the works have been displayed (generally, disregarded
                  paintings were treated less often than those on permanent
                  display or that traveled regularly to exhibitions); the
                  availability of staff and funds, or other variables? A
                  decisive factor seems to be the expectations held by owners
                  and conservators regarding the condition and appearance of a
                  painting. These vary depending on the period in question and,
                  to this day, on location, as different schools of thought or
                  trends in conservation still coexist around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This conclusion is exemplified by some of the French and
                  British paintings acquired for the Neue Pinakothek. Of thirty
                  late nineteenth-century paintings by Courbet, Cézanne, Manet,
                  Monet, van Gogh, Gauguin, and others, two-thirds had already
                  been lined when they were acquired between 1909 and 1916, when
                  the paintings were only fifteen to fifty-five years old and
                  had barely any damage of the kind that, from today’s
                  perspective, would justify lining. This treatment must have
                  been regarded as some kind of improvement by the artists
                  themselves or by art dealers or collectors at the turn of the
                  century. By way of comparison, of fifty-seven artworks, mostly
                  by German painters, painted and acquired at exactly the same
                  time, less than a third have been lined to date.

                  In 1799, the Bavarian court bought its very first painting by
                  an English painter: <em>The Pointer</em>, by George Stubbs,
                  dated 1766. In 1929, the painting was removed from its
                  stretcher and pressed to reduce cupping, but it was not
                  lined—an early example of a conservative approach to
                  restoration. In contrast, almost all thirteen British
                  paintings dating from 1750 to 1850 that were purchased on the
                  art market from the 1960s to the 1980s had been lined
                  previously. For some, the lining seems to have been carried
                  out shortly before the museum acquired the painting; that is,
                  it was possibly done especially for the sale.

                  The Neue Pinakothek’s entire collection, including works from
                  the Sammlung Schack not currently on display, was examined by
                  conservators in 2018–2019 in preparation for the building to
                  be completely cleared for renovation. Many of the paintings
                  featured localized paint-layer delamination, poor attachment
                  of the canvas, or evidence of old tears—damage that often
                  appears to have occurred decades ago and has slowly worsened
                  under the storage conditions. Localized stabilization was all
                  that was needed to prepare the paintings for transport and
                  additional years of storage. Proof—if proof were needed—that
                  “only doing what is absolutely necessary” for a long period of
                  time has suited the paintings very well indeed.

                  It would be interesting to examine on a broader scale what
                  triggered the shift toward less invasive treatments. As far as
                  canvas paintings are concerned, it seems that the habit of
                  using heating tables to apply wax linings in the 1960s and
                  1970s may have been too much of a supposedly good thing. But
                  perhaps it was also the growing need to restore paintings of
                  the past hundred years featuring deliberate matte-gloss
                  variations and textured surfaces that opened conservators’
                  eyes to the limitations and “crudity” of applying a uniform
                  treatment that was customary for older paintings at the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A comparative look at developments beyond the world of
                  conservation also seems appealing. At around the same time,
                  awareness was growing of the fact that technical applications
                  never merely fulfil their intended objective but can also have
                  undesirable side effects. Examples include the emergence of
                  the ecological movement, or the development of technology
                  assessment as a field of research.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The appreciation for artworks that have remained relatively
                  untouched over time also seems to have grown outside the
                  conservation field, be it in the art trade or among museum
                  curators—even though this can restrict possible uses for the
                  paintings. A piece might, for example, be stable enough to be
                  exhibited without the need for conservation, while at the same
                  time being so fragile that lending it out is not advised.
                  Greater authenticity, however, also makes possible the
                  discovery of traces pertaining to the artwork’s creation and
                  history that are essential for understanding the piece in its
                  entirety.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  Added to which, the experience of viewing an artwork that
                  appears to be untouched is always uniquely special.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These two collections, maintained with a more “conservative”
                  approach to restoration, are presented in the hope of
                  inspiring others. In the knowledge that to this day
                  conservators’ opinions still differ concerning the best
                  approach, this study hopes to gain support for the author’s
                  own conviction that less is more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Minimal intervention demands that conservators control their
                  need to lay their hands on the object and limit the
                  perfectionist streak that most share (though that is a
                  laudable trait to have). Why? Because both can be more
                  dangerous for the artwork than the ravages of time. One should
                  always bear in mind that aging is a very slow process.

                  Great appreciation is due my teachers Winfried Heiber and Hans
                  Brammer, who in different ways pioneered a more cautious
                  approach to conservation. My predecessor Konrad Laudenbacher
                  is credited for the extent to which he valued and maintained
                  the high degree of original preservation of the two
                  collections. My thanks go to Veronika Poll-Frommel and Jan
                  Schmidt for reviewing the manuscript, and to Josephine Beney
                  for the translation.

                        Limiting the reference point to German-speaking
                        countries seems sensible, given how little exchange
                        there was between conservators across language borders
                        in the past. Of vital importance to developments in
                        conservation were conferences in Germany, Austria, and
                        Switzerland, as well as publications such as the
                        <em>Mitteilungen Deutscher Restauratorenverband</em>
                        (1980–1986),
                        <em>Mitteilungen des Österreichischen
                          Restauratorenverbands</em>
                        (since 1986), and magazines such as
                        <em>Maltechnik Restauro</em> (1972–1987),
                        <em>Restauro</em> (since 1988),
                        <em>Zeitschrift für Kunsttechnologie und
                          Konservierung</em>
                        (since 1987), and
                        <em>Beiträge zur Erhaltung von Kunst- und Kulturgut</em>
                        (since 2003). However, it must also be acknowledged
                        that, due to the political situation at the time, the
                        exchange between conservators in the German Democratic
                        Republic (GDR) and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)
                        was very limited until 1989. This report is written from
                        an FRG point of view.

                  This essay is a personal perspective of a collection the
                  author has studied and worked on over a period of twenty-five
                  years. It discusses the early conservation history of the
                  paintings collection at the V&amp;A, especially preventive
                  conservation, and the impact that has had in their good
                  preservation. The purpose of the collection—to provide
                  excellent examples to improve industrial design—explains the
                  varied nature of the roughly two thousand paintings, which
                  span two thousand years. There is a continuity of purpose: the
                  collection still provides inspiration for the creative
                  industries. How paintings are prioritized for treatment
                  relates largely to the museum’s public program. The paper
                  describes the recent treatment of a selection of canvas
                  paintings that gives an idea of the range of treatments and
                  materials as well as the difference in scale, from an oil
                  sketch by Constable to a theatre backdrop designed by Picasso.

                  The V&amp;A History and Collections
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Conserving canvas at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A)
                  started with its earliest acquisitions. Opened as the South
                  Kensington Museum (SKM) in 1857 and given its current name in
                  1899, the museum’s purpose was to improve British industrial
                  design by collecting excellent examples. Paintings and other
                  works were lent to art schools throughout Britain for students
                  to copy, an effort organized by the appropriately named
                  Circulation Department. Many paintings were acquired for their
                  suitability as models for copying, and the ensuing years
                  brought gifts and bequests of collections of paintings.
                  Education for a range of audiences is still a primary focus,
                  and the collection is valued as a source of inspiration for
                  those in the creative industries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This essay discusses setting priorities for treatment and will
                  show how early preventive conservation practices at the SKM
                  have had a profound effect on the condition of the paintings
                  collection. I will describe some recent treatments of a
                  variety of canvas paintings and end with thoughts on their
                  future conservation needs.

                  The paintings at the V&amp;A are quite varied. They number
                  around 2,000 works and span 2,000 years—from first-century
                  Roman fresco to contemporary paintings from India and
                  Southeast Asia. There are some remarkable German medieval
                  paintings, the fourteenth-century
                  <em>Apocalypse Triptych</em> from Hamburg by Master Bertram
                  (d. 1415),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  and a fifteenth-century oil on canvas from Cologne by the
                  Master of the St. Ursula Legend (<a href="#fig-33-1"><strong>fig. 33.1</strong></a>). Italian Renaissance works include panels by Carlo Crivelli
                  (ca. 1430–1495) and Sandro Botticelli (1444/45–1510). There
                  are seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Netherlandish
                  paintings and significant collections of nineteenth-century
                  Continental and British paintings, including ninety-two oil
                  sketches by John Constable (1776–1837). Among the
                  twentieth-century additions are a large collection of
                  theatrical cloths, including backdrops used by the Ballets
                  Russes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In recent years, paintings have been acquired that have a
                  particular relevance to some other part of the collection or
                  have been bought as a pair of objects; for example, portraits
                  together with the item of clothing or jewelry that the sitter
                  is wearing, such as the
                  <em>Portrait of Edward Curtis</em> (1750), by Marco Benefial
                  (1684–1764), (E.381-2019), together with Curtis’s splendid
                  brocaded taffeta waistcoat (T.22-2019).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Roughly three-quarters of the paintings in the collection are
                  on canvas. Paintings are displayed throughout the museum,
                  notably in the Medieval and Renaissance Galleries, Europe
                  1600–1815, and the British Galleries 1500–1900. The Paintings
                  Galleries were reopened in 2003 in a part of the museum that
                  was built to house the first gift by John Sheepshanks
                  (1787–1863) in 1857.

                  How Paintings Are Prioritized for Treatment
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Most of the work of the conservation department, roughly 90%,
                  is driven by the museum’s public program: gallery projects
                  (redesigning and refurbishing galleries), exhibitions,
                  displays, and loans to other institutions. We try each year to
                  devote at least 10% of our time to work on the core
                  collection, on objects that have been identified as needing
                  conservation, although there is no plan to display them. Many
                  sections, including Paintings, find this difficult to achieve.
                  With paintings that are requested for loan, we take a minimal
                  approach, to try to preserve resources for the museum’s own
                  longer-term projects. In 2019, sixty-seven paintings were
                  requested for loan. Most years, preparing paintings for loan
                  and the associated admin takes up a quarter of my time for
                  instance.

                  The rehousing of the V&amp;A’s reserve collection from
                  premises in West London to a new collections and research
                  center in East London, in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park at
                  Stratford, has been a major project for the last few years.
                  This planned move spurred the completion of a condition survey
                  of the reserve collection. From the survey we identified just
                  over two hundred paintings that would benefit from some
                  attention before the move. The main issues were flaking paint,
                  very slack canvases, paintings poorly fitted into frames, and
                  frames with no backboard. Remedial work to address these
                  problems was carried out between November 2018 and March 2020
                  with the help of two colleagues on contract and a technician
                  doing the reframing and backing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Without the deadline of the move, the work would not have had
                  the same priority. The paintings in the reserve collection,
                  over 1,500, are only a small part of the 250,000 objects that
                  will have to be moved out of the store. COVID-19 has caused
                  some delays to the move, the new collections and research
                  center is now due to open in 2024.

                  Early Preventive Conservation
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The first curator of paintings at the SKM, Richard Redgrave
                  (1804–1888), had a protocol for dealing with newly acquired
                  paintings that we would now describe as preventive
                  conservation ([[Costaras 2013]]). Redgrave’s acquisition
                  procedure involved cleaning the reverse of paintings, as well
                  as the front, and putting a backing on the frame. A few years
                  later, putting glass in the frames became a policy. During the
                  years that I have worked at the V&amp;A, a great many of the
                  paintings in the collection have passed through the studio,
                  and I have had the opportunity to observe their condition. It
                  is striking how many canvases are unlined. I noted, thanks to
                  helpful labels on the reverse, that the treatment of almost
                  all the paintings that were lined was carried out in the 1890s
                  or early 1900s by F. Haines &amp; Sons (more of Haines &amp;
                  Sons later). Redgrave described the state of the Sheepshanks
                  paintings on their acquisition in 1856:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    When in the spring of last year the pictures were given over
                    to the Department, the greater number had been left, during
                    the years they had been in Mr. Sheepshanks’ possession, in
                    the state in which they had been purchased direct from the
                    studios of the various artists or elsewhere…and all had
                    gradually accumulated dirt and discoloration on their
                    surface, and much dust behind the canvases (a source of
                    mischief too often neglected). ([[Committee of Council on
                    Education 1858|, 64]])
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Redgrave went on to describe the measures taken after the dirt
                  had been removed from front and back:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    In order to secure the picture on canvas from the injury
                    arising from the accumulation of dust behind them, they have
                    all been protected by painted canvas stretched over them, so
                    as to exclude both damp and dust.” ([[Committee of Council
                    on Education 1858|, 65]])
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The painted canvas backing has the appearance of imitation
                  leather, it was stretched over the reverse of the painting and
                  tacked to the back of the frame. Narrow wooden fillets were
                  pinned along the edges to improve the seal. An example of this
                  method can be seen on a painting by Johann Gottfried Steffan
                  (1815–1905), <em>The Torrent,</em> 1844/1848 (1545–1869), and
                  probably dates from 1869, the year it was acquired (<a href="#fig-33-2"><strong>fig. 33.2</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As mentioned earlier, paintings from the collection were
                  regularly sent to art schools around the country for students
                  to copy. The destinations were noted on labels on the reverse,
                  possibly stamped on arrival at the art school. One such label
                  on the reverse of <em>The Torrent</em> records that it went to
                  Northampton and Salford in 1913, and Truro in 1922. An
                  adjacent label contains an injunction not to hang the painting
                  in direct sunlight. The galleries at South Kensington were
                  carefully designed to ensure that the viewer was not disturbed
                  by reflections from the central roof light (skylight),
                  described as “glitter,” including those high up on the walls
                  in a dense double or triple hang (<a href="#fig-33-3"><strong>fig. 33.3</strong></a>) ([[Committee of Council on Education 1858|, 62]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the recent survey, we found twelve paintings that still had
                  these nineteenth-century painted canvas backings, including
                  two from the Sheepshanks gift in 1856, one of which is
                  <em>The Hermit,</em> ca.1841, by Charles Landseer (1799–1879)
                  (FA.105[O]). The canvas is in plane and appears sound; until
                  the painting is requested for display or loan or exhibits some
                  structural problem, there seems no pressing need to unframe
                  it.

                  Treatment History and Philosophy
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In the early twentieth century, the use of painted canvas
                  backing gave way to plywood; a thin three-ply was used. In the
                  mid-twentieth century, plywood was superseded by hardboard
                  (the same sort of material as Masonite), which we still use.
                  Since the 1990s, we have been lining the hardboard with
                  Melinex, due to anxiety over its acidity, but I wonder
                  whether, left exposed, the hardboard would be more useful as a
                  buffer against fluctuating relative humidity. An alternative,
                  such as acid-free card, was considered, but was too expensive
                  for the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the exception of a limited number of paintings for
                  redesigned galleries, our approach has been for minimal
                  intervention. It is perhaps an advantage of working in a
                  museum that we can take the risk of doing minimal treatments,
                  knowing that if they fail, we can always do something more. We
                  can afford to wait until the more interventive treatment is
                  absolutely necessary. Between the nineteenth-century
                  preventive conservation, which has given the collection an
                  extraordinary number of unlined paintings, and the
                  nineteenth-century glue-paste linings, in the twenty-five
                  years that I have been at the V&amp;A I have only come across
                  one painting that I felt needed lining: on top of weakened
                  canvas, the ground adhesion was poor over the whole surface.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have carried out many strip-linings, where the tacking edges
                  of the lining canvas were starting to fail. I have been so
                  impressed with the skill of the Victorian liners, F. Haines
                  &amp; Sons, who had premises very close to the museum, off
                  Thurloe Square.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  Haines &amp; Sons carried out various conservation treatments
                  on paintings for the museum, as well as lining, although their
                  treatment of canvas is the focus here. A painting by William
                  Redmore Bigg (1755–1828),
                  <em>A Cottage Interior: An Old Woman Preparing Tea,</em> 1793
                  (199-1885), came into the studio recently, prior to going on
                  loan. The label on the reverse reads, “199-1885 Bigg / Lined,
                  covered with thin / coat of varnish, new stretcher / by Messrs
                  Haines &amp; Sons / 21st July 1893.” I am a great admirer of
                  these labels with their succinct treatment reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The correspondence between the SKM officials and Haines &amp;
                  Sons is in the museum archives and includes many estimates for
                  proposed work.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  In an estimate dated May 25, 1896, section A lists eight
                  paintings for lining (<a href="#fig-33-4"><strong>fig. 33.4</strong></a>). The reason for my good opinion of the Haines &amp; Sons’s
                  glue-paste linings is that I have rarely seen weave emphasis,
                  squashed paint, or moating around impasto—damage to the paint
                  surface that could be attributed to the lining. They used a
                  fine linen for the lining canvas, always a finer weave than
                  the original canvas, although admittedly, they did remove the
                  original tacking edges. Over one hundred years later, the
                  support within the picture plane is still sound. The only
                  problem I have encountered is that, on some paintings, the
                  lining canvas is starting to fail along the fold line. The
                  thin fabric that was used and its brittleness where
                  impregnated with the glue-paste adhesive combine to create
                  lines of weakness at the place of closest contact with the
                  wooden stretcher—hence the strip-linings.

                  One of the paintings listed in the estimate, by David Teniers
                  the Younger (1610–1690),
                  <em>Rocky Landscape with Figures,</em> ca. 1660–1690
                  (1349-1869), came into the studio in 2014 prior to going on
                  loan. The canvas support was sound and in plane. The label on
                  the reverse reads, “1349-1869 Lined, the surface cleaned by /
                  sponging. The old varnish removed by / friction and the
                  picture thinly varnished / by Messrs F. Haines &amp; Sons June
                  27, 1896.” There were two very small areas of lifting paint
                  and a thin film of surface dirt, showing some air exchange
                  into the frame. I fixed the paint with sturgeon glue and
                  removed the dirt from front and back. It is satisfying to be
                  able to link the estimate to the painting and see that the
                  treatment was carried out and was effective.

                  In the early days, paintings were sent to Haines &amp; Sons’s
                  premises. It was from Jacob Simon’s talk at the British
                  Association of Paintings Conservator-Restorers conference, A
                  Changing Art, held in London in 2016, that I learned of the
                  correspondence with Haines &amp; Sons regarding the equipment
                  for setting up a lining studio within the SKM in 1892 ([[Simon
                  2017]]). The requirements included a 41 1/2 x 33 inch (105.4 x
                  83.8 cm) slate, four irons, and a set of looms of different
                  sizes—at a cost of £5 for the slate, 25 shillings for each
                  iron, and £6.15s for the looms.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In an estimate for lining and other treatments for four
                  pictures, dated October 28, 1892, is a painting by John James
                  Chalon,
                  <em>Hastings: Boats Making the Shore in a Breeze,</em> 1819
                  (168 × 245 cm) (FA.234[O]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  The cost of the lining was £1.10s; to remove the surface dirt
                  and thinly varnish the painting was to cost £1.5s. The
                  painting is still in good condition; both support and paint
                  layers are sound. Interestingly, Haines &amp; Sons may have
                  preferred to continue to carry out the work on their premises
                  rather than at the museum. In a postscript to the estimate, it
                  states, “The price quoted—for doing them away from the Museum:
                  if done at the Museum the cost would be somewhat more.”

                  In the
                  <em>Seventh Report of the Science and Art Department,</em>
                  from1860, Redgrave recorded that he had started to place
                  paintings at eye level under glass to protect them
                  ([[Committee of Council on Education 1860]]). From the frames
                  themselves we can see that the glass was placed in a
                  removable, narrow, gilded frame that was inserted into the
                  picture frame from the front. Protection front and back, even
                  if not fully sealed, appears to have provided a useful buffer
                  to fluctuating relative humidity and significantly slowed the
                  deposition of dirt, particularly on the reverse.

                  The first donations and bequests in the 1850s to 1880s, which
                  were near-contemporary art at the time, have benefited the
                  most from the preventive conservation practices. Scanning a
                  list of paintings acquired in 1869, the Townshend Bequest, I
                  noted that many were less than ten years old. Similarly, of
                  the ninety-five paintings acquired in 1886, a large number
                  were between ten and twenty years old. It is true that some
                  exhibit drying cracks from the use of materials popular at the
                  time, but the significant point is that no age cracks are yet
                  obvious on many of these paintings. The recent work preparing
                  the reserve collection for its move to East London has shown
                  that most of the paintings with problems are those that either
                  had no backing or had lost it.

                  I have not been able to establish exactly when the Art Work
                  Room was created, nor how many people worked there, but it was
                  active in the first half of the twentieth century and was the
                  beginning of an in-house conservation department. Harry Rogers
                  was head of Paintings Conservation in 1973, when my
                  predecessor, Susannah Edmunds, joined the V&amp;A. Rogers had
                  started work at the museum in the Art Work Room (A.W.R.) at
                  sixteen. His employment at the V&amp;A spanned over fifty
                  years, with a break during World War II, when he was in the
                  armed forces. We frequently find handwritten labels on
                  backboards, such as, “Glazed and backed up, A.W.R.” along with
                  the date. When a painting by Daniel Hardy,
                  <em>Sunday Afternoon</em> (F.16) was prepared for loan a few
                  years ago, I found a label in Harry Rogers’s handwriting on
                  the reverse: “Frame cleaned, re / paired and Backed up / By
                  A.W.R 22.4.21.”

                  Of the 102 canvases hanging in the Paintings Galleries at the
                  V&amp;A, forty are unlined, while a further eleven have
                  original linings. Within the Paintings Galleries there are
                  three rooms dedicated to oil paintings from the Sheepshanks,
                  Dyce, Townshend, Forster, and Ionides gifts or bequests. In
                  many cases, the collectors had bought the paintings directly
                  from the artists (<a href="#fig-33-5"><strong>fig. 33.5</strong></a>). I am certain that the reason so many of these paintings
                  are well preserved, with many canvases still unlined and not
                  in need of lining, is due to the early policy of glazing and
                  backing.

                <p>
                  Having covered the V&amp;A’s treatment history, I’d now like
                  to discuss some recent treatments—both preventive and
                  interventive. With only one exception, the following were
                  undertaken in the last decade.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>Portrait of Frederick Louis</em> (Prince of Wales from
                  1707 to 1751), painted in 1716 by René Auguste Constanyn
                  (active 1712–1726) (627-1901), is an unlined
                  eighteenth-century canvas still on its original strainer. The
                  painting was requested for loan in 2014. As my initial check
                  of its suitability for loan was done in the off-site store
                  without taking the painting out of its frame, it was only when
                  it came into the studio that I saw it was unlined. I repaired
                  the small tear near the upper edge, as well as two tears on
                  the tacking edges using a mixture of wheat-starch paste and
                  sturgeon glue, and treated the slight canvas deformations.
                  There is no doubt that the canvas is weakened: aside from the
                  tears, the strainer bar marks are pronounced, and there is
                  overall cupping of the ground and paint layers. The canvas was
                  also starting to tear around the nails securing it to the
                  strainer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I used Japanese paper (<em>sekishu</em>), adhered with
                  wheat-starch paste, to give some additional support to the
                  tacking edges after first coloring it with a wash of acrylic
                  emulsion. I felt that these local treatments would be
                  sufficient for the time being. Tastes have changed; we are
                  more tolerant of surface defects as the price of avoiding
                  lining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>

                  <em>The Opening of the Great Exhibition by Queen Victoria on 1
                    May 1851</em>
                  (1851; oil on canvas; 329-1889) by Henry Courtney Selous
                  (1803–1890) has a glue-paste strip-lining rather than a full
                  lining. I recently found a reference to a payment of £3 17s 6d
                  to Haines &amp; Sons in 1904 for repairing and cleaning this
                  painting, so it seems likely that they carried out the strip
                  lining.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  After three incidents of treating small dents and tears, the
                  Selous has been glazed, despite its size (169.5 x 241.9 cm)
                  and the delicate composition frame. In addition to the
                  backboard, it has a stretcher bar lining of polyester
                  sailcloth. Typically, we give unlined paintings stretcher bar
                  linings, and if there are no cross members, as was the case
                  with Prince Frederick’s portrait, we will attach polyester
                  wadding to the backboard with Velcro so that it is held within
                  the stretcher or strainer window.

                  The <em>Train Bleu</em> theatre cloth (S.316-1978) was
                  commissioned by Diaghilev for the Ballets Russes for the
                  ballet of the same name. The image is an enlarged version of a
                  sketch of <em>Two Women Running Along a Beach</em>, painted in
                  1922 by Pablo Picasso (1881–1973). The sketch measures 32.6 x
                  41.2 centimeters (gouache on plywood, Musée National Picasso,
                  Paris). There is a large off-white border around the image on
                  the stage cloth; nevertheless, it represents an extraordinary
                  transformation in scale: the stage cloth measures 10.4 x 12.75
                  meters. It was painted by Prince Alexander Schervachidze
                  (1867–1968) who made designs for several Ballet Russes
                  productions. Picasso was so impressed with the result that he
                  signed it with a dedication to Diaghilev.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The stage cloth proved very popular and was subsequently used
                  as a front cloth and flown before every performance. Usually,
                  stage cloths have a reinforced border with tie points along
                  the upper edge to allow them to be easily attached to a fly
                  bar in each theatre. Instead, the <em>Train Bleu</em> front
                  cloth had been nailed directly through the upper edge, often
                  after being folded to adjust its height to fit different
                  theatres. The repeated nailing of the upper edge to battens
                  and subsequent removal had taken their toll, and there were so
                  many tears in the upper 150 centimeters that added together
                  they came to 200 centimeters in length. The weight of the
                  canvas and the fact that all the tears were at the top raised
                  fears of a zipper effect if the tears started to propagate.
                </p>

                  This was the less recent project: it was twenty years ago that
                  Éowyn Kerr, then a student intern, prepared various adhesive
                  samples for tensile testing, which was carried out by
                  Christina Young at Imperial College.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  The results suggested that repairing the tears with polyamide
                  welding powder<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  would be strong enough to support the weight of the canvas
                  without any patches or lining the upper section, which we
                  wanted to avoid. The support is a jute fabric consisting of
                  nine horizontal strips sewn together. It was helpful that the
                  ends of the threads along the tears were frayed, providing
                  more surface area for the adhesive.

                  At it happened, the loan that started the investigation was
                  cancelled, and it was not until 2005 that the treatment took
                  place. It was a joint project with Jim Dimond, who recruited
                  several other colleagues to help.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  The <em>Train Bleu</em> has since been flown in five
                  exhibitions and is holding up so far. It was in the V&amp;A
                  exhibition
                  <em>Diaghilev and the Golden Age of the Ballet Russes
                    1909–1929,</em>
                  in London, in 2012, and at the final venue in Washington, DC,
                  in 2013.

                  Three Korean paintings on cotton were acquired recently, which

                  They arrived rolled and had many distortions. They were
                  returned to plane through moisture treatments while on a loom.
                  Strips of kraft paper were attached to the canvas edges and
                  then wetted and attached to the loom (<a href="#fig-33-6"><strong>fig. 33.6</strong></a>). Humidity was introduced to the reverse of the canvas with
                  damp blotting paper through Gore-Tex. The paper shrinkage
                  exerted tension as the whole structure slowly dried. Fiona
                  Rutka, a student intern, did most of the work on these
                  paintings. They were put onto new stretchers over loose
                  linings of polyester sailcloth.

                  Preparations for a touring exhibition of the works of John
                  Constable meant that 50 oil sketches passed through the studio
                  in 2010.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  <em>Landscape with Double Rainbow,</em> 1812 (33.7 x 38.4 cm)
                  (328-1888), is on a mixture of supports, paper adhered to
                  canvas as well as an original lining. Constable used a variety
                  of supports for his oil sketches: frequently a homemade paper
                  laminate, primed in different colors. At other times he reused
                  his own canvas paintings, cutting them into small sections
                  ([[Costaras and Richardson 2010]]). It is possible that in
                  this instance he tried to peel off one layer of paper to get a
                  fresh surface to paint on; the surface is irregular, with
                  sections of paper missing. Clare Richardson and I speculated
                  that Constable used the nearest support to hand to capture the
                  fleeting atmospheric effect. An X-ray image shows at least one
                  other composition within the support ([[Costaras and
                  Richardson 2010|, 151]]).

                <p>
                  Constable painted over the top of the torn paper and canvas
                  support regardless, lined it, and continued to work on it.
                  When it came to the studio, the canvases were delaminating and
                  the edges were frail. Wheat-starch paste was used to reattach
                  the two canvases and left to dry under weight. With the help
                  of Susan Catcher, our colleague in Paper Conservation, we
                  strip-lined the painting with wheat-starch paste and Japanese
                  paper (<a href="#fig-33-7"><strong>fig. 33.7</strong></a>). Wheat-starch paste was also used to attach the paper to
                  the strainer. Serendipitously, the shrinkage of the paper as
                  it dried exerted a gentle tension on the canvas without making
                  it too taut.

                  The above are just a few examples of types of canvas
                  treatments undertaken at the V&amp;A in recent years, and they
                  give a sense of the variety of the works in the collection.

                  Access versus Preservation—Finding a Balance
                </h2>

                  <em>The Ballet Scene from Meyerbeer’s Opera “Robert le
                    Diable,”</em>
                  1876, by Edgar Degas (76.6 x 81.3 cm) (CAI.19), is another
                  unlined canvas painting; it provided a catalyst for a change
                  in approach to lending. The painting is frequently requested
                  for loan and had been to fifteen venues with five exhibitions
                  in eighteen years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My attitude about what constitutes a suitable condition for a
                  painting to go on loan has changed over time. Once, I would be
                  concerned if a painting already had a documented problem, but
                  then it occurred to me that I should be more protective of
                  paintings that are still in good condition. This led me to
                  propose to my curatorial colleagues that we try to limit the
                  amount that unlined canvases travel. I argued that the Degas
                  has an important quality, in that it has not had any
                  interventive treatment, and that this is a state we should try
                  and preserve. The curators agreed with me, particularly in the
                  context of this group of gifts and bequests from
                  nineteenth-century collectors, and since 2007 that has been
                  our unofficial policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, if paintings are unlined, this is immediately flagged,
                  often by the loans curator, and an alternative offered, if
                  possible. There isn’t always an acceptable substitute, as is
                  the case with the Degas. However, if such a painting is
                  requested for a multivenue loan, we might agree to just one
                  venue, one accessible by a single-truck journey, and decline
                  it for the rest. At the time of the symposium, in October
                  2019, the Degas was at an exhibition in Paris, and this is the
                  reason it did not go to the second venue in Washington, DC. We
                  receive more loan requests for the Degas than for any other
                  painting in the collection.

                  Travelling does cause wear and tear. An unlined canvas by
                  Lawrence Alma Tadema (1836–1912)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                  had recently gone on loan when it was requested again two
                  years later. On checking it for the second loan, I found tears
                  had developed along the fold line. Even if a well-designed
                  packing case does a good job of reducing shocks and vibration,
                  they can be greater during the movement of paintings on
                  A-frames within museums at either end of the journey, as shock
                  loggers have shown ([[Saunders, Sitwell, and Staniforth 1991|,
                  320]]). By limiting the number of trips these unlined canvases
                  make, we are trying to postpone the moment when lining or
                  strip-lining becomes necessary, and this is another aspect to
                  our approach to conserving canvas.
                </p>
                <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  Inevitably, the public program sets conservation priorities to
                  a large extent, but we do aim to devote time to the core
                  collection each year. The evidence from the recent survey of
                  the reserve collection highlights the importance of backings
                  in the preservation of canvas paintings. There was a strong
                  correlation between the paintings with evidence of weakened
                  canvas—shown by pronounced cupping, stretcher bar marks, and
                  flaking paint—with those that had no backing. In contrast,
                  many of the canvases that have had backings since they were
                  acquired in the nineteenth century (in a few cases the same
                  backings) appear sound and often have no obvious age cracks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The decant of the reserve collection provided an opportunity
                  to apply preventive conservation wherever it was lacking.
                  Between the unlined canvases and the nineteenth-century
                  glue-paste linings, with due credit to the work of my
                  predecessors throughout the twentieth century, I have not had
                  to carry out a single lining in the twenty-five years that I
                  worked at the V&amp;A. I carried out many strip-linings and
                  tear repairs. Collaborating with my colleagues in Paper
                  Conservation, I have found many uses for Japanese paper and
                  wheat-starch paste.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the foreseeable future, I expect
                  <em>The Martyrdom of St. Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins,</em>
                  mentioned earlier, will need relining. This fifteenth-century
                  painting was one of the V&amp;A’s earliest acquisitions, in
                  1857, and it was already lined when it arrived in the museum.
                  The tacking edges of the lining canvas are frail, and it is
                  fairly large: 163.3 x 232.4 cm (see
                  <a href="#fig-33-1"><strong>fig. 33.1</strong></a>). When the time comes that this and other canvases do need
                  lining, will there be anyone who does enough paste lining to
                  be skilled at it? Although minimal treatments have their
                  place, I am concerned about a gap in skills due to lack of
                  practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond paste lining, it is better still to have experience
                  with a range of different lining techniques—and thus to be
                  able to choose the most appropriate method in each case. After
                  hearing the talks at the 2019 Conserving Canvas symposium, I
                  am very hopeful that the Getty Foundation initiative, of which
                  the symposium was a part, will ensure that the expertise
                  continues to exist.

                        During the recent survey we discovered another unlined

                        <em>A Member of the Howard Family of Ashstead,</em> by a
                        follower of Sir Godfrey Kneller, ca. 1700, oil on canvas
                        (P.30-1970). The paint surface is cupping on this
                        painting too, and there is a pronounced oval stretcher
                        or strainer mark, but the paint appears secure, and I
                        would not consider it in need of structural treatment at
                        this stage.

                  Going back in time through the collections of the National
                  Galleries in Rome, material traces can be found in the ancient
                  linings that describe the modus operandi of the first
                  restorers. However, few examples are preserved from the
                  nineteenth century, probably due to the excessive use of
                  glues. More numerous are the older testimonies, and these show
                  greater care in the choice of canvas, more discreet use of
                  glues, less impact of pressure and heat. Observation of the
                  material data finally allows us to link a defined modus
                  operandi to restorers hitherto only known by name through
                  documents. The path backwards allows us to assess evidence
                  dating back to the mid-seventeenth century. Alongside the
                  in-depth study of minimal methodologies, the study of this
                  method appears to us to be a fundamental premise for a
                  complete reevaluation of traditional methodologies, as they
                  are not only functional to the test of centuries but also
                  environmentally friendly and totally reversible.

                <p>
                  Rome’s National Gallery, composed of the Palazzo Barberini and
                  Galleria Corsini, was born at the end of the nineteenth
                  century, the fruit of an institutional will to create a
                  national museum in the capital soon after the creation of the
                  unified Italian state. Its masterpieces have different
                  origins,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  the histories of which it is often difficult to reconstruct.
                  The collection is rich in historical technical material, as in
                  many works in our collection ancient linings are still
                  preserved.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  However, it is not always easy to discover the archival
                  sources. We have followed two parallel lines of inquiry to
                  better understand the linings from a technical and historical
                  standpoint. On the one hand, we have observed the technical
                  details relating to the canvas and stretcher for works that
                  have never been lined or that have documented ancient linings
                  linked to the Roman context. On the other hand, we have
                  researched the shadowy figures of the craftsmen, who are now
                  difficult to characterize, belonging to anonymous social
                  classes,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  but whom back then must have been celebrities. It is among
                  them that we can identify the first restorers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These two lines of inquiry allow us to reconstruct the work of
                  restorers going back to the seventeenth century, and to flesh
                  out these figures. It is not surprising that we find the first
                  restorers in Rome, where many famous collections were
                  concentrated. These men now have not only a history and
                  biography, but their technique can be reconstructed, in much
                  the same way that artists are identified by their style, thus
                  bringing life to archival sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Starting from the 1950s and going back in time, this paper
                  focuses primarily on the eighteenth century in Rome, which saw
                  a great upsurge in restorations, providing ideal conditions
                  for the development of restoration techniques.

                  The Twentieth Century: A Focus on the Post-War Interventions
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Leaving apart the most recent and better-known years, the
                  first period I want to discuss is the massive campaign of
                  restorations that took place after World War II, when works
                  were retrieved from the hiding places where they had been
                  stored. However, if we look at the numbers involved, only a
                  relatively small percentage of these required structural
                  restoration. As a result, many examples of old linings are
                  still in existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of the conflict, it proved necessary to repair the
                  damage caused by inappropriate and often inclement
                  conservation conditions. Lists were drawn up indicating
                  urgencies and priorities for restoration. Many works are
                  mentioned several times in these lists, perhaps because they
                  are still awaiting intervention. Documents requesting
                  estimates and assessments for the acquisition of materials
                  provide us with information on the techniques employed in
                  these interventions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Among the most active restorers were without doubt the Podio
                  family, originally from Bologna. We have at least a dozen
                  documented linings executed by them, and most of these date
                  from the 1950s (<a href="#fig-34-1"><strong>fig. 34.1</strong></a>) and are still effective as supports for the paintings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  In their estimates, the Podio often indicate hemp as the
                  lining textile used, but more importantly we note that they
                  often repeated the operation they had just concluded with a
                  second lining that involved a double or even a triple layer of
                  glue paste, which would be filtered through the weave and the
                  excess removed through the application of great pressure; the
                  ironing operation, on the other hand, was not repeated.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  The result was a lining of great rigidity, and of high
                  susceptibility to changes in humidity and temperature because
                  of the amount of glue on the reverse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That these linings should still be in place and largely
                  effective is all the more notable. However, it is true that
                  the environment of our galleries is essentially a dry one,
                  with a rather low RH of around 40%—and therefore suitable for
                  the preservation of this kind of restoration. In this context
                  I should mention a curious estimate given by D. Podio for work
                  to be carried out on a <em>Virgin and Child</em> attributed to
                  Raphael, in the Accademia di San Luca. Having recognized it as
                  a transfer, he proposed an initial lining on a hemp canvas,
                  with the consequent ironing and filling, and then a second
                  lining using not less than three hemp canvases and another
                  ironing: “This would give back to the painting the appearance
                  of a painting on wood.” His aim was therefore a rigidity that
                  was not only functional but also aesthetic.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>

                  The Nineteenth Century: A Few Preserved Examples of Linings
                  and of Minimal Intervention
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In the nineteenth century, we find an earlier massive campaign
                  of restoration, which occurred at a time of many acquisitions
                  as a result of bequests. The public aspects of Roman
                  restoration during this period are well known due to the
                  activities of the Camuccini brothers: Pietro, a restorer, and
                  Vincenzo, an inspector of public paintings ([[Giacomini
                  2007]]). Among his collaborators, Vincenzo chose Pietro
                  Palmaroli ([[Köster [1827] 2001|, 123]]; [[Rinaldi 2004]]) and
                  Giuseppe Candida, who moved to Rome from Venice in 1803.
                  Candida brought with him such cultural baggage as his
                  experience in the workshop of Pietro Edwards ([[Conti 2003|,
                  185, 229]]; [[Köster [1827] 2001|, 121]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Restoration practices in the various private collections are
                  less well known. Again, archival documents are of help. In
                  those of the Corsini family we find paintings on which worked
                  G.&nbsp;B. Beretta ([[Ventra 2016]])—a restorer who also worked
                  with Minardi—and going back in time, Palmaroli ([[Cosma 2016|,
                  180ff.]]) and Principe ([[Magnanimi 1980a]]; [[Magnanimi
                  1980b]]). So the same names come up in both the private and
                  public sectors, and through these we will get a better picture
                  of the Roman system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the National Gallery, we have few examples of linings
                  dating back to the nineteenth century, even though the period
                  is rather well known through the historical research cited.
                  Such documentation tends to be of a more theorical (almost
                  sterile) nature, and we are unable to match it with the
                  technical evidence. Just a few linings from the nineteenth
                  century, or even the earlier part of the twentieth, are
                  preserved—a result of the general use of greater quantities of
                  glue paste and of coarser and heavier canvases for linings,
                  which has made them more fragile and more susceptible to
                  changes in relative humidity and temperature ([[Mecklenburg
                  2007]]; [[CESMAR7 2008]]; [[Ciatti and Signorini 2006]];
                  [[Roche 2003]]) than the earlier linings described in some
                  detail in later sections of this paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One example of a painting with a nineteenth-century lining is
                  the <em>Glory of Saint Ignatius</em> (<a href="#fig-34-2"><strong>fig. 34.2</strong></a>)<em>,</em> by A. Pozzo (inventory 1426). The restoration is
                  dated 1884 on the stretcher, the canvas is of a heavy and
                  tightly woven, herringbone weave, and the adhesive rich in
                  animal glue. On the canvas are marks that seem to be the
                  result of burns from the application of hot irons. The
                  stretcher is pine, with crossbars and keys, but it is
                  essentially inadequate; clearly evident on the picture surface
                  are the stretcher marks, as well as flattening of the paint.
                  The inscriptions that accompany the restoration, on the
                  stretcher, are grammatically incorrect, once again relegating
                  the restorers to the “mechanical,” uneducated sphere. Another
                  <em>bozzetto</em> for Pozzo’s tromp l’oeil dome of the church
                  of Saint Ignazio (inventory 1425), has very similar
                  characteristics and was also lined in 1884, so one can infer
                  that it was carried out by the same restorer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many restorations coincided with the acquisition of the
                  painting, for example, Giordano Luca’s
                  <em>Ritratto di capomasteo (Cratete)</em> (inventory 1254),
                  lined by Luigi Bartolucci in 1898. The stretcher may have been
                  preserved from a previous intervention but adapted to make
                  place for keys. The lining canvas is coarse and thick,
                  stained, and has a large seam*.* It is interesting to compare
                  this canvas to those in use by painters at the same time: the
                  same kind of canvas was used for Horace Vernet’s
                  <em>Portrait of Filippo Agricola</em>, painted in the 1820s
                  and never lined.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the nineteenth century (although less than during the
                  eighteenth century), we find evidence of a desire for minimal
                  intervention, both in mending of tears and in strip-linings.
                  It was also Bartolucci who carried out the 1909 strip-lining
                  of Cavallino’s
                  <em>Saint Peter and the Centurion</em> (inventory 1485)<em>,</em>
                  for which (according to his report) he “consolidated the old
                  lining,” thus wisely preserving a lining dating to the end of
                  the eighteenth century that was still functional. Another
                  example is Guido Reni’s <em>Magdalen</em> (inventory1437) (<a href="#fig-34-3"><strong>fig. 34.3</strong></a>), which was never lined but has a very old strip-lining,
                  surviving at least in the upper section.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Proceeding backward through the historical stages, and at the
                  same time reconstructing the techniques, we arrive at the turn
                  of the eighteenth century, at a moment when Rome was an
                  important center in the history of restoration. It is not by
                  chance that this was the case. Rome had a very high
                  concentration of private collections, and the first public
                  ones were coming into being. Nor was it by chance that this
                  occurred almost two centuries from the initial diffusion of
                  canvas as a painting support. The central position of Rome for
                  restoration history is highlighted by the fact that it was the
                  place of origin of many restorers, who were responsible for
                  the spread of Roman restoration techniques. In 1787, Andres
                  left for Naples, and 10 years later Sampieri left to join
                  Puccini in Florence, although the two had already met in Rome
                  ([[Incerpi 2011]]; [[Mazzi 2007]]). A few decades later, in
                  1826, Palmaroli also left, to go to Dresden.

                  Technical Data: Toward the Eighteenth Century
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In contrast to the nineteenth century, in our collection we
                  have a large number of old linings that we can date to the
                  eighteenth century. These are recognizable by their technical
                  characteristics, which we can match with the historical
                  documentation and thus understand the lining process involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A first group includes canvases with a more compact and
                  coarser weave, which have oxidized and darkened because of the
                  amount of glue used. The canvas weave is impregnated with
                  glue, and the lined painting is typically mounted onto
                  chestnut strainers with half lap joints blocked with either
                  nails or pegs, and with stretcher members that have a
                  rectangular cross section. The joints of these strainers have
                  not always been filled (when used, filler forms a barrier
                  against changes in temperature and humidity).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The wood is not always of top quality; stretcher members with
                  different colorings are often found in the same strainer, an
                  indication of the presence of both heart-wood and sap-wood.
                  This group also includes strainers that are less refined,
                  evidently constructed with remainders of wood, with members
                  made with either chestnut or poplar.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A second group includes older linings, which we can date to
                  the first half of the eighteenth century, that have rather
                  pale lining canvases. They have a plain, light, open weave not
                  impregnated with glue, and are mounted onto chestnut
                  strainers. The stretcher members are rectangular in cross
                  section and have shouldered bridle joints, which have been
                  filled.

                  The Prestretching of the Lining Canvas
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Upon closer observation of paintings in the collection, I
                  deduced that the lining canvas was stretched by attaching it
                  to the strainer with sprigs or brads. The lining would then be
                  wetted to slacken the canvas, which could then be made taut
                  again with the same sprigs, which at this point would be
                  hammered back and bent to secure the canvas (<a href="#fig-34-4"><strong>fig. 34.4</strong></a>). This preparation of the lining canvas would greatly weaken
                  it, making it more like the original canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I use the term <em>system</em> for lining with glue paste,
                  rather than referring to it simply as an adhesive, because the
                  recipe in itself, with all its variants, does not cover the
                  description of the process involved and its effects. In the
                  Roman system, the original canvas is simply attached to the
                  pretensioned lining canvas which, when impregnated with the
                  glue, acquires a certain rigidity. This entails the transfer
                  of the tensions of the original canvas onto the lining canvas,
                  which therefore truly acts as a new support for the work.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  This is the main difference between the Roman and the
                  Florentine systems, as they are still practiced today.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  As a rule, the lining canvas should be chosen to be as similar
                  to the original as possible in terms of weight and weave
                  count,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  but preferably finer and thinner. Canvases of the same period
                  that have never been lined have the same characteristics.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  To carry out the lining, the original canvas—probably faced in
                  order to consolidate the paint layers and protect them—would
                  be laid face down and the adhesive would be spread on the
                  reverse. The lining canvas—already stretched onto the strainer
                  as described above—would then be placed over this and made to
                  adhere to the original canvas simply by massaging the reverse
                  with the hands, which would also exert pressure.

                <h3 id="recipes" tabindex="-1">Recipes</h3>
                <p>
                  Because recipes were considered workshop secrets, we do not
                  know their details, but we can imagine that the main
                  ingredients remained constant while the additives would vary,
                  and these were the elements that were the workshop’s “secret.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is likely that the use of animal glue became necessary when
                  serious structural problems were encountered, such as how to
                  reduce serious deformations, tears, or blistering of the paint
                  layers. The adhesive properties of flour-paste glues are
                  linked to the presence of gluten, which is extracted after
                  fifteen minutes of cooking at 70°C–80°C. The addition of glues
                  can therefore only occur after this operation has been carried
                  out, as the temperature used would alter the collagen and
                  therefore its adhesive properties. In the Roman recipe, one
                  uses bone glue, <em>colla cervione.</em> It is rich in
                  impurities, short-chained, and both fragile and stiff, while
                  also having great adhesive strength and resistance to sudden
                  shocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ratio of flour to glue is the critical element in the
                  formulation of the glue-paste adhesive, on which depends its
                  response to changes in humidity and to biological attack
                  ([[Fuster-Lopez 2017]]). It is now clear that all the
                  additives were included in the formulation to render the paste
                  more elastic and to retard its drying ([[Lavorini 2007]];
                  [[Laroche and Saccarello 1996]]), and that they also play a
                  role in the aging of the paste ([[Ackroyd 1996]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  That the original basic recipe contained little or no animal
                  glue can be deduced from the color of the adhesive, which in
                  the older linings is very light, although it should be darker
                  because the type of flour used was less refined and therefore
                  full of husks, and itself darker in color. So the lightness of
                  the adhesive must be related to the amount of animal glue
                  present in the recipe. Orlandi, in the
                  <em>Abecedario pittorico</em>, first published in 1704,
                  proposes a flour-paste glue, without the addition of animal
                  glue ([[Orlandi 1753|, 548]]). We know that the glue was added
                  soon after; for example, Edwards, only fifty years later in
                  Venice, suggests adding German glue, that is strong ox glue
                  (<em>colla forte</em>). Edwards also uses a starch-paste glue
                  for his facings and for localized consolidation; and in his
                  descriptions of works requiring restoration, he refers to
                  patches that are poorly attached because of the inadequacy of
                  the “paste made from gluten” (<em>gluttini</em>) ([[Tiozzo
                  2000|, 152]]). The difference in terminology, which alludes to
                  a material difference, continues over time up to the Forni
                  manual, which still reports patches that are either “pasted or
                  glued on” ([[Bonsanti and Ciatti 2004|, ch. 3]]).
                </p>
                <h3 id="ironing" tabindex="-1">Ironing</h3>
                <p>
                  At the very beginning of the use of lining systems, the
                  pressure and heat applied were very light and gentle. But
                  before long the initial massaging of the reverse was
                  associated with heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Orlandi, we learn that the canvases were left beneath a
                  uniform weight provided by a heavy panel, but that the various
                  thicknesses of the paint were nevertheless protected by layers
                  of paper or even felt ([[Orlandi 1753|, 548]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The introduction of heat, generally termed
                  <em>stiratura</em> (ironing), is documented by Edwards, who
                  describes an ingenious system in which heated sand was placed
                  on the reverse of the lining. We have found residues of this
                  sand, confirming the practice as recounted in the sources
                  ([[Tranquilli 1996]]). This system assures even pressure while
                  at the same time adapting to the material nature and profiles
                  of the paint layers without causing excessive flattening of
                  the texture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The reference to irons in relation to the
                  <em>stiratura</em> is clearly made in Crespi’s 1756 letter to
                  Algarotti, in a passage in which he relates what seems to be a
                  consolidation procedure from the reverse. In this passage,
                  Crespi expressly refers to the irons used for starching;
                  therefore, it really is the same irons used in laundering that
                  are meant ([[Bottari 1822–25]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  At this juncture during the lining procedure, after the
                  ironing, the original tacking edges were turned over the
                  strainer (but often they were included in the front surface,
                  thus slightly enlarging the dimensions of the picture) and
                  then secured with nails or glue. The old method is easily
                  distinguishable in that the sprigs used to stretch the lining
                  canvas are visible under the painted canvas edges (see
                  <a href="#fig-34-4"><strong>fig. 34.4</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The entire procedure described is observable in the
                  <em>Adoration of the Shepherds</em>, by Cesari (inventory
                  1120) (<a href="#fig-34-5"><strong>fig. 34.5</strong></a>). The work is part of the Torlonia bequest (one of the cores
                  of the museum collection) and was acquired by the Torlonia
                  from the Soderini family.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Soderini were one of the main patrons of Marco Benefial, a
                  painter who always worked with Domenico Michelini, who was the
                  most important restorer in Rome in the first half of the
                  eighteenth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  We can therefore infer that Michelini also worked for the
                  Soderini, and we can attribute this lining to him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is interesting to observe that in the eighteenth century
                  there were famous “duo” collaborations between restorers and
                  painters, in which the restorer could not paint at all and
                  would carry out the lining, the filling, and sometimes the
                  cleaning,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  while the painter would retouch.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                  Such famous duos include D. Michelini and M. Benefial, and
                  later G. Principe and P. Anesi or D. Corvi.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  (See [Cerasuolo’s
                  paper](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/35-Merucci/paper-5)

                </p>
                <p>
                  Documents show the restorer Giovanni Principe, heir and
                  son-in-law of Michelini, working in the same environment where
                  Giovanni Torlonia had his business. Therefore, it is easy to
                  imagine that they had business interests in common. However,
                  many of the linings that have been preserved bear the Torlonia
                  seal, which dates from the time when the inventory of the
                  collection was drawn up, at the very beginning of the
                  nineteenth century.

                  To conclude our survey going back in time, the oldest dated
                  lining in the Barberini Galleries dates to the middle of the
                  seventeenth century. The presence of the seal on the strainer
                  dates its assembly, and therefore the lining of the painting,
                  to 1641–1642. The strainer is of chestnut with shouldered
                  bridle joints that are not blocked, and a fine, regularly
                  woven, plain-weave lining canvas, in every way comparable to a
                  contemporary canvas that has never been lined (<a href="#fig-34-6"><strong>fig. 34.6</strong></a>).

                  Among the paintings in our Gallery, we have many works lined
                  with wax resin, a system that spread during the 1960s, perhaps
                  in pursuit of an ideal of modernity. If we compare two
                  <em>pendants</em> by Benefial, one lined with the wax-resin
                  system (inventory 1182) (<a href="#fig-34-7"><strong>fig. 34.7</strong></a>) and the other lined with glue-paste (inventory 1183) (<a href="#fig-34-8"><strong>fig. 34.8</strong></a>), the difference demonstrates how the wax-resin system has a
                  far greater impact on the perception of the painting. The
                  different saturation of the colors caused the original link
                  between the two paintings to be lost. Therefore, it is
                  essential to consider all the effects of the conservation
                  method used to preserve a painting.
                </p>

                  Seeking to implement a minimal structural intervention
                  respectful of the aesthetic qualities of the works in our
                  collection, our studio is focusing on developing thread by
                  thread mending techniques for tears, as for Maratti’s
                  <em>Portrait of</em> <em>Cardinal Barberini</em> (inventory
                  5001), as well as on a program of preventive conservation.
                  This is also what led us to study again the ancient lining
                  systems with glue paste, which are still effective after
                  centuries, sustainable from an environmental point of view,
                  and an almost unique example of a completely reversible
                  intervention, as for instance in the <em>bozzetto</em> for the
                  <em>Vision of Saint Romualdo</em> (<a href="#fig-34-9"><strong>fig. 34.9</strong></a>) by Sacchi (inventory 4632), which has been delined.

                        Their fame made them the object of visits from important
                        personalities. For example, De Brosse paid a visit in
                        1739–40 to a certain “Domenico,” maybe the very same
                        Michelini mentioned later in this paper, perhaps still
                        hunting for curiosities and secrets. Goethe’s visit to
                        the restorer Andres in Naples on March 15, 1787,
                        however, was undertaken in a completely different
                        spirit. Goethe says he cannot describe the restorer’s
                        art; due to the difficulty of the task he was unable to
                        describe the happy solutions found by the restorer.
                        (Andres worked in Rome for the Borghese, and then went
                        to Naples, invited by Hackert, and became restorer at
                        court.)

                        This paper discusses only structural interventions. The
                        aesthetic restoration of the painting surface has been
                        carried out by other restorers—in some instances
                        repeatedly.

                        The associated ironing is rather heavy handed, perhaps
                        done with a roller, and it is not unusual to find the
                        imprint of the canvas in the paint layers as a visual
                        effect resulting from this process.

                        From documents in the archive, we know that in 1924 the
                        strip in the lower section was exchanged for a wider one
                        to repair a tear.

                        enables the lining canvas to act as the new support.

                        Among the different glue-paste lining systems, in the
                        Florentine system the painting is never left free; even
                        when not stretched onto the stretcher, the canvas is
                        always in a state of tension through the attachment of
                        bands of paper glued at the edges. It is clear that this
                        system aims at the control of canvas deformations
                        differently ([[Lavorini 2007]]).

                        Pietro Edwards suggests canvases finer than the original
                        ones. In the
                        <em>Obblighi ed incombenze dell’Ispettore al ristauro
                          generale dei pubblici quadri,</em>
                        he writes, “Che non si ometta di foderare il quadro per
                        evitare la spesa delle costose tele e che queste siano
                        sempre di grana più fine della tela vecchia, perché
                        essendo il contrario non legano bene” (Do not omit
                        lining the painting in order to avoid the expense of a
                        lining canvas, which must be finer, because if it is
                        coarser the adhesion will be poor) ([[Tiozzo 2000|,
                        122]]).

                        Pamphili are cited in {De Marchi 2016}. In the Palazzo
                        della Cancelleria, he worked with Ventura Lamberti,
                        Benefial’s teacher. For the Ruspoli family, he prepared
                        the canvas for Trevisani to paint a Saint Francis. For
                        the Giustiniani, he restored the first version of
                        Caravaggio’s <em>Saint Matthew.</em> For the Pellegrini
                        church, he cleaned Reni’s <em>Trinity</em> and repaired
                        a panel painted by the Cavalier d’Arpino (<em>Madonna, Saint Francesco, and Saint Agostino</em>). For San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, he worked on
                        Maratti’s copy of the <em>Madonna and Saints.</em> The
                        Albani family introduced him at the Savoy court.
                        Poerson, director of the French Academy in Rome and
                        president of the Academy of Saint Luke, tells of his
                        restoration for the Odescalchi family, together with B.
                        Luti. Finally, he worked also for the Corsini and the
                        Soderini, being the most important restorer of his time
                        in Rome.

                        Edwards, in his set of guidelines, insists on this point
                        in order to define a profession which was quite
                        distinct, and in the process of evolving, emphasizing
                        the mechanical and structural operations. He criticized
                        those who believed that it was sufficient to know how to
                        paint to become a restorer. Where the retouching
                        involved more than simple losses, and larger areas of
                        painting were required, he looked for painters whose
                        style was as near as possible to that of the original
                        painting ([[Tiozzo 2000]]).

                        We know that important painters also worked as
                        restorers, and we know the effectiveness of their
                        structural interventions. For example, Ciro Ferri, a
                        well-known painter who also worked in the art market and
                        as a restorer, doing both structural repairs (patches)
                        and retouching ([[Marinetti 2007|, 29–46, 179]]).
                        Moreover, Bellori recounts a restoration by the young
                        Maratti, in 1672, on Annibale Carracci’s
                        <em>Nativity</em> (originally in Loreto, now in the
                        Louvre) ([[Ciatti 2009|, 99]]; [[Conti 2003|, 107]]). It
                        should be noted that these were well-known painters, so
                        this work was not simply a fallback for unknown artists
                        in financial difficulties but reflects a desire to
                        establish an autonomous profession, with its own
                        specific subject matter, independent from the field of
                        painting.

                  In 2016, after the flooding of the temporary storage area of
                  the Musée Girodet of Montargis, sixty-nine paintings were
                  brought to the Centre de Recherche et de restauration des
                  Musées de France (C2RMF) for restoration. The works showed
                  various structural and aesthetic alterations due to their
                  prolonged immersion. The aims of the interventions were to
                  reestablish the cohesion of the multilayer system to ensure
                  its conservation over time and to improve the presentation of
                  the paintings. The restoration campaign of this corpus allowed
                  the authors to study the behavior of works according to their
                  age, including old alterations and earlier restorations, and
                  notably the presence of old backing supports. Different types
                  of structural restoration treatment (modern or traditional
                  practices) were then chosen depending on the sensitivity and
                  state of conservation of each painting. The methodological
                  approach of the interventions is presented through a case
                  study of a work presenting a particular restoration problem,
                  the <em>Sacrifice of Abraham,</em> by a follower of Maertens
                  De Vos.

                  On May 31, 2016, the failure of a dam on the Loing canal, a
                  tributary of the river Seine, completely flooded the temporary
                  storage area of the Musée Girodet in Montargis, France.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  As a result, 182 paintings, 450 sculptures, and 1,230 drawings
                  were immersed in water for three days. After emergency
                  conservation measures on site, fifty-one paintings on canvas
                  of importance or presenting complex conservation problems (or
                  both) were brought to the Centre de Recherche et de
                  restauration des Musées de France (C2RMF) for
                  conservation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Among the fifty-one paintings, all painted oils (except one
                  painted with gouache), four dated from the sixteenth century,
                  eighteen from the seventeenth century, eight from the

                  Numerous alterations due to their prolonged water immersion
                  could be seen on the canvas supports and on the paint layers.
                  The aim of the conservation interventions was to stop the
                  degradation process of these paintings, to ensure their
                  conservation over time, and to improve their visual
                  presentation. Various structural operations were carried out,
                  in particular, relining with traditional, synthetic, or mixed
                  techniques, while taking care to adapt the treatments to the
                  specific problems of each artwork. Several teams of private
                  conservators were selected by the collection managers of the
                  Musée Girodet to work in the C2RMF workshops for two years.
                  They were thus able to benefit from studio space, specific
                  equipment, logistical means, and the assistance of the
                  center’s professionals, both curators and scientists.

                  This paper first presents a synthesis of the multidisciplinary
                  study carried out on this corpus of immersed works based on
                  archival study of the material history of the artworks,
                  detailed condition reports, scientific imaging, and analysis.
                  We will then review the different types of structural
                  treatments carried out by conservators during this campaign,
                  in particular relining with different adhesives and
                  techniques. Finally, we will present one case study, the
                  conservation of <em>The Sacrifice of Abraham</em> by a
                  follower of Maertens De Vos.

                  Behavior of a Corpus of Artworks Immersed for Seventy-Two
                  Hours
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The behavior of paintings during and after immersion is linked
                  to the physical and chemical properties of their constitutive
                  materials and the painting technique, as well as the past
                  intervention history of the artworks and their prior state of
                  conservation. A canvas not only naturally oxidizes and becomes
                  brittle over time, storage conditions also affect aging,
                  especially when artworks are stored under poor conditions.
                  Examination of the fifty-one paintings showed that forty of
                  them had already undergone conservation treatments prior to
                  the flood, including major structural intervention for
                  thirty-one of them, sometimes even at the C2RMF. Two had been
                  transferred; twenty-five had been lined with glue paste, one
                  with wax resin, and two with synthetic adhesives; and one had
                  been mounted on cardboard. In addition, many of the paintings
                  that had not been entirely relined had reinforcing patches
                  added to their back, and one of them had been strip lined.
                  Most of the paintings from the sixteenth and seventeenth
                  centuries had been either transferred or lined using the
                  traditional method with glue paste, while some from the
                  eighteenth century had been lined with polyvinyl acetate (PVA)
                  materials. Artworks from nineteenth century had undergone
                  fewer structural conservation interventions but were more
                  often treated with a large number of patches on the back of
                  the paintings.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Canvas is a hygroscopic material that swells in the presence
                  of water and shrinks upon drying if it is not properly
                  stretched on a frame ([[Roche 2003]]). Consequently, paintings
                  that had too weak a frame or were not sufficiently stretched
                  suffered particularly during the flood. In addition,
                  twenty-eight out of thirty-one past linings peeled off,
                  partially or completely; only three linings of small-format
                  paintings retained their mechanical properties. To limit the
                  shrinkage of the canvases at the time of the rescue,
                  conservators removed eighteen paintings from their stretchers
                  and placed them on wooden boards. They also stapled a certain
                  number of canvases to their stretchers. Nevertheless, many
                  canvases were distorted during drying and some shrank at their
                  edges or at tears. Indeed, tears were observed on thirty-five
                  of the fifty-one paintings. Twenty paintings had old tears
                  that had been treated in the past, and fifteen had new, more
                  complex tears corresponding to traumas suffered during the
                  flooding (<a href="#fig-35-1"><strong>fig. 35.1</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The swelling and subsequent shrinking of the canvas during
                  first immersion and then drying caused not only deformations
                  to the canvas itself but also loss of adhesion, and sometimes
                  powdering, of the preparation layer. The canvas and the paint
                  layers form a heterogeneous multilayer system. When the canvas
                  swells, the paint layers separate from the support because
                  their elasticity is limited. In addition, the physicochemical
                  properties of some preparation layers can exacerbate the split
                  between the support and the paint layers. Clay preparation
                  layers may contain swelling clays and are often more sensitive
                  to water than preparation layers made of calcium carbonate.
                  Furthermore, lean preparation layers made with animal glue are
                  more reactive than oil preparation layers. Most of the
                  sixteenth- to eighteenth-century artworks’ preparation layers
                  contain clay (generally red, brown, or green in color;
                  <a href="#fig-35-2"><strong>fig. 35.2</strong></a>). According to records, at least thirty-four out of the
                  fifty-one paintings have shown adhesion problems between the
                  paint layers and the support in the past, and thirty-one of
                  these had already been reaffixed. On the paintings that had a
                  clay ground layer, numerous consolidations were made during
                  lining interventions, whereas the reaffixing was more
                  localized on paints with calcium carbonate preparations (white
                  in color in <a href="#fig-35-2"><strong>fig. 35.2</strong></a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  During drying, the shrinking of the canvas led to the failure
                  of adhesion between paint layers and canvas and caused
                  tenting: roof-shape lifting and loss of the paint layer.
                  During the rescue, temporary protection papers (facing) were
                  adhered to the paint layer of thirty-one paintings to limit
                  the loss of paint. As an example, the Francisco de Zurbarán’s
                  painting <em>Saint Jerome in the Desert</em> (<a href="#fig-35-3"><strong>fig. 35.3</strong></a>) suffered greatly during the flood.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  This artwork, painted on a dark clay preparation, was lined at
                  the end of the nineteenth century or at the beginning of the
                  twentieth. In 1981, the paint layer was again reaffixed.
                  During its immersion in water, the materials used for
                  reaffixing and for the lining lost their mechanical
                  properties, and the canvas lining spontaneously peeled off. In
                  this case, the clay nature of the ground layer did affect the
                  level of degradation caused by the immersion in water,
                  especially the loss of cohesion of the paint layer.

                <p>
                  According to Cesare Brandi, matter is structure and aspect,
                  and the aim of conservation is to stop the process of
                  degradation of the artwork and to restore its structural unity
                  to improve the perception of image and color ([[Brandi 2001|,
                  34})}. Additionally, conservation treatments and products must
                  be compatible with the original materials, stable, and as
                  reversible as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1974, the Greenwich conference on comparative lining
                  techniques highlighted the risks incurred by paint layers when
                  moisture, pressure, and heat are applied, particularly with
                  regard to traditional glue-paste and wax-resin techniques
                  ([[Villers 2003b]]). Indeed, these treatments can crush the
                  paint layers, especially the impasto, and can also induce
                  blanching. More recently, new methods of lining with synthetic
                  adhesives have been developed, while traditional methods have
                  evolved to improve the control of the different parameters of
                  the procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The goal of the 2016–2017 interventions was to correct the
                  deformations of the canvas, to reduce the lifting of paint
                  layers, and to restore the cohesion of the multilayer system.
                  Conservation protocols for all the paintings were established
                  by taking into consideration the characteristics of each
                  painting: the physicochemical properties of the original
                  materials, the nature of the alterations, and past
                  conservation treatments. Due to the fragility of the
                  paintings, the conservators intervened very gradually. They
                  alternated operations from the front, such as cleaning, and
                  from the back of the artwork: reduction of deformations,
                  consolidation, and relining, taking care to protect the paint
                  layer with facings when it was necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For all the paintings, the first intervention essentially
                  consisted of locally consolidating the paint layer with
                  sturgeon glue before removing the facings with Bollore paper
                  and hide glue applied during the rescue. Securing the paint
                  layer with new facings made it possible to remove the mud
                  residue, the adhesive, the patches, and the deficient old
                  linings. After the long work of reducing the fabric canvas
                  deformations with controlled humidity and pressure, and
                  stretching the paintings on temporary metallic stretchers or
                  with paper strips on panel as necessary, the localized
                  moisture input and the application of weights made it possible
                  to relax the canvas and bring the edges of the tears closer
                  together before consolidating them by linking them thread to
                  thread.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moisture was also essential to relax the canvas and to allow
                  the paint layer to regain its place in the areas of roof-shape
                  lifting. The conservators then applied facings, often in
                  several layers, to restore the flatness of the paint layer.
                  The supply of moisture and the level of pressure was
                  controlled by using a variety of papers or gauzes with
                  different properties of stretching upon wetting and of tension
                  and shrinkage upon drying, as well as synthetic or natural
                  adhesives at different concentrations ([[Delsaut and Durand
                  1989]]). Facings adhered to the paint layer with glue paste
                  along with moderate heat and moisture were the most successful
                  in flattening the roof-shape lifting back to the surface
                  plane. However, this treatment was not systematic. Throughout
                  the interventions, conservators also used a low-pressure
                  vacuum table, in particular to restore the flatness of the
                  paint layer and to simultaneously consolidate it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another type of intervention was carried out to restore the
                  cohesion of the different layers and the adhesion between the
                  paint layers and the support. Most of the paintings were
                  impregnated from the reverse of the canvas with different
                  adhesives: Aquazol, hide glue, sturgeon glue, and acrylic
                  resins: Beva 371, Plextol B500, Paraloid B72. A total of 41
                  paintings were thus consolidated (<a href="#table-35-2"><strong>table 35.2</strong></a>). Most of the paintings with a red-clay-based preparation
                  layer were consolidated with protein adhesives (animal glues)
                  used in colloidal solutions. Because the clay-based
                  preparations have a significant absorption capacity, this
                  consolidation restores the cohesion within the preparation
                  layer and the adhesion between the different layers. In
                  contrast, white preparations form a more cohesive and rigid
                  layer, so the addition of an aqueous adhesive is likely to
                  accentuate the stresses between the preparation layer and the
                  canvas—which, on more recent paintings, is often more reactive
                  to water. For that reason, synthetic adhesives were used on
                  most artworks with a white preparation layer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To increase the mechanical properties of the original fabric
                  and to stabilize it, thirty-six of the fifty-one paintings
                  were relined. Of the thirty-one paintings that had been lined
                  in the past, all but three had to be relined following the
                  disaster. As mentioned, those paintings whose lining was kept
                  are small format. One was previously lined with glue paste and
                  the other two with vinyl glue, according to previous treatment
                  documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the paint layers showed significant roof-shaped lifting,
                  the traditional relining allowed restoration of the cohesion
                  and the stability of the multilayer system due to the
                  controlled provision of humidity and heat. The operation
                  starts first with the protection of the paint surface with one
                  or more layers of paper adhered with glue paste; then a gauze
                  and a new transfer canvas are applied to the back of the
                  original canvas with glue paste. After drying, the paint layer
                  is returned to the surface plane using controlled ironing
                  (heat and pressure).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mixed treatments consist of applying a gauze with glue paste
                  to the back of the original canvas, sometimes followed by
                  other interlayers, such as nonwoven polyester. The canvas is
                  then lined with a synthetic adhesive: Beva 371 or Plextol
                  B500. These treatments make it possible to obtain a good
                  flattening of the paint layer while minimizing the quantity of
                  moisture added during the relining. (The case study presented
                  below explains in detail this new mixed treatment, which
                  interweaves tradition and modernity.) Finally,
                  moisture-sensitive paints and less-damaged nineteenth-century
                  paintings were relined only with synthetic adhesives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While in the past the majority of paintings were lined with
                  glue paste (twenty-five out of thirty-one), the relining
                  methods were diversified in the 2016–2017 restorations. Out of
                  thirty-six relined paintings, only sixteen were treated with
                  traditional lining adhesives (glue paste), six with mixed
                  adhesives, and fourteen with synthetic adhesives.

                  Case Study: The Sacrifice of Abraham
                </h2>
                <p>
                  <em>The Sacrifice of Abraham</em>, attributed to a follower of
                  Maertens de Vos (sixteenth century), was originally an oil
                  painting on panel; it entered the collections of the Musée
                  Girodet between 1853 and 1857. The museum’s archives indicate
                  that, due to extensive flaking, it was transferred from panel
                  onto canvas in 1960.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a reminder, a transfer is the replacement of the original
                  support of a painting by a new support. Transfer is no longer
                  practiced today; our view on the artworks has changed, and we
                  have set ourselves certain limits for ethical and
                  philosophical reasons. But in the eighteenth century and for
                  some time after, transfer was thought to “bring back
                  life”"[^5] to paintings in poor condition, “saving” them
                  from the ravages of time by giving them “eternal life”
                  ([[B.-F. Lépicié 1752|, 43–44]]). Indeed, some restorers would
                  be awarded the task of transferring the king’s royal paintings
                  to other supports ([[Emile-Mâle 1982|, 225]]). There is
                  therefore a whole corpus of paintings previously transferred,
                  on a part of which it may be necessary to intervene.

                <p>
                  In May 2016, <em>The Sacrifice of Abraham</em> remained
                  submerged for seventy-two hours, due to the disaster that
                  occurred in the Musée Girodet storerooms after the flooding of
                  the Loing river in the city of Montargis. The deep immersion
                  of the painting caused a significant alteration of the support
                  of the artwork: very pronounced roof-shape lifting of the
                  paint layer (<a href="#fig-35-4"><strong>fig. 35.4</strong></a>), separation of the canvas, and—as we discovered
                  later—powdering of the ground layer. The transfer as a whole
                  was weakened, and thus a complete dismounting was necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What was visually disturbing was that the painting appeared to
                  still be on the wooden panel: the cracks, mainly horizontal,
                  followed the grain of the former support and the joints
                  between the former boards were visible, so that anyone facing
                  the painting would have thought that it was still on a wooden
                  panel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first step was some local consolidations with sturgeon
                  glue, using the temporary protection papers glued during the
                  emergency operations carried out in 2016 at the museum. These
                  papers were delicately removed, as well as the crushed flakes
                  that had been spread upside down all over the painting and
                  which could not be put back in place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A first layer of fine paper was applied to the paint layer
                  with glue paste; after drying, this facing allowed the
                  stretcher to be removed without risk. Then we used glue paste
                  to add several other protective layers of facing paper and a
                  cotton gauze onto the painting. As a reminder, glue paste is
                  basically a baked glue made of wheat flour and rabbit skin
                  glue. This strong, reliable protection perfectly matched the
                  damaged surface condition of the paint layer: dismounting a
                  transfer is always a very delicate operation—one that requires
                  a perfect facing, because once the transfer support is
                  removed, the facing is the only way to secure the painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting was stretched on a working stretcher, and then
                  the transfer canvas was gradually dismounted by peeling, using
                  controlled moisture, to loosen all stresses. The removal of
                  the transfer canvas revealed two layers of cotton gauze. As we
                  had suspected, it was indeed a transfer using the traditional
                  “French-style” technique, with glue paste.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The only difference from the traditional technique was that
                  the cotton gauze directly in contact with the original ground
                  was glued with polyvinyl acetate, instead of glue paste. The
                  previous conservator must have thought that this would improve
                  the bonding. The moisture used for the dismounting made the
                  PVA layer swell, and it peeled off without much difficulty (<a href="#fig-35-5"><strong>fig. 35.5</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The dismounting revealed the thick, original chalk ground,
                  which still showed signs of the veins of its former wooden
                  support. The original ground layer was almost wholly
                  preserved, a rare occurrence in the case of a transferred
                  painting. However, its surface was very powdery: the slightest
                  contact with the surface left a white residue on the fingers.
                  If this powdering had obviously facilitated dismounting, as it
                  stood, no further treatment was possible without consolidation
                  of the ground layer—a difficult decision to make, since it
                  would slightly change the nature of the original ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a long discussion, we collectively chose to impregnate
                  it with Plexisol P550 to enable the intervention to continue.
                  We used the Plexisol at low concentration (5%), with volatile
                  solvents, in order not to cause too much penetration of the
                  consolidant into the ground, which would have been likely to
                  optically modify the painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A thin cotton gauze was then glued with glue paste to the
                  reverse side of the painting. It perfectly matched its
                  imperfections. This new temporary support made possible to
                  replace the actual facing, which had been used to dismount the
                  transfer, with a new one that was more flexible, made of two
                  layers of paper. By releasing the painting from some of these
                  constraints, we were able to start flattening the distortions.
                  The deformations were reduced by using the intrinsic
                  properties of the paper and the tensile strength of the glue
                  paste, with the help of a low-pressure table. Gradually,
                  through controlled moistening and drying, most of the
                  deformations were reduced.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The facing was removed next, to allow us to examine the
                  condition of the surface of the painting. There were still
                  some small roof-shape liftings, which were now noticeable due
                  to the removal of the larger ones. These were reduced using
                  local moistening and careful massage to transform small,
                  narrow deformations into larger, but more flexible ones. Then
                  these larger deformations were flattened using a mini
                  low-pressure table, as well as through the local use of paper
                  and glue paste.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once this surface condition was satisfactory, a new facing was
                  applied with glue paste to the painting, in preparation for
                  the adhesion to a new support. The gauze on the reverse was
                  removed because the operations carried out so far on the
                  deformations could have weakened its adhesion. It was replaced
                  by two new thin cotton gauzes, adhered with glue paste.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There remained the issue of bonding the new transfer canvas
                  itself. In the traditional French style technique, the
                  painting is adhered with glue paste to its new canvas, then it
                  is ironed through the facing; this technique provides very
                  good improvement of the surface condition and good flattening
                  of the lifting paint. Nevertheless, it is a delicate
                  procedure, one which requires a high degree of mastery of the
                  technique. As the surface condition was now satisfactory, we
                  considered that such an operation was not necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From that point, we shifted to a synthetic type of bonding. We
                  glued a nonwoven polyester fabric layer onto the cotton gauzes
                  with diluted Plextol&nbsp;B500; this thin, fast-drying layer is
                  meant to isolate the reverse from the greater amount of
                  moisture used during the lining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On another working strainer we stretched a linen-polyester
                  lining canvas, which combines the strength and tension of
                  linen with inertia and relative stability of polyester to
                  moisture variations. It was adhered to the reverse of the
                  painting using a mixture of equal parts Plextol B500 and
                  Tylose MH-300 (methylcellulose) at 6% (<a href="#fig-35-6"><strong>fig. 35.6</strong></a>). After the lining, the protective facing layers were
                  removed, and the painting was stretched on a new stretcher.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As you can see, this restoration proved to be complex. We
                  constantly had to balance the advantages and disadvantages of
                  the several techniques available to us, and there was never a
                  straightforward answer. The traditional French technique,
                  using glue paste, did not ensure the consolidation of the
                  ground layer, nor a long-lasting bond, due to the ground’s
                  powdery surface. The traditional lining process would have
                  involved sustained moistening of the stratigraphy, and this
                  would have inevitably led to a reappearance of deformations,
                  which ironing could not have effectively reduced, as the chalk
                  priming reacts primarily to humidity and not to heat. The
                  tradition technique would therefore have been a risk with no
                  apparent benefit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, while synthetic materials offered the
                  benefit of good consolidation and adhesion they did not have
                  the rigidity of glue paste, and they did not intrinsically
                  contribute to the surface flattening. Moreover, they would
                  have provided elasticity to a painting that did not have any
                  and caused the appearance of new cracking on this painting,
                  which is stiff by nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painting is now consolidated and lined; the deformations
                  and roof-shape lifting have been reduced and no longer impede
                  its legibility. The structure keeps a certain stiffness, which
                  respects the thick chalk ground layer (<a href="#fig-35-7"><strong>fig. 35.7</strong></a>). Moreover, the synthetic materials on the outer part of the
                  painting somehow form a moisture barrier. It is therefore the
                  deliberate combination of traditional and synthetic methods
                  that made this balanced result possible.
                </p>
                <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  For almost three years, the collection managers of the Musée
                  Girodet in Montargis and the painting department of the C2RMF
                  monitored the conservation work carried out on the paintings
                  damaged by the 2016 flood. The treatment choices were made
                  collectively by the museum collection managers, the C2RMF
                  staff, and the conservators during weekly visits organized in
                  the studios, taking into consideration technical, scientific,
                  and aesthetic issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The work carried out by the six teams of conservators enabled
                  the fifty-one paintings hosted at the C2RMF to regain their
                  physical integrity and their visual appearance so that they
                  can return to the exhibition galleries of the Musée Girodet.
                  The painting conservators specializing in the canvas support
                  worked in collaboration with the painting conservators
                  specializing in the paint layers, who were responsible for
                  carrying out all cleaning and reintegration operations of the
                  paint layers. It was very important to work with several teams
                  of conservators, who had distinct skills and practices. They
                  were able to assess very different and complex problems
                  together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During this campaign, knowledge of the painting techniques,
                  material history, behavior and treatment of the immersed works
                  has greatly improved. Out of a corpus of fifty-one paintings
                  submerged for seventy-two hours, thirty-one of which had
                  already had major structural interventions in the past,
                  thirty-six were relined using traditional, synthetic, or mixed
                  methods. The interventions carried out show that traditional
                  and modern methods of relining are not opposed but complement
                  each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is also crucial that the knowledge of both traditional and
                  modern methods be passed on so that the full range of
                  treatments remain available to conservators in the future. The
                  guiding principle remained finding the best treatment for each
                  painting in this very particular context, while considering
                  the number of paintings that needed to treated at the same
                  time.

                  Remedial conservation aims to arrest the ongoing deterioration
                  process of an art object, but it can create serious problems
                  if it is not executed properly. This was noticed during a
                  conservation project undertaken in a government museum in
                  India’s state Rajasthan. This paper endeavors discuss the
                  issue and describe the challenges faced during the

                  In November 2017, the Government Museum of Rajasthan
                  approached Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA)
                  about the documentation and conservation of its collection in
                  the Government Museum Alwar. This museum was established in
                  1940 in the city palace of Alwar and is spread over three
                  halls. However, the collection of museums is displayed in four
                  galleries. The first gallery contains sculptures and
                  inscriptions; the second gallery contains musical instruments,
                  a natural history collection, and decorative items. The third
                  gallery houses the unique collection of canvas paintings and
                  manuscripts, and the fourth gallery is dedicated to arms and
                  armor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alwar (a former principality) is a prominent city in the state
                  of Rajasthan and is popularly known as the gateway to
                  Rajasthan. The city is situated 160 kilometers southeast of
                  New Delhi, the capital of India, and is part of the National
                  Capital Region. In ancient times this area was known as Matsya
                  Mahajanpad; it is mentioned in the Buddhist text
                  <em>Anguttar Nikay</em> a as being among sixteen
                  <em>MahaJanpad</em>. Bairath (present Viratnagar) was the
                  capital of Matsya Desh (<a href="#fig-36-1"><strong>fig. 36.1</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Alwar museum is known for its unique, varied collection;
                  it houses around fourteen thousand objects, including
                  textiles, miniatures, rare books, canvas paintings, wooden
                  objects, furniture, a natural history collection, metalwork,
                  arms and armor, decorative art, and terracotta and stone
                  objects. The collection also has twenty-six canvas paintings;
                  twenty-four were on display at the time of our work, while two
                  were kept in storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These paintings are excellent works made locally by artisans
                  under the patronage of the Alwar maharajas. The founder of the
                  kingdom didn’t have time to concentrate on arts and crafts,
                  but his successors gave patronage to Dalchand, Baldev, and
                  Saligram. Although Dalchand and Saligram came from Jaipur,
                  they started the Alwar school of paintings in eighteenth
                  century. This school was developed from Jaipur school of
                  paintings and had a Mughal influence. Dalchand had worked in
                  the Rajput style, and Baldev was expert in the Mughal school,
                  so the amalgamation of these two styles gradually came to be
                  known as Alwar school of paintings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Maharaja Viney Singh was the greatest art enthusiast in the
                  Alwar royal family tree and was himself a painter,
                  calligrapher, and binder. During his time, Aga Mirza Khan was
                  also a great calligrapher. Similarly, Natha Khan Darvesh and
                  Abdul Rehman were expert in making figures and designs at the
                  border of paintings. The paintings displayed at the Alwar
                  museum were made during the reign of Maharaja Viney Singh
                  (1815–1857) and have great historical significance (<a href="#fig-36-2"><strong>fig. 36.2</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Museum is located in what was once the Maharaja’s palace,
                  which was converted for the task. Three large halls on the
                  upper floor are dedicated to the display of objects. The
                  canvas paintings that are the subject of this paper are
                  displayed in gallery 3. The building has had various problems
                  that arose since it was repurposed into a museum. Weather
                  extremes and the overall condition of the building did not
                  provide a suitable environment for the collection. For
                  example, broken glass in a large window let biological agents
                  into the galleries, and those agents’ activity caused problems
                  that were noticed on the paintings during the documentation.
                  Gaps between the walls and paintings had provided habitat for
                  bats and other pests, and as a result the paintings had
                  suffered paint losses and the disintegration of canvas due to
                  bat excreta and other biological activity. The museum also had
                  problems with leaks, leading to dampness on walls. This
                  resulted in fungal infestations on the paintings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, paintings were exposed to many agents of
                  deterioration: climatic conditions, negligence, and poor
                  storage, as well as previous interventions. It was noticed
                  that all the paintings had been treated in the past. Also, the
                  materials and methodology used in the treatment showed that
                  all the paintings had been conserved by a single person and
                  within the same timeframe. However, no conservation records
                  could be found from the host institution.
                </p>
                <p>The following problems were noticed on the paintings:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Bulging. The painting was lined without flattening. The
                      unflattened area resulted in bulges, and this transferred
                      to the paint layer.

                <p>
                  It is impossible to undertake a satisfactory and ethical
                  treatment without a good conservation plan. Conservation
                  planning requires a thorough understanding of material and
                  technique, and of the causes of deterioration in order to
                  ethically conserve the artworks. Our conservation plan
                  included the following phases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>

                      <strong>Documentation.</strong> This is the method of
                      understanding the cause of problems and determining the
                      materials and techniques used in an artwork.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Deterioration.</strong> It is necessary to
                      determine the nature of any deterioration, its cause, and
                      the extent of damage for remedial conservation.

                      <strong>Treatment/remedial conservation.</strong> This is
                      where satisfactory treatment is determined and applied
                      based on the information derived from previous phases. In
                      this phase it is vital to keep in mind the principles of
                      minimum intervention, compatibility, and reversibility.

                  Museum administration asked us to undertake the work only in
                  the museum. We were assigned space in gallery 3, which was
                  converted into a temporary in&nbsp;situ studio (<a href="#fig-36-3"><strong>fig. 36.3</strong></a>). This was an open studio, where visitors were allowed to
                  interact and ask questions about the ongoing activities. The
                  museum collection is public property; therefore, it is the
                  public’s right to know what is happening to these collections.
                  Keeping this in mind, we entertained any interested visitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In formulating our conservation plan, we carried out a
                  thorough initial study to understand the reasons behind the
                  problems and study the techniques and art-historical aspects
                  of the paintings. Examinations done with visible, raking,
                  transmitted, and ultraviolet light sources were used to
                  retrieve information from the objects. Overpainted areas
                  (hidden beneath the surface) were revealed with UV light and
                  documented.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the documentation phase we could definitively state that
                  all the paintings had been treated in the past. In principle,
                  whatever material is being used for a given conservation
                  treatment should be reversible and compatible with the
                  artworks. This approach was not applied in previous
                  treatments, which meant that these treatments become one of
                  the causes of deterioration. Past treatments included
                  cleaning, patch mending lining, filling, in-painting, and
                  varnishing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After finishing our detailed study, we decided on the
                  following steps for treating the paintings:
                </p>

                  Problems Due to Past Treatments and Their Subsequent Remedies
                </h2>
                <h3 id="patch-mending" tabindex="-1">Patch Mending</h3>
                <p>
                  Patches were found in abundance on almost all the paintings.
                  Three phases of patch mending were found: one on the original
                  support, one on the lining canvas, and sometimes a third patch
                  on the patch applied to the lining canvas. The material of the
                  patch was cotton, but in some cases electrical tape and paper
                  were also used for mending purposes (<a href="#fig-36-4"><strong>fig. 36.4</strong></a>), and these were applied without removing older patches. The
                  mending itself caused problems in some paintings. The
                  dimension of each patch was larger than the tear it addressed,
                  and the density of cloth greater than that of the original
                  canvas, causing these patches to be clearly visible on the
                  image layer and leading to problems in the paint layer (<a href="#fig-36-5"><strong>fig. 36.5</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our approach involved first carefully removing all the patches
                  and cleaning off the adhesive properly, using acetone. This
                  was easy, as the used adhesive had become brittle and lost
                  adhesion. Then a thin film of Beva 371 was laid onto fine
                  muslin cloth; after drying this film was used for mending.
                  Tears were aligned properly, and the film was then applied
                  with the help of heat and pressure. The thickness of the
                  applied film was less than that of the original canvas, so
                  this treatment should not create any problems in the future.
                  If the mend shows some irregularity, it can easily be removed
                  without damaging original artwork.

                <h3 id="lining" tabindex="-1">Lining</h3>
                <p>
                  All but three paintings were lined. Two kinds of glue (glue
                  paste and wax resin) had been used as an adhesive for lining
                  purposes. Necessary precautions had not been taken while
                  lining the painting in the past and, as a result, air was
                  trapped between the original and lining canvases. This led to
                  a separation of the lining canvas from the original and caused
                  other structural problems with the paintings, including local
                  detachment, opening of lining, and other surface problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lining is a major intervention to an artwork. It may alter the
                  appearance of the painting, for example, color change,
                  flattening of impasto, and impregnation of the painting with
                  the lining adhesive. These risks are the reasons that lining
                  is considered a maximum intervention and should be practiced
                  only as a last remedy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following problems were noticed in the previously lined
                  paintings:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Air pockets between original canvas and lining canvas</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Presence of foreign material between original and lining
                      canvases
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Lining executed without flattening of canvas</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  These issues led to delining, bulging, and loss of paint
                  layer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After removing the linings, we found that the original canvas
                  was stable, although tear and holes were evident. Seeing the
                  condition of the canvas, we decided not to line the majority
                  of the paintings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because the paintings were at serious risk and all required
                  structural treatment to stop the ongoing deterioration
                  process, we began by removing them from their
                  stretchers/strainers and then removing the lining canvas. At
                  that point we found that most of the original canvases were in
                  sound condition, except for three where the canvas had
                  deteriorated and was no longer able to support the weight of
                  the image layer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The principle of minimum intervention was followed for the
                  paintings in which the canvas was found in good condition.
                  Most these paintings did not have the fold-over edge; it is
                  possible those edges had been removed to trim the paintings.
                  Strip-lining was decided on for these paintings where the
                  canvas was in stable condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In some paintings the original canvas was folded over the
                  stretcher. We decided to reveal the folded canvas in these
                  cases, increasing the size of painting. However, the curator
                  resisted this idea because it would create a discrepancy in
                  museum documentation. We explained to the curator that for
                  ethical reasons the original paint layer should be revealed.
                  Finally, the new size was accepted by the museum, which
                  justified its decision on the grounds that during the
                  conservation treatment the original paint layer was revealed
                  to have larger dimensions than those previously recorded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As mentioned, three paintings needed to be lined, as the
                  original canvases were not in good enough condition to hold
                  the image layer. A lack of equipment made lining on site
                  difficult. Nonetheless, we lined the paintings on a makeshift
                  suction table using vacuum pressure (<a href="#fig-36-6"><strong>fig. 36.6</strong></a>). The adhesive used for lining was Beva 371. Lining was
                  carried out in a vacuum envelope, and the heat was applied
                  using an iron.

                <h2 id="cleaning" tabindex="-1">Cleaning</h2>
                <p>
                  Cleaning means removal of all the material that is adhered on
                  the paint surface and whatever appears on the surface due to
                  degradation. The details of the paintings had become obscured
                  due to darkened varnish and dust and dirt accumulated on the
                  surface. Changes to the color of the paintings also caused
                  them to lose their three-dimensional effect. The paintings had
                  dust and dirt, stains, paint splashes, and oxidized varnish on
                  the surface. In addition, biological activity was noticed on
                  the painting’s surface as well as on the verso. Therefore, it
                  was important to clean the surface both to reveal the image
                  and to stop the further decay of the artworks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We considered a series of questions before starting the
                  cleaning process. This exercise assures the integrity of the
                  artwork and the ethical approach to cleaning the painting’s
                  surface. We considered the following cleaning-related issues:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>What is foreign material?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Is it dirt?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Is it damaging? If yes, what will be the extent of
                      cleaning?
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Is cleaning necessary?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Can the painting take the cleaning process?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>What will be the effect of cleaning?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>What will be the object’s appearance after cleaning?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Will the stability of the object be affected?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>How can you clean the object?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Is there a suitable treatment?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>How does the treatment work?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Is the treatment safe for both the object and us?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>At what point should we stop?</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  After assessing these questions and their consequences, the
                  cleaning was carried out. After discussion with curator, it
                  was decided to fully clean the paintings. The cleaning was
                  done to address the dust and dirt and to remove
                  yellowed/darkened varnish, overpaint, and other foreign
                  material from the surface. Tests were carried out on small
                  areas using solvents of increasing strength—starting with
                  saliva and progressing through alcohol to ketones to a
                  solution of aliphatic solvents and finally to a solution of
                  aromatic solvents—to find a solvent that could remove the
                  varnish/overpaint and other unwanted material from the surface
                  without harming the original paint film. Once the solvent was
                  determined, a cleaning safety margin test was carried out with
                  selected solvent to ensure it would not affect the stability
                  of the colors present in the painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The aromatic solvents gave fantastic results, but the same
                  result was achieved with polar solvents by increasing the
                  reaction time. Hence, the varnish removal was done using
                  acetone and isopropyl alcohol (<a href="#fig-36-7"><strong>fig. 36.7</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <h2 id="consolidation" tabindex="-1">Consolidation</h2>
                <p>
                  The term <em>consolidation</em> is used to describe providing
                  adhesion between loose layers of a painting that are separated
                  from the ground. Generally, this is done to stabilize problems
                  like flaking, cupping, powdering, and blisters. Consolidation
                  can be executed from the back (maximum intervention) or on the
                  front, only to affected areas (local application). Preference
                  was given to local consolidation in line with the principle of
                  minimum intervention. Beva 371 was applied on affected areas
                  using a small brush and later settled with a hot spatula (<a href="#fig-36-8"><strong>fig. 36.8</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <h2 id="restretching" tabindex="-1">Restretching</h2>
                <p>
                  After completion of the structural work, the paintings were
                  restretched. A strip of Tyvek was added at the tacking margin
                  to avoid direct contact between nails and the original
                  support. Loose-lining (also with Tyvek) was provided to give
                  extra strength to the original canvas. This was done from the
                  back to protect the painting from moisture, dust, and dirt,
                  and to prevent future biological activity happening behind the
                  canvas. Except for the paintings that were restored to their
                  earlier dimensions, the same stretchers/strainers were used
                  for restretching the paintings after stabilization.
                </p>

                  Filling and Texturing
                </h2>
                <p>
                  It was necessary to reintegrate lacunae after restretching the
                  paintings. It was important to fill the gaps to restore
                  continuity and aesthetics in the image layer. Various methods
                  are used for filling on canvas paintings. We used a
                  traditional method of filling with a mixture of French chalk,
                  kaolin, pigment, and PVA emulsion. This material was used to
                  fill the lacunae using brush and spatula. Fills required
                  texturing similar to the surrounding area. Inpainting without
                  texturing does not match and looks out of place.
                </p>
                <h2 id="retouching" tabindex="-1">Retouching</h2>
                <p>
                  <em>Retouching</em> originally meant corrections or changes
                  made by an artist as final adjustments to his or her own
                  artwork. Nowadays retouching is sometimes considered to be
                  synonymous with inpainting. To us, retouching means the last
                  step of painting conservation—one that is required to please
                  museum visitors and to accurately reflect the artist’s
                  original intentions. This is normally at least a two-step
                  process. It is necessary to conserve the painting to stabilize
                  it and stop the ongoing deterioration process, but a painting
                  can survive without retouching for a longer time. However,
                  ground color correction is required for aesthetic reasons, to
                  allow the painting to be appreciated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The retouching was carried out using pigment and Paraloid B72
                  as a medium. Before any retouching was done, a layer of
                  Paraloid B72 was applied to the fill areas to ensure the
                  reversibility of the retouching.
                </p>
                <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  After the remedial conservation the paintings were well
                  stabilized and could once again be appreciated by visitors.
                  The colors that had been hidden by dark varnish are now
                  visible. The ongoing structural problems of the paintings have
                  been stabilized, and there are no longer unstable areas that
                  will lead to further deterioration.

                  During this project, we also trained the museum staff,
                  students, and conservation professionals of that region
                  through workshops. The workshop titled Conservation and
                  Documentation of Oil Paintings was conducted in collaboration
                  with SRAL, in the Netherlands, under the leadership of Kate
                  Seymour. The painting conservation project was completed in
                  eighteen months’ time. In addition to the paintings, the
                  museum got a new look through a complete renovation, and
                  conservation of the entire collection was done as well,
                  including documentation. The paintings we restored are now
                  displayed in the same location and can be viewed in a far
                  better state and appreciated newly (<a href="#fig-36-9"><strong>fig. 36.9</strong></a>).

                  The paper discusses novel approaches and targeted structural
                  treatments of paintings on canvas made possible by a precision
                  temperature management methodology for mild heat transfer
                  based on flexible mats. Flexible silicone mats and carbon
                  nanotube–enabled IMAT prototypes and the associated mobile MAT
                  and IMAT electronic temperature management consoles were
                  designed specifically for the field to offer accuracy and
                  mobility for new smart approaches to conserving paintings on
                  canvas, setting new standards in precision, steadiness,
                  uniformity, and control in mild heat transfer. The varied
                  dimensions of mats and their thin, flexible profile, combined
                  with accuracy in the low-energy range, allow conservators to
                  formulate novel “low and slow” targeted treatments that
                  exploit the effects of well-controlled, precision low-energy
                  heat transfer over time on previously treated/lined paintings.
                  Even more critically for unlined and extremely fragile modern
                  or contemporary works, this methodology allows them to be
                  treated without removing them from their stretchers or
                  exposing them to unnecessary stress and the uncontrolled
                  high-heat-transfer risks of the past.

                <p>
                  Conservation treatment methodologies have historically
                  exploited heat as an essential factor for the effective
                  remediation of structural damage in paintings on canvas.
                  However, past interventions were not without considerable
                  risk, since heat was applied with rudimentary tools that
                  provided quite limited control over the set temperature, the
                  steadiness of delivery, and uniformity of distribution over
                  the treatment surface area, leading to highly undesirable
                  results ranging from incomplete treatments to irreversible
                  changes in surface morphology of the paint and ground layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the 1974 Greenwich Conference on Comparative Lining
                  Techniques, concerns over the effects of excessive heat during
                  lining processes were raised, and this contributed to the
                  overall conclusion that treatments should adhere to goals of
                  minimal intervention and reversibility. The then-new “cold
                  lining” methodologies were seen as an alternative to
                  heat-driven methods with poorly managed or uncontrolled—and
                  therefore damaging temperature ranges, and the call for a
                  moratorium on lining in 1975 was a result of the
                  dissatisfaction with the status quo in treatment outcomes
                  ([[Percival-Prescott 2003a]]). In response to those monitions,
                  conservators have since sought to limit or eliminate&nbsp;the
                  application of heat, humidity, and pressure (which they could
                  not control well due to limited technical means) in order to
                  minimize the harmful impact of structural treatments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Precise and well-controlled heat, humidity, pressure, and
                  associated time factors, however, do not have equally
                  effective alternatives in structural treatments due to the
                  inherent viscoelastic nature of painting materials: paint,
                  ground, canvas support. Without the option of exploiting the
                  physical factors of heat, humidity, and pressure, treatment
                  choices become extremely limited. Control over time,
                  temperature, and humidity allows the manipulation of Young’s
                  modulus to temporarily plasticize the painting materials
                  during the treatment and shift their physical properties
                  toward&nbsp;the “safe zone” of viscoelastic dynamics, which is
                  essential for both effective treatment and minimal risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This aspect has always been intuitively understood by
                  practitioners, who continue to use hand irons and ad hoc
                  heating setups, such as hot-water bladders, heat guns, and
                  similar tools designed for household use, despite their lack
                  of precise, safe control of the temperature and heat transfer.
                  In fact, the real issue has always been not the heat,
                  moisture, or pressure but the extremely poor control over
                  these physical factors, in particular fluctuating and
                  excessively high temperatures, which exacerbate the effects of
                  moisture and pressure, and which were the main source of
                  stress on constituent painting materials in structural
                  treatments in the past.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The 2019 Conserving Canvas Symposium affirmed the field’s
                  paradigm shift away from lining to a broader consideration of
                  multiple material and intangible authenticity aspects and
                  targeted structural treatment of traditional and unlined
                  modern and contemporary paintings, as well as the challenges
                  of the expanding types of new media used in twentieth and
                  twenty-first century paintings on canvas. Since Greenwich, the
                  approach of minimal intervention has fully matured in the
                  field as a principal guiding ethos, yet technological
                  advancements in heat transfer instrumentation and
                  temperature-based methodology have lagged, leaving
                  conservators without an essential temperature management
                  technology to bridge theory and bench practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An innovative approach that aims to overcome this gap involves
                  a new low-temperature-optimized treatment methodology that
                  employs flexible low-energy silicone-clad heating mats and
                  associated precision temperature-management technology.
                  Research, experimentation, and treatments have been conducted
                  by the authors using the low-energy heating mats since 2003,
                  and the design features of the technology have evolved to
                  permit conservators to precisely apply heat, in particular in
                  a low temperature range—from ambient temperatures to those
                  customarily used for adhesive activation (25ºC–65ºC)— for
                  localized and targeted methodologies to allow for minimal
                  treatments to address the expanding needs in the laboratory
                  ([[Olsson and Markevičius 2017]]). In particular, gaining
                  control over steady, accurate heat transfer in the low-energy
                  and temperature range (21ºC–40ºC) over an extended time period
                  is the essential novelty of the new “low-and-slow” approach,
                  an option that was previously inaccessible due to
                  technological limitations.

                  Heat Transfer in Conservation of Paintings on Canvas: History,
                  Approaches, and Lessons from the Past
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The examination of paintings on canvas with prior lining
                  treatments often involves identification of visual evidence of
                  unwanted alterations that can be attributed to the effects of
                  uncontrolled heat that exceeded the required or safe
                  temperatures and were combined with equally uncontrolled and
                  unsafe levels of humidity and wetting, all of which together
                  caused irreversible changes in canvas and paint surface
                  morphology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The execution of traditional flour-paste or wax-resin linings
                  requires elevated and sustained heat transfer. Historically,
                  it was performed with thermally uncontrolled methods such as
                  hot sand or water bags, flat irons, or self-heating box irons,
                  which relied on the reliner to monitor and regulate the
                  temperature by touch. The introduction of electric irons in
                  the early twentieth century led to their adoption for relining
                  treatments, and they continue to be among methods employed to
                  the present day ([[Bomford et al. 2003|, 31]]). Most electric
                  hand irons used by conservators today are not precision tools:
                  they lack steadiness in heat transfer, as they are regulated
                  by thermostatic on-off mechanisms that deliver only an average
                  set temperature, which in actuality is a fluctuating series of
                  over- and undershoots that trigger the on-off function.
                  Variance as high as ±15^o^ C has been observed on hand irons
                  ([<strong>fig. 37.1</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/38-Olsson/fig-37-1)).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This lack of steadiness is even more problematic when the
                  conservator attempts to heat a larger area with sweeping
                  movement of the iron, which necessitates the set temperature
                  to be considerably higher than the desired surface
                  temperature. Furthermore, most hand irons are designed for
                  household textiles, and therefore have operational parameters
                  between 120ºC and 180ºC, far above the safe, low-energy range
                  needed for painting materials. Other temperature controls,
                  such as rheostats, measure energy output and are not corrected
                  by local temperature readings, so the actual surface
                  temperature is unknown.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The primacy of lining as the most significant structural
                  remediation method motivated conservators in the mid-to-late
                  twentieth century to develop custom-fabricated hot tables to
                  overcome the difficulties of heating a larger surface area
                  than possible with a hand iron. The earliest of these were
                  guided by the desire to improve impregnation at 65ºC or higher
                  when performing the prevailing method of wax-resin lining
                  ([[Ruhemann 1953|, 73]]; {P{lenderleith 1956|, 169]];
                  [[Bomford 2003]]; [[Rees Jones, Cummings, and Hedley 2003]];
                  [[Berger and Zeliger 2003|, v–ix]]; [[Ackroyd 2002]]; [[Falvey
                  2008]]). Refinements were made to the design of multipurpose
                  heating tables from the 1980s on, to be used in combination
                  with thermoplastic synthetic adhesives for linings that are
                  activated at 65ºC. Nonetheless, many heating tables lack
                  uniformity in heat transfer over the table surface area, which
                  is easily identified by thermal imaging cameras, and users
                  come to know the idiosyncratic hot and cold spots present on
                  their device ([[Olsson and Markevičius 2010]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the 1970s to the 1990s, various low-pressure envelope
                  methods were combined with infrared lamps for heat transfer
                  ([[Hedley, Hackney, and Cummings 2003]])—or even heat
                  guns—with the inevitable obstacles to accuracy and control,
                  although these methods also aimed to achieve the customary
                  65ºC heat-activation temperatures for synthetic thermoplastic
                  consolidating and lining adhesives. These large, costly
                  devices do not resonate with the fundamental shift in
                  conservation methodology to prioritize targeted, minimally
                  invasive treatments, today performed by conservators rather
                  than specialized reliners. The application of heat transfer
                  expanded to localized remedial treatments, such as tear
                  mending, consolidation, stabilization of cracked and lifted
                  paint, and reduction of diverse deformations and planar
                  distortions. In the absence of alternatives, these treatments
                  are performed with spatulas and tacking and hand irons
                  ([[Olsson and Markevičius 2010]]).

                  Paintings on Canvas as Viscoelastic Systems: The Role of
                  Temperature
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The risks and beneficial effects of heat transfer in
                  conservation treatments must be assessed within a
                  comprehensive understanding of the nature of paintings and
                  painting as physical systems. This understanding is crucial to
                  evaluating paintings’ materials, condition, potential response
                  to treatment, and the long-term sustainability and stability
                  of the intervention—and to formulating treatment protocols. In
                  1991, Mecklenburg published experimental data indicating that
                  artist paints are viscoelastic systems ([[Mecklenburg and
                  Tumosa 1991b]]). The viscoelastic behavior of paintings has
                  been investigated in the context of their cleaning and
                  mechanical properties ([[Hedley and Odlyha 1989]]; [[Michalski
                  1991]]; [[Hagen et al. 2007]]; [[Hagen 2017]]; [[Phenix
                  2011]]), and the effects of temperature and humidity have been
                  investigated in the contexts of art transportation and
                  preventive conservation. However, the effects of temperature
                  and viscoelastic behavior have been investigated less in the
                  context of structural treatments of paintings on canvas. These
                  aspects were addressed by Berger and others ([[Russell and
                  Berger 1982]]; [[Berger and Russell 1984]], [[Berger and
                  Russell 1986]]; [[Berger and Russell 1988]]; ([[Goddard
                  1989]]); [[Olsson and Markevičius 2010]]; [[Markevičius et al.
                  2013]]; [[Olsson and Markevičius 2017]]; [[Markevičius et al.
                  2017]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once fully dry, paint films behave as elastic, viscoelastic,
                  or viscoplastic materials, depending on the chemical nature of
                  their components. With aging variations in the pigments used,
                  oil films acquire a greater degree of cross-linking and
                  stiffness, with a corresponding rise in glass transition
                  temperature (Tg) from ambient temperature (0ºC–50ºC) to as
                  high as 75ºC–100ºC for paints containing lead white ([[Phenix
                  2011]]). Glass transition temperatures of acrylic, alkyd, and
                  oil primers were found to be in the range of 21ºC–44ºC
                  ([[Hagan et al. 2007]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In structural conservation treatments of paintings on canvas,
                  the constituent viscoelastic materials, such as paint films,
                  may suffer structural failure caused by the rapid application
                  of force while in the stiff, glassy state. However, it is
                  possible to shift from a strain causing failure to one
                  avoiding failure by temporarily rendering the viscoelastic
                  material more plastic (enabling it to adapt to the required
                  rate of deformation) in various ways: by adding moisture or
                  other agent that acts as a plasticizer or increasing the
                  amount of energy in the system, that is, raising the
                  temperature. The relationship of stress and strain (Young’s
                  modulus) is influenced by plasticizers, such as water
                  (humidity treatments) and thermal energy (expressed in
                  temperature). By tailoring the introduction of thermal energy
                  to the required rate of deformation of the material during
                  treatment, the stiffness of the system may be temporarily
                  reduced, allowing planar distortions to be manipulated in the
                  more malleable state. Optimal control of heat energy transfer
                  is therefore paramount, as beneficial heat effects cannot be

                  Development and Functionality of a Flexible Mat System
                </h3>
                <p>
                  As previously discussed, the heat transfer instrumentation
                  used historically and currently available lacks accuracy in
                  the low-temperature range, as well as steadiness and
                  uniformity, and this deficit limits options and treatment
                  approaches. The surface areas of heat-transfer instruments are
                  limited to the small size of spatula heads, tacking irons,
                  hand irons, and extra-large heating tables, with no
                  alternatives in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In response to the omissions and gaps in currently available
                  instrumentation, a precision heat-transfer technology in the
                  form of flexible silicone-clad heating mats and associated
                  temperature control consoles was developed specifically for
                  art conservation applications. The mats provide the
                  conservator with novel control in the low-energy range
                  (ambient to 40ºC) making prolonged heat transfer possible and
                  allowing implementation of a low-and-slow approach&nbsp;that
                  permits conservators to gain control over the heat transfer
                  and innovate safe, nuanced treatments of both lined and
                  unlined paintings. The mats are designed to deliver heat at
                  the temperatures slightly above those customarily used to
                  activate thermoplastic adhesives (to 70ºC) and they provide
                  access the low-energy range below 40ºC, which was previously
                  inaccessible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the novel treatment methodology, heating mat systems were
                  designed to provide an accurate, versatile, mobile low-energy
                  heat transfer technology. All are based on three key
                  components: the heating mat, the thermocouple (TC), and the
                  temperature control console ([<strong>fig. 37.2</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/38-Olsson/fig-37-2)).
                  The heating mat is the thermal output surface. The mats are
                  laminates composed of resistive elements embedded within an
                  exterior cladding of vulcanized silicone. In 2010, the authors
                  first proposed using carbon nanotubes (CNT) for precision
                  low-energy heat transfer ([[Markevičius et al. 2011]]). The
                  resulting heating mats are very flexible, with a nontack
                  surface and thin profile that can be inserted between the wood
                  strainer and canvas verso for treatment of a painting in situ
                  on the stretcher.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The thermocouple is the sensor used to measure the actual
                  temperature at its tip, which provides feedback to the
                  temperature controller. The&nbsp;TC (type T) is made of two
                  metallic wires that conduct heat, copper, and constantan
                  (nickel-copper alloy), which are joined at one end. The type-T
                  thermocouple has a sensitivity of 43 µV/°C and is accurate to
                  0.5°C. It was selected for its temperature range, high degree
                  of reliability, and accuracy. The TC is positioned in direct
                  contact with the heating mat surface, or it can be placed
                  strategically on any surface, as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The control console is a unit composed of a PID
                  (proportional-integral-derivative) temperature controller,
                  which employs a control loop mechanism to continuously
                  calculate an error value as the difference between the desired
                  setpoint temperature and a measured process variable and
                  applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and
                  derivative terms. Depending on the PID controller, the
                  temperature feedback loop may be corrected between four and
                  forty times per second, resulting in ultra-steady heating
                  patterns ([<strong>fig. 37.3</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/38-Olsson/fig-37-3)).

                  The first prototype heater was adopted from existing
                  industrial technology in 2003 and manufactured for use in the
                  lining treatment of two large-format New Deal murals by Howard
                  S. Sewell in Oregon City, Oregon. The silicone heating mat was
                  made with wound copper and fiberglass resistance wire elements
                  plotted in a dense linear pattern at 1/4 inch intervals. It
                  was custom made to accommodate the height of the murals. The
                  relining process also employed a Dartek vacuum envelope with
                  two outflowing points connected to a Gast vacuum pump. The
                  mural sections were bonded with a Beva interleaf to the
                  backing by heating them in sections, positioning the
                  thermocouple between the heating mat and the backing surface.
                  The portability of the mat allowed all of the work to be
                  conducted on site ([[Olsson and Markevicius 2010]]).

                <p>
                  In 2010, the authors first proposed using carbon nanotubes for
                  precision heat transfer in art conservation ([[Markevicius et
                  al. 2011]]). From 2011 to 2014, the European Commission’s IMAT
                  Project (Intelligent Mobile Multipurpose Accurate
                  Thermo-Electrical Device<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>), coordinated by the University of Florence,&nbsp;considerably
                  refined the design of flexible heating laminates for art
                  conservation. The IMAT mats were created with innovative
                  e-textiles woven with integrated yarns coated with carbon
                  nanotubes (CNT), as heating elements. Various prototypes were
                  developed, including a transparent mat and a breathable
                  version that allowed for permeability when humidity was used
                  during treatment. The significant advantages of using CNTs lie
                  in their ultra-low mass and extremely high electrical and
                  thermal conductivity, which allows rapid thermal response
                  (essential for accuracy) and safe, ultra-low voltage (36V),
                  The project final deliverable was proof-of-concept IMAT
                  prototypes, which continue to be used for diverse conservation
                  and research projects. As of this writing, it is awaiting
                  further investment for upscaling and production for the use in

                  In order to advance research and treatment methodologies of
                  precision heat transfer, available wound wire technology has
                  also been employed in the design of a series of silicone

                <p>
                  In practice, remedial treatment to reduce planar distortions,
                  such as cupped paint and surface deformations of the paint,
                  ground, and canvas layers, may be conducted by exploiting
                  their viscoelastic properties with controlled increase in
                  temperature to cause the paint film to transition from a
                  glassy state to a pliable state, when pressure may be applied
                  safely and effectively. The transition temperature may be
                  reduced by introduction of a temporary plasticizer, such as
                  humidity or heat energy. Accuracy is critical for safe and
                  effective heat treatment, in order to maintain a steady set
                  temperature for the duration of treatment within the Tg range
                  and achieve the transition to a compliant state while avoiding
                  undesirable overheating of the paint surface. Thick or aged
                  films may require a longer period of heat transfer to achieve
                  the even warming throughout the entire painting stratigraphy.
                  With aging and given variations from the effects of pigments,
                  oil films acquire a higher degree of cross-linking and
                  stiffness with a corresponding rise in Tg from ambient
                  temperature (0ºC–50ºC) to as high as 75ºC–100ºC for paints
                  containing lead white ([[Phenix 2011]]). Therefore, in many
                  instances the ideal operational temperature will be in the low
                  or ambient temperature range, and in some cases even a small
                  viscoelastic response can be significant.

                  Our first example is John E. Stuart’s
                  <em>Mt. St. Helens from a Hill Back of Portland</em>
                  (1885).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  Planar distortions from cracks and severe cupping had formed
                  in extremely brittle paint and ground layers, and the tacking
                  edges were degraded at the return edge. The scope of
                  structural treatment was to stabilize cracks, reduce or
                  eliminate planar distortions, and reinforce the tacking edges
                  with a strip lining. Lascaux P550 (20% in naphtha) was
                  introduced into the cracks from the recto in an area with
                  particularly unstable paint and ground cracks. Following full
                  evaporation of the solvent, localized humidification with a
                  small chamber preceded application of localized mild heat
                  transfer at 30ºC for forty minutes, which produced a pliable
                  state, allowing mild pressure to be used for consolidation
                  ([<strong>fig. 37.4</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/38-Olsson/fig-37-4)).

                <p>
                  Once unstable areas were treated, the painting was removed
                  from the stretcher for a general structural treatment. The
                  same P550 resin was applied to the reverse and allowed to dry.
                  The verso was then lightly humidified for thirty minutes using
                  a moistened blotter with an interleaf of Polartec microporous
                  membrane. A custom cut-platform of museum board and 1/2 inch
                  foam core was created to support the fragile tacking edges.
                  The painting was then placed in a low-pressure envelope and
                  warmed to 40ºC for forty minutes ([<strong>fig. 37.5</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/38-Olsson/fig-37-5)).
                  The museum board was replaced after twenty minutes to capture
                  introduced moisture. Finally, strip-lining supports of
                  crepeline were prepared with Beva Film prior to bonding them
                  to the tacking edges using an angled support to prevent
                  flattening of the fold edge during adhesion.

                  remedial treatment while the painting remained on the
                  stretcher. Prior to thread-by-thread mending, the flap edges
                  were temporarily joined with tape bridges. Localized
                  humidification of the verso was followed by mild heat transfer
                  at 40˚C for twenty minutes; this was also done at dent sites
                  and in buckled corners. Following the tear repair,
                  humidification and mild heat transfer were again used to
                  achieve planarity of the tear site ([<strong>fig. 37.6</strong>](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/38-Olsson/fig-37-6)).

                  Wax-resin adhesive was widely used for structural treatments
                  until the 1974 Greenwich conference and continued after. When
                  paintings with this treatment history require consolidation or
                  treatment of planar deformations treatment, intervention is
                  problematic without an accurate mild heat source, due to the
                  thermal sensitivity and melting behavior of crystalline waxes,
                  where the safe treatment temperature range is just above room
                  temperature (~20°C) and the critical upper limit is 40ºC or
                  less. The lack of adequate low-temperature devices has led to
                  invasive treatments to reverse the wax-resin linings.

                <p>
                  Testing of mild heat transfer on wax-treated paintings is
                  nascent and has been limited to simulated treatments
                  ([[Markevičius et al. 2017]]). The preliminary results
                  indicate that gradual mild heat transfer over an extended
                  period of time allows safe and efficient treatment of
                  deformations and dents and reactivation of wax-based
                  adhesives.

                  dent in the center of the composition, and two areas of
                  surface distortions in the lower corners. The work had been

                  A thin profile mat was introduced between the wood stretcher
                  and the canvas verso and heated to 40˚C for ten minutes to
                  soften the lining adhesive and relax the canvas and paint
                  layers in a safe range for acrylic paint, in this specific
                  case. Based on practical experience, temperatures below 40˚C
                  appear to be relatively safe, but this is not always the case.
                  The range is specific to both the material and treatment, and
                  it needs to be to assessed together with other factors, such
                  as applied pressure, physicochemical characteristics of
                  specific paint, and the amount of moisture used, which is
                  acting as a temporary plasticizer in a complex viscoelastic
                  system ([[Hagan et al. 2015]]).

                  Once softened and smoothed, the deformation sites were cooled

                  from either side. The same procedure was used to smooth the
                  large concave dent in the center ([[Markevicius et al.

                  Silicone mats can be made in large dimensions and conveniently

                  is contained within a vacuum envelope during treatment, heat
                  may be applied in sections, and easily&nbsp;integrated into

                <p>
                  In the aftermath of the 1974 Greenwich conference, and
                  especially since the 1990s, conservators have wrestled with
                  the question of if, when, and how to undertake structural
                  remediation of paintings on canvas, often preferring
                  postponement rather than treatments employing heat and
                  humidity despite the real conservation needs of paintings in
                  their care. After all, conservators are tasked with designing
                  thoughtful treatments that effectively resolve the problem at
                  hand without repeating the errors of the past. It goes without
                  saying that in this pursuit, the creation of new conservation
                  materials and sophisticated instrumentation is of fundamental
                  importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ongoing studies provide a new understanding of the
                  viscoelastic properties of constituent polymer materials in
                  paintings on canvas, and identify behavioral changes caused by
                  external forces such time, heat, and humidity and how these
                  factors may be exploited to shift aged and brittle materials
                  into physical states that allow safe remedial treatment. This
                  new knowledge can be applied by conservators to improve safety
                  and effectiveness of structural treatment outcomes with the
                  proposed methodology using MAT and IMAT heat-transfer
                  technology for low temperature ranges (25ºC–40ºC) and up to
                  those customarily used for thermoplastic adhesive activation
                  (65º).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The new methodology represents a radical shift from low-tech,
                  poorly controlled heating methods to an approach where the
                  heat transfer is targeted, safe, and commensurate with the
                  desired result. While traditional tools such as hand irons
                  threaten to overheat the paint surface and operate at
                  temperatures higher than is safe, the MAT’s precision and even
                  heat diffusion over large areas allows for a novel
                  low-and-slow approach—the use of safe, low temperatures over
                  an extended period of time, tailored to each specific
                  treatment—and provides the means for conservators to address
                  conditions previously considered untreatable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond the temperature control, novel access to sophisticated
                  microporous membranes that enable better control when
                  humidification is used as a plasticizing agent provides
                  conservators with alternatives with which to formulate new
                  structural treatment methodologies of paintings on canvas and
                  more—within the margins of minimal intervention and risk—while
                  achieving the maximum result.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The variety of case studies shows the broad spectrum of
                  application for mild heat transfer technology in structural
                  treatment and beyond, from the use of mild heat over an
                  extended period to treat planar and surface distortions(the
                  low-and-slow approach) to safe treatment of works previously
                  treated with natural and synthetic crystalline waxes to the
                  utility of the thin, flexible profile to reach between canvas
                  and stretcher bars for treatments that conserve the original
                  mounting and structural integrity of the piece. The compact
                  dimensions and portability of the MAT device allow the
                  conservator to easily and simply work in the laboratory or
                  conduct state-of-the-art treatments in the field, advancing
                  best practices in art conservation and treatment of artworks.

                  It is the authors’ hope that further study will deliver better
                  understanding of how to exploit the beneficial effects of
                  low-energy heat transfer applied to structural treatment,
                  while the introduction of precision heating mats and the
                  low-and-slow approach developed and advocated by the authors,
                  as well as numerous collaborators and colleagues who
                  contributed to this research, will make the future treatments
                  on canvas more efficient, sustainable, and safer.

                  Changing priorities about the structural treatment of modern
                  and contemporary paintings on canvas both mirror the general
                  trend in conservation toward localized or minimal
                  interventions and reflect the lack of consensus among
                  stakeholders—including the artists themselves—about an
                  acceptable degree of aging in these recently made works.
                  Surface perfection rarely coexists with age-related
                  authenticity. While the use of unconventional materials or
                  techniques in an artwork can complicate treatment, some
                  commonly used modern artist’s materials, such as acrylic
                  paints and grounds, can be exploited for our benefit during
                  treatment. The unique demands of these paintings and our
                  struggle to find suitable and successful treatments for them
                  has generated a welcome increase in scientific research into
                  modern materials as well as specialized training for emerging
                  conservators.

                <p>
                  As a conservator in private practice in New York who
                  specializes in recently created artworks, I have spent a great
                  deal of the last twenty-five years performing structural
                  repairs on canvas paintings, absorbing and adapting to the
                  ever-evolving techniques and goals of these treatments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Modern and contemporary art is loosely defined as anything
                  made in the last 75 to 125 years, a span that embraces many
                  different styles and “schools.” But for practical purposes, in
                  painting conservation we think of it as starting with the
                  Abstract Expressionist era, in the 1950s, when artists’ use of
                  nontraditional materials and painting methods dramatically
                  increased. Paintings created with non-artist-grade supports or
                  paint, with unusual media such as chewing gum or molasses, or
                  those with Minimalist surfaces that readily show every damage
                  can be difficult to treat. Monochromatic paintings, a
                  perennial lure for modern artists, in which the subtleties of
                  the surface are paramount, can be particularly challenging.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Works that are intended to be displayed unframed, unglazed,
                  and unvarnished are vulnerable to damage from handling,
                  travel, and installation. Hence, while conservators of these
                  works are rarely faced with failing fabric supports or extreme
                  cupping, they are confronted with impact cracks, tears, and
                  deformations, some of which may be exacerbated by poor
                  materials or inadequate structural supports.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While monochromatic or unconventional surfaces may be
                  challenging to maintain during a structural treatment, some of
                  the other material components of these works are more
                  resilient and less degraded than those found in older, more
                  traditional paintings, greatly improving the odds for
                  successful treatment. Cotton duck, widely used by American
                  artists for the last 70 years, behaves differently than linen.
                  The common use of acrylic gesso and sizing, which retain
                  malleability and are quite responsive to moisture,
                  temperature, and solvents, provide layers that can be
                  exploited in the flattening of cracks and cupping.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the last six decades in both private practice and
                  institutional conservation labs, the structural treatment of
                  twentieth- and twenty-first-century canvas paintings has
                  mirrored that of older paintings, moving away from lining as
                  localized solutions became more popular. Conservators have
                  promoted the embrace of minimal intervention, as well as
                  respect for authentic and historical elements and meanings of
                  the artwork, to private collectors, dealers, and artists.
                  <em>Authenticity</em> in this context describes a number of
                  qualities of an artwork other than its outward face. Tangible
                  examples include normally unseen elements, such as stretchers,
                  inscriptions, old tacking holes, studio handling marks,
                  labels, and provenance. More intangible and subjective aspects
                  are age-related patination or historical associations
                  independent of the imagery. The relative value of all these
                  types of authenticity varies widely by time and place and is a
                  reflection of the concerns of the larger culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Actual treatments I have carried out are often a compromise
                  between returning the surface of a work close to its original,
                  unblemished state and acknowledging or embracing its evidence
                  of authenticity and age. Many of these works have never been
                  treated, so the treatment methods and materials employed must
                  have an eye to future ramifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The rising popularity of contemporary art has greatly impacted
                  the conservation world. There is a fast-growing body of
                  research into modern materials and artists’ techniques. The
                  proliferation of smaller institutions devoted to contemporary
                  art collections feeds the demand for materials and technical
                  research, as well as for care and treatment of this type of
                  painting, and has spurred more specialized training in
                  conservation degree programs. Graduates have spread out across
                  the globe to staff institutions and the private studios
                  devoted solely to treatment and care of these works.

                  Changing Conservation Priorities
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In the private sector, the goal of most treatments is to make
                  an artwork exhibitable—and, depending on the stakeholders,
                  saleable. For modern and contemporary paintings, which are
                  still transitioning from brand new to antique, this can mean
                  different things for different artists, for different genres,
                  and for different owners: there is no unilateral agreement on
                  what levels of damage are considered acceptable for display.
                  While there is an obvious desire for a legible surface that
                  clearly demonstrates the artist’s aesthetic intent, there are
                  also varying notions about whether and how to value signs of
                  age or history. Institutions tend to tolerate more evidence of
                  age than the private sector, where these artworks have not
                  only an aesthetic and historic value but also perhaps a
                  significant financial one.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Treatment choices depend not only on what is possible but can
                  also be driven by what is deemed most important for a given
                  artwork by a given collector. If an owner is anxious to
                  obliterate any signs of damage or aging, no cracks are left
                  untreated. Another may want only the eye-catching, prominently
                  placed impact cracks treated, but not those at the turnover
                  edges, and for a third, a moderately cracked and aged paint
                  film is an appropriate expression of the age and history of
                  the object itself. Contemporary artists themselves have strong
                  opinions about what degree of damage is acceptable in their
                  work. In my experience, if asked, they generally say they want
                  it to look “perfect,” and are often willing to repair or
                  remake it themselves if it cannot be successfully conserved—an
                  outcome that can open up Pandora’s box. Decisions about how
                  much to treat and what to preference are not specific to
                  modern and contemporary art, of course, but have been more
                  open for discussion as the conservation field has evolved from
                  the scattered and relatively isolated group of
                  artist/restorers of old to the degree-trained conservators of
                  today.

                  What the art world now thinks of as “blue chip” contemporary
                  art was initially collected and promoted by small groups of
                  enthusiasts and was not widely sought after. It was not of
                  very high value compared to works of Cubism or Impressionism
                  or old masters, for example. Only a few conservators—all of
                  them apprentice-trained or self-taught—performed treatment
                  exclusively on these works. In New York, Daniel Goldreyer,
                  Orrin Riley, Jean Volkmer, and Margaret Watherston all
                  wrestled with the unique demands of modern and contemporary
                  paintings, adapting old techniques or inventing new ones.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Their clients were often the artists themselves, which allowed
                  for collaboration and experimentation. Their work was
                  influential and sometimes controversial. The apprentice system
                  was alive and well during this period, and many of my
                  colleagues today trained with one or more of these
                  individuals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Naturally enough, those conservators used the tried-and-true
                  structural repair techniques that succeeded on older
                  paintings. They also enthusiastically embraced the new
                  equipment, lining adhesives, and supports adopted and
                  developed in the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s, many of which were
                  introduced at the 1974 conference on Comparative Lining
                  Techniques in Greenwich. These included Gustav Berger’s Beva
                  371 adhesive (and the subsequent film form), flocked polyvinyl
                  acetate (PVA) adhesive, nap-bond adhesives, fiberglass solid
                  and fabric supports, polyester sailcloth fabric, stiff Mylar
                  interleaves, and low-pressure hot tables. I have seen examples
                  of most of these lining types on paintings that have come
                  through the studio. Some have been very successful, some less
                  so, but their application to modern and contemporary paintings
                  is problematic for some collectors and dealers: there is a
                  perception that a lined contemporary painting is somehow
                  lesser. This could be a genuine aesthetic problem, for
                  example, weave interference or other subtle alterations to the
                  surface created by pressure or heat during the lining process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More often, it is the verso that is the problem. Paintings
                  lined using heavy Mylar are a case in point. Even if the
                  lining has successfully brought the cracks or tears into
                  plane, the very shiny plastic appearance of the Mylar on the
                  verso is an inescapable reminder that a painting has had
                  fairly extensive conservation treatment. Localized repair of
                  structural damage, while often much more labor intensive, and
                  therefore expensive, than a global treatment like lining,
                  satisfies two criteria I think are important: retreatability
                  and a light touch, both of which leave the door open to better
                  future solutions for these young paintings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The search for better methods and materials for structural
                  treatments in the years leading up to Greenwich was an
                  acknowledgment that lining treatments corrected some types of
                  damage but could also create new ones. After Greenwich, this
                  realization slowly manifested as an ethical dilemma: was
                  lining too aggressive? <em>Should</em> the many individual
                  issues a lining could resolve—flaking, distortions, cupping,
                  tears, weakening fabric—be dealt with all at once? Or would it
                  be better to deal with them separately, and perhaps delay a
                  lining treatment? What began in Greenwich as an exciting,
                  hopeful exchange of new research and techniques on
                  improvements in the structural treatment of canvas paintings
                  was flipped on its head by the realization that perhaps it was
                  not the <em>method</em> of lining, but the <em>act</em> of
                  lining that needed to be reevaluated ([[Percival-Prescott
                  2003b]]). Subsequently, a period of reflection set in, and
                  many conservators began to pull away from global treatments,
                  opting for more localized, targeted treatments instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ascendency of “minimal intervention,” as this approach
                  came to be called, had a substantial effect on the continued
                  prevalence of lining. When I was a graduate student at the
                  Courtauld between 1988 and 1991, structural conservation of
                  canvas paintings in London (and perhaps elsewhere) was at a
                  crossroads. Although students were instructed in both
                  structural and cosmetic treatments, there was a separation
                  between the two in the real world at the time—an
                  acknowledgment that only specialized knowledge and experience
                  could confer mastery in one or the other. There were still
                  private studios in London where pictures were sent to be
                  lined, and the National Gallery of London maintained a
                  separate studio and conservation staff that dealt only with
                  structural work. The ample research into better methods,
                  materials, and equipment in the 1970s and ’80s spurred many
                  conservation studios to procure the new equipment needed to
                  offer lining treatments to their clientele. But the equal and
                  opposite move away from global interventions meant these
                  tables were used less and less, until in many studios they
                  became simply flat surfaces on which to do other kinds of work
                  ([[Hedley and Villers 1993]]; [[Stoner 1994]]). In the first
                  studio where I worked when I returned to New York in 1994, the
                  lining table was used only for moisture and flattening
                  treatments. I have not worked with a lining table since, using
                  instead a portable suction platen or steel weights when
                  flattening was necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This shift toward separate and/or staggered treatments has
                  become deeply embedded in the current conservation culture,
                  and we have passed that philosophy on to a wider public.
                  Conservation as a whole has a much higher profile today thanks
                  to targeted exhibitions, public-facing conservation labs in
                  museums, and treatments carried out in public galleries. One
                  change I have observed over the last few decades is that our
                  more sophisticated clients actually notice past structural
                  treatments and have opinions about them, which is a testament
                  to how much more mainstream conservation and discussion of
                  condition has become. This is in stark contrast to what George
                  Stout, one of the founders of science- and museum-based
                  conservation in America, described as the “contempt for
                  concern about condition” prevalent in his early years in the
                  field ([[Stoner 2005]]). Historically, the importance of an
                  artwork was confined to its surface imagery and art historical
                  importance; whether the painting had had conservation
                  treatment—even treatment that radically altered the
                  surface—was not considered relevant.

                  is not surprising that some examples of early linings of
                  modern and contemporary paintings that have passed through our
                  studio provide cautionary tales. This is particularly true for
                  Minimalist paintings, which have the infuriating
                  characteristics (to the conservator, at least) of being the
                  most in need of structural intervention when cracks appear and
                  having the least tolerance for any intervention. Given the
                  extremely subtle nature of the aesthetics of these paintings,
                  some examples of early linings we have seen exhibit changes to
                  the paint film that we are anxious to avoid repeating, such as
                  locking cracks in place with thick layers of adhesives and
                  auxiliary supports, thus prohibiting access to the reverse.
                  One previously treated, multipanel Minimalist painting I
                  worked on had numerous impact cracks on all five canvases. Two
                  of the panels were unlined while the other three had been
                  lined with thickly flocked PVA. While the cracks in the
                  unlined elements were improved with local flattening
                  treatments to the reverse, the PVA on the other three could
                  not be safely removed, so the cracks could not be retreated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although I have seen old linings—of all varieties—that have
                  worked well and remain sturdy, this is not always the case. A
                  great deal of the success relies on the experience of the
                  practitioner. Glue-paste linings in particular seem to require
                  a vast amount of particularized knowledge and skill. On a
                  Minimalist painting, they can be wonderfully successful, but
                  they can also cause weave interference due to lining pressure
                  and small distortions caused by uneven adhesive application or
                  inherent faults in the canvas weave.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Wax-resin and Beva linings are less stiff and unyielding, but
                  that can create problems as well, such as spotty delamination
                  between the original and lining canvas due either to an
                  initial, uneven heat application or eventual degradation of
                  the adhesive (<strong><a href="#fig-38-1">figs. 38.1</a>,
                    <a href="#fig-38-2">38.2</a></strong>). The inherent flexibility of these adhesives—so useful in
                  other contexts—is often no match for the paint film’s strong
                  need to equilibrate forces around existing cracks, leading to
                  their reappearance over the long term. I have seen wax-resin
                  linings change the gloss of a surface or darken with time,
                  throwing off the balance of light and dark in the composition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The use of a very stiff lining material or interlayer, such as
                  heavy Mylar, has proved successful in some cases, but in
                  others, such interventions only locked the partially flattened
                  cracks in place. The same can be said for thickly flocked PVA
                  adhesives, as noted above. Their stiffness overwhelmed the
                  lining fabrics, and they cannot be reversed without a great
                  deal of mechanical force or solvent ([[Rabin 1976]]). Local
                  treatments with patches have resulted in unsightly bulges over
                  time, caused by the shrinking of adhesives combined with
                  realignment of forces between those canvas fibers that are
                  held in place by adhesives and those that are not (<a href="#fig-38-3"><strong>fig. 38.3</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  For paintings meant to be displayed without frames or with
                  only modest strip frames, the bulk added by any kind of lining
                  fabric and adhesive can compromise the crispness of a
                  painting’s edges by forcing some of the unpainted tacking edge
                  onto the face of the painting. Many of these treatments are
                  difficult or impossible to reverse, and often lead to
                  devaluation, both aesthetic and financial. Even past
                  treatments sanctioned by the artist are subject to scrutiny.
                  What was once acceptable, maybe even cutting edge, is now
                  often viewed as undesirable in modern and contemporary
                  paintings.

                  Local Treatment and Preventive Conservation
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The most common structural damage we see in our studio is
                  impact-related cracking of the paint film. This type of
                  cracking often takes the form of concentric circles or
                  feather-like shapes, resulting from accidental knocks to the
                  face or the reverse. They also appear as straight lines
                  directly on top of the edges of stretcher lips, rails, and
                  crossbars, caused by repeated contact with the sub-support, or
                  as smaller systems along the crossbars where people have
                  distended the back of the canvas while grabbing the bars in
                  transit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While aesthetically disturbing, these impact damages do not
                  always pose an actual threat to the overall stability of the
                  painting. Successful flattening of such damage has always
                  depended on softening or reforming both the paint and ground
                  layers while simultaneously stiffening the canvas layer. Doing
                  this successfully through localized treatment is possible, but
                  the history and literature on treating cracks without
                  resorting to lining is scant and the conclusions often
                  discouraging. Moisture, solvent, heat, and pressure have been
                  explored in various combinations ([[Gridley 2017]]).
                  Experiments have been carried out in which the reverse of the
                  canvas is treated in various ways to equilibrate the
                  distortion caused on the face by local breaks in tension
                  ([[Hough and Michalski 1999]]; [[Dimond and Young 2003]]; and
                  <a href="#paper-41">Hough and Michalski</a> in this volume),
                  but there are practical challenges, and local treatments are
                  not always less time consuming than global interventions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Treating numerous similar damages one by one can be both labor
                  intensive and expensive. However, there are collectors for
                  whom an “untouched” or minimally treated artwork commands a
                  premium, so there is value in underwriting the cost and time
                  such treatments consume. This attitude has allowed our studio
                  to develop expertise in carrying out such treatments.
                  Treatment of impact cracks is often the first structural
                  intervention in a modern or contemporary painting’s life, and
                  it is very important to acknowledge that future, better
                  treatments may be possible only if we tread lightly now.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As noted earlier, the current and widely adopted approach to
                  structural repair of modern and contemporary paintings is one
                  where a desire for local or minimal intervention meets a
                  growing respect for authenticity. For example, there is
                  perceived value in an unlined painting, with its original
                  wooden auxiliary support and the verso of the canvas available
                  for viewing. For eyes now accustomed to localized treatment of
                  cracks or thread-by-thread tear mends, linings can appear
                  heavy handed. The occasional request to remove old linings
                  without replacing them does not always occur because the
                  lining has failed. More often, the lining itself is viewed as
                  an undesirable condition of the painting. The many types of
                  values embraced by stakeholders—unblemished surface, stable
                  condition, age-appropriate damage, retention of hidden
                  original or authentic components, unease with evidence of past
                  conservation—are often contradictory, if not actually mutually
                  exclusive, and present thorny ethical dilemmas when discussing
                  treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While minimal intervention and authenticity often complement
                  one another in a treatment, that is not always the case.
                  Removing a lining to reveal the original verso is not a minor
                  treatment. Unstretching a painting to replace or modify an
                  original sub-support that is inadequate or actively damaging
                  the painting is not without risk and may end with an
                  unsatisfactory compromise (<a href="#fig-38-4"><strong>fig. 38.4</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  An important strategy for mitigating against the return of old
                  cracks or the creation of new ones is preventive conservation.
                  The installation of backing boards and handles prevents knocks
                  from the reverse or edges being gripped during transport and
                  installation. More complex interventions include stretcher-bar
                  or loose-linings for individual paintings. Where appropriate,
                  framing and glazing are good protection, as are wrapping and
                  crating to prevent contact with the face of the painting.
                  Preventive conservation, while perhaps not understood by
                  galleries or collectors to be a whole subspecialty of our
                  profession, is something of which they are very aware. Proper
                  storage, professional shipping, and environmental controls are
                  not just institutional priorities; they have worked their way
                  into the mindsets of commercial galleries, private collectors,
                  and art handling and storage facilities.

                <p>
                  Successful local treatment relies to some extent on the
                  material integrity of the painting itself. If the canvas still
                  has adequate strength and the paint films remain relatively
                  coherent and well adhered to the support, minimal intervention
                  can both solve the current problem and leave the door open to
                  future treatments. While some artists have incorporated
                  unpredictable and problematic non-art materials into their
                  works, generally, the increased use of synthetic polymer-based
                  materials and cotton supports in modern and contemporary
                  paintings has advantages in problem-solving localized
                  treatments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps the most significant material difference between older
                  and newer paintings is the widespread use of acrylic grounds
                  and synthetic sizing. I would estimate that 90% or more of the
                  post-1965 paintings I have examined, regardless of the type of
                  support fabric or paint medium, are painted on acrylic
                  grounds. The fast-drying, nontoxic qualities of acrylic
                  grounds and sizing are very appealing to painters. In a nod to
                  both this and to conservation research, one American
                  manufacturer, Gamblin Colors, has even discontinued sales of
                  rabbit-skin glue sizing and its proprietary traditional gesso
                  (which also contained rabbit-skin glue). In so doing, Gamblin
                  cited scientific research by the Smithsonian Conservation Lab
                  that deemed these materials to perform poorly on canvas
                  paintings over the long term due to the glue and fabric’s high
                  reactivity to changes in relative humidity. The more brittle
                  paint layer(s) do not swell and contract as easily, and this
                  incompatible elasticity can result in cracking or delamination
                  of the paint ([[Gamblin n.d.]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the past two decades, significant analysis and research has
                  been done on acrylics. Much of it has centered on the various
                  paint components and additives, as well as their aging
                  properties, and what that means for cleaning,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  but from a structural repair perspective, acrylic has some
                  unique features. Its continued sensitivity to moisture, heat,
                  and commonly used solvents such as alcohols and ketones makes
                  it an ideal candidate for reforming ([[Zumbühl et al. 2007]]).
                  When the acrylic is confined to the ground and size layer,
                  with other media in the image layers, there are additional
                  opportunities to manipulate its properties, allowing less
                  interference with the paint and canvas layers.

                  Since World War II, when imported linen was hard to come by,
                  cotton duck has been widely used in America, and to a lesser
                  degree elsewhere. It became popular due to availability of
                  large bolt sizes and comparatively low cost. It is unclear
                  what the widespread use of cotton supports will bring us in
                  terms of future structural problems, but in my experience they
                  seem to suffer less embrittlement than linen during aging,
                  even though the shorter and fluffier fibers are harder to work
                  with individually, as required in a thread-by-thread tear
                  mending. Linen, still widely used globally, retains its
                  strength and resiliency for decades, allowing conservators to
                  delay lining or other major structural interventions. Ongoing
                  research into the materials and structure of aging
                  contemporary primed canvases remains necessary to guide us in
                  the future (see [Carter et
                  al.](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/39-Gridley/paper-63)

                  Structural treatment of modern and contemporary canvas
                  paintings presents both technical and aesthetic challenges. In
                  the private sector, treatments are judged not only by improved
                  aesthetics or stability but sometimes also by how readily
                  detectable a treatment may be to a future observer. While the
                  various stakeholders—collectors, artists, and conservators—all
                  wish for a work to be exhibitable, their definitions of that
                  may not be identical, and furthermore are bound to change as
                  the artworks and their components naturally age and new
                  treatments evolve. The struggle to achieve a near-perfect
                  surface while exercising restraint in intervention continues
                  to drive innovations in treatment. The field has come a long
                  way in the last seventy-five years: refined technical
                  abilities, in-depth materials analysis, and a shared
                  philosophical framework have allowed us to bring a more
                  nuanced understanding to our work.

                  In 2018, the Conservation Department of the Menil Collection
                  performed a novel wax-extraction treatment utilizing Evolon CR
                  on <em>Pitcher, Candlestick, and Black Fish</em> (1943) by
                  Georges Braque. The treatment was preceded by extensive
                  wax-resin extraction trials; multiple methods of extraction
                  were tested, focusing on the variable contributions of heat,
                  suction, solvent selection, and the capillary action of an
                  Evolon CR substrate. Based upon optimized parameters
                  determined in the preliminary trials, the wax-resin extraction
                  treatment on the painting was performed on a suction table,
                  utilizing xylenes-saturated Evolon CR against the back of the
                  canvas, ShellSol OMS–saturated Evolon CR against the face, and
                  two cycles of suction and heat. Visually, the canvas regained
                  weave distinction and a variety of surface that is inherent to
                  the way that paint conforms to fabric. Spectrophotometry
                  readings taken before and after wax extraction show a
                  perceivable lightening of the ground. After treatment, the
                  weight of the canvas had decreased by 14%.

                  “Why subject it to this rack-like torture? . . . Restorers are
                  amazing. They have transformed my guitar into a tambourine.”
                  So said Georges Braque to John Richardson after viewing one of
                  his still lifes that had been wax-resin lined. He completed
                  the sentiment with a tap of his brush on the painting’s taut
                  surface ([[Richardson 2004|, 533]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2016, the Conservation Department at the Menil Collection
                  began a long-anticipated cleaning of Georges Braque’s 1943
                  painting <em>Pitcher, Candlestick, and Black Fish</em> (<em>Vase et poisson noir</em>). The painting had been treated in 1961 by Caroline Keck,
                  receiving a “superficial cleaning,” wax-resin lining, and a
                  poly butyl methacrylate varnish.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  The motivation for lining was largely preventative. In a
                  letter in the painting’s file, Keck explains that “the result
                  of the rolling and its mishandling has caused cracks to
                  develop, some easily seen with the eye in the yellow area,
                  others developing definitely in the structure but visible
                  under magnification only at this stage…this is an important
                  moment to treat the painting, to prevent any serious damage
                  and even loss of surface as these cracks go further.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  The painting was likely rolled twice in 1940, when Braque
                  travelled to the south of France and then back to Paris at the
                  beginning of World War II ([[Danchev 2006]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  That Braque sought variation in his final surfaces is
                  effectively demonstrated by Favero, Mysak, and Khandekar in
                  their technical study of twenty-one paintings from 1928 to
                  1944. Braque achieved a variety of textural effects by mixing
                  sand, fine gravel, and quartz into his grounds or using combs
                  and sculptors’ tools to scrape through wet paint ([[Favero,
                  Mysak, and Khandekar 2013]]). He created more delicate
                  variations of surface by mixing varnish or beeswax into the
                  paint or by selectively varnishing certain passages.
                  Richardson describes his practice of applying a varnish to
                  certain passages, sometimes according to a viewer’s
                  expectations of an object’s reflectance (as in his paintings
                  of the 1920s and ’30s, where shiny objects such as a glass
                  vase received a glossy finish while matte objects such as a
                  lemon received nothing), or sometimes in deliberately playful
                  ways that go against a viewer’s expectations by rendering
                  inherently shiny objects matte ([[Richardson 2004|, 533]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In <em>Pitcher,</em> the cleaning revealed that Braque
                  manipulated the final surface sheen with two black paints—one
                  that is velvety matte and one that is glossy—to establish
                  subtle contrasts across the surface.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  For instance, a fish featured in the foreground is almost
                  entirely painted in matte black paint except for two small
                  reveals around its eye and gills where Braque left underlying
                  glossy paint in reserve, creating a shiny iris and gleaming
                  gill line (<a href="#fig-39-1"><strong>fig. 39.1</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to creating variable gloss and matteness, Braque
                  manipulated the texture of <em>Pitcher’s</em> surface. Fine
                  sgraffito marks outline the lemons, and medium to wide gouges
                  create detail in the background, indicating that Braque used a
                  variety of tools to establish a variable surface with tactile
                  characteristics. In certain passages, grooves unite with
                  precise paint application, merging the textural and the
                  visual: two gouges extend upward from a cherry in the
                  foreground, revealing dark underlying paint and beginning its
                  stem; after approximately 1 centimeter, a fine stroke of brown
                  paint fills them in and completes the stem’s length.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At some unknown date prior to Keck’s 1961 treatment, the
                  painting had also received a bleached shellac coating.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  Though it is unclear who applied the shellac coating, two
                  reasons make it highly unlikely to have been Braque: his
                  dislike of overall varnishes for their unifying effect on
                  sheen, and the areas of retouching underneath the shellac
                  layer that were discovered during the cleaning. These had been
                  incorrectly applied to grooves in the paint that were
                  misinterpreted as abrasions; there are multiple examples of
                  similar, nonretouched grooves throughout the composition.
                  During the lining process, the shellac had softened and
                  deformed from exposure to heat and pressure, resulting in a
                  tangled network of ridges and valleys that imparted an
                  artificial texture across the surface. Visible both under
                  magnification and to the naked eye, the compromised shellac
                  scattered light and hindered legibility of subtle brushstrokes
                  and sgraffiti.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Given Braque’s practices regarding his differentiated paint
                  surfaces, the rationale for the 2016 cleaning was twofold: to
                  reduce the compromised shellac and to restore the surface’s
                  original, varied sheen and texture by removing the varnish
                  layers and their unifying gloss. The decision to pursue a
                  lining reversal and wax-resin extraction was motivated in part
                  by the possibility of enhancing reflective and textural gains
                  revealed by the cleaning, as well as by the artist’s
                  aforementioned dislike of what he perceived as an artificial
                  planarity and stiffness imposed by linings.
                </p>
                <h2 id="treatment-trials" tabindex="-1">Treatment Trials</h2>
                <p>
                  The wax extraction on the painting was preceded by forty-eight
                  test trials performed on strips of the lining canvas, which
                  was removed from the painting mechanically by peeling it back
                  at a low angle. Examination of the canvas fibers after removal
                  of the lining revealed that they were in good condition and
                  had not been shaved prior to lining. Of the trials, the first
                  twenty-eight were more exploratory in nature, while the final
                  twenty were more controlled, as the most important treatment
                  parameters emerged. The lining canvas strips were subjected to
                  different conditions exploring multiple variables, including
                  solvent location in relation to the bulk of the wax-resin
                  mixture (whether the solvent was introduced from the back or
                  from both front and back), the type of solvent, the solvent
                  delivery system (brush-applied, gelled, or by fabric), the
                  wicking layers (number of layers, type of material used, and
                  frequency of change out during treatment), the temperature,
                  and the use of suction. Initially, gels were used as a solvent
                  delivery system, after the methods published by Bettina
                  Landgrebe and Gunnar Heydenreich ([[Landgrebe 1988]];
                  [[Heydenreich 1994]]). However, relatively early on, it became
                  clear that Evolon CR could deliver solvent as effectively as a
                  gel, while minimizing preparation and simultaneously acting as
                  a means for absorption.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A general setup of the trials from the Willard suction table
                  surface upward was as follows: heat and/or suction provided by
                  a vacuum hot table, one to three wicking layers (Evolon CR,
                  paper towels, or linen), an “acting” solvent layer (sheet of
                  Evolon CR or gel containing a solvent with a high chemical
                  affinity for the wax resin), the lining canvas strip face
                  up,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  and in some trials a low-polarity “superficial” solvent
                  applied by brush or Evolon CR to the face. Evolon CR is a
                  nonwoven textile composed of polyester and polyamide
                  microfilaments that can absorb up to four times its weight in
                  water and slightly more than that in hydrocarbon solvents.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  The acting solvent layer is meant to promote dissolution of
                  the wax resin, while the superficial solvent encourages
                  movement of deeply impregnated wax resin out of the lining
                  canvas and into the wicking layers below.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Exploring a few trials in detail illustrates some key
                  takeaways that ultimately informed the treatment parameters on
                  the painting. The time-consuming nature of the trials made it
                  difficult to do extensive investigations of all variables.
                  Trials included here offer empirical findings and
                  observations. Moving forward, performing a greater number of
                  trials per single variable will be necessary in order to form
                  conclusions that are statistically relevant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Efficacy of wax resin removal was evaluated based on the
                  appearance and feel of the lining canvas strips and their
                  percentage of weight loss after treatment. In order to
                  establish the maximum amount of wax resin that could be
                  extracted, small sections of lining canvas were individually
                  weighed, and then each was immersed in one of the range of
                  solvents being considered for use (xylenes, ShellSol OMS,
                  hexamethyldisiloxane, and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) for
                  approximately forty-eight hours, after which it was removed
                  from the solvent, allowed to dry, and reweighed. This
                  demonstrated that the maximum amount of wax resin that could
                  be extracted was around 30% of the weight of the coupon. The
                  most successful solvents, xylenes and ShellSol Odorless
                  Mineral Spirits (OMS), resulted in 31% and 32%, respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trials that involved application of solvent to the face
                  resulted in the supplest canvas feel and the best final
                  appearance—clarity of weave, saturation, evenness of wax-resin
                  removal—with comparable results regarding weight loss
                  percentage. In a set of eight trials, four involving
                  superficial solvents and four without, all of those involving
                  superficial solvents resulted in the supplest canvas feel and
                  most improved clarity of canvas weave. While it was clear that
                  the application of solvent to the face would not necessarily
                  result in a higher percentage of weight loss (taken as a
                  measure of efficacy of wax-resin removal), the visual and
                  tactile characteristics were deemed more improved in the
                  lining canvases that had received superficial solvent than in
                  those that had not.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using xylenes as the acting solvent consistently dissolved
                  more wax-resin mixture than did ShellSol OMS. Trials with
                  xylenes in the acting solvent layer resulted in good clarity
                  of weave with no visible wax-resin residue, a supple canvas
                  feel, and higher weight-loss percentages. Trials with ShellSol
                  OMS in the acting solvent layer resulted in visible wax-resin
                  residues, lower weight-loss percentages, and a blanched final
                  appearance, likely resulting from incomplete dissolution of
                  residual wax-resin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Halfway through the trials it became clear that the downward
                  draw of the wax-resin mixture into the Evolon CR via capillary
                  pressure is significantly stronger than any contribution from
                  the downward draw of air by the suction table. In trials with
                  and without suction, both trials resulted in good clarity of
                  canvas weave, no visible wax-resin residue, a supple canvas
                  feel, and comparable losses in weight. However, it was
                  important to use the suction table anyway, for two reasons: as
                  a means of ensuring close conformity between the lining canvas
                  strip and the Evolon CR, and as a means to evacuate solvents
                  and avoid a solvent-package effect. In trials without suction,
                  droplets of solvent were visible pooling on the underside of
                  the Dartek covering the stack, which we deemed a nonviable
                  method for the eventual treatment of the painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consistently more wax resin was extracted when the trials
                  involved heat. The strong capillary effect of the Evolon CR
                  raised the possibility that extraction utilizing the solvent
                  might be possible at room temperature. Trials performed at
                  approximately room temperature resulted in a slightly improved
                  clarity of canvas weave on the back of the strip, but an
                  increased obfuscation of weave and darkening on the front. The
                  canvas remained stiff after treatment and underwent minimal
                  weight loss.

                  Using a larger volume of acting solvent results in a higher
                  percentage of weight loss in the lining canvas strip. In a set
                  of four trials—two involving an acting solvent layer of twice
                  the weight of the Evolon CR and two involving three times the
                  weight of the Evolon CR—trials involving the larger volume of
                  solvent resulted in the highest percentage of weight loss.

                <p>
                  When it came time to design the treatment methodology for the
                  painting, several parameters had become clear from the trials.
                  A low-polarity superficial solvent, xylenes as the acting
                  solvent, suction for solvent evaporation and conformity, and
                  heat would result in the highest percentage of weight loss and
                  the best final feel and appearance of the canvas. In spite of
                  the success of trials involving higher volumes of solvent, we
                  decided to load the Evolon CR with twice its weight in solvent
                  (rather than three times), because of the relatively finer
                  weave of the painting’s canvas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  Other parameters were less certain, such as whether to change
                  out the wicking layer once or twice, and whether one or two
                  rounds of extraction should be performed. Ultimately, we
                  decided to change out the wicking layer once in order to
                  minimize handling and to determine whether a second round was
                  necessary after seeing the results of the first round.

                <h2 id="treatment" tabindex="-1">Treatment</h2>
                <p>
                  Broadly speaking, the treatment involved applying Evolon CR
                  that had been saturated with ShellSol OMS to the face and
                  Evolon CR that had been saturated with xylenes to the back
                  while placing the entire stack under heat and suction. As in
                  the trials, the volume of solvent in the Evolon CR was
                  determined by weight. In order to load the Evolon CR with
                  solvent, a sheet of the material was weighed, rolled, and
                  folded and placed in a clean, empty metal paint container.
                  Double its weight in solvent was added, and the container was
                  sealed and left overnight. The painting was weighed before and
                  after treatment by placing it on a rigid board and subtracting
                  the weight of the board alone from the weight of the two
                  together. Spectrophotometric measurements were taken before
                  and after treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The treatment occurred in two rounds, each comprising three
                  stages. For all rounds, the Evolon CR was applied as single
                  sheets cut larger than the size of the painting.

                      A cross section of the material stack from the Willard
                      table upward is as follows: Hollytex to prevent adhesion
                      to the lining table; a dry sheet of Evolon CR as a wicking
                      layer; Evolon CR saturated with twice its weight in
                      xylenes (the equivalent of 100 mL); the painting face up;
                      and Dartek.

                      The table temperature was set to cycle between 39ºC and
                      51ºC, though the temperature at the painting’s surface
                      consistently registered 2ºC–3ºC lower when checked with an
                      infrared thermometer.

                    <p>
                      With suction set to 2 mbar, the painting was left in this
                      stack configuration for 15 minutes.

                    <p>
                      The Dartek was temporarily removed, Evolon CR with twice
                      its weight in OMS (the equivalent of 120&nbsp;mL), was placed
                      over the front, and the Dartek was replaced.

                      The table temperature’s cycle remained the same
                      (39ºC–51ºC), and the painting’s surface continued to
                      measure 2ºC–3ºC lower.

                    <p>
                      The suction was increased to 7 mbar, and then the painting
                      was left for 20 minutes.

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      After 20 minutes, the wicking Evolon CR was replaced with
                      a new, dry sheet, the Dartek was put back in place, and
                      the stack was left for another 20 minutes.

                      The heat was turned off, but the suction was left at 7
                      mbar.

                    <p>
                      The painting was left to desaturate and cool for 30–50
                      minutes.

                  Wax-resin residues were clearly visible on the back of the
                  canvas after the first round, so all three stages were
                  repeated for a second round.

                  Treatment Results and Discussion
                </h2>
                <p>
                  When considering the treatment results, there are a variety of
                  aspects to consider, including the aesthetics of the pictorial
                  layer, the planarity of the support, the appearance of the
                  back of the canvas, the percentage of weight loss, and color
                  change. The wax-resin extraction resulted in relatively subtle
                  changes to the pictorial layer. The colors in the face of the
                  painting were not significantly altered, but there was a
                  clearly perceptible lightening of the ground visible on the
                  tacking margins. The painting does not have areas of exposed
                  ground within the design, as do many of Braque’s pictures, so
                  the impact of this brightening upon the overall color harmony
                  of the composition is less noticeable than it would be if the
                  ground was a defining element. There was no perceivable change
                  to the painting’s varying sheens of matte and glossy black
                  paints (<a href="#fig-39-2"><strong>fig. 39.2</strong></a>; compare to <a href="#fig-39-1"><strong>fig. 39.1</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The planarity of the canvas is now visibly more congruent with
                  the age of the paint layer, as it no longer has the rigid
                  tautness it did before. Six horizontal cracks spanning the
                  painting’s width are more prominent, resulting in subtle
                  planar distortions that are visible in the final stretching
                  (<a href="#fig-39-3"><strong>fig. 39.3</strong></a>). These cracks likely relate to when it was rolled during
                  Braque’s evacuation from Paris at the outset of World War II;
                  their return make visible an aspect of the painting’s history
                  that was previously masked by the lining’s flatness. In
                  addition to evidencing history, this return of dimensionality
                  restores a relationship between paint and support that is more
                  in keeping with Braque’s governing thoughts about the artistic
                  process. Favero et al. have eloquently summarized these using
                  an example described by the artist: “For Braque, color was
                  inextricably bound to material and texture: ‘Dip two white
                  cloths, but of different material, into the same dye; their
                  color will be different’” ([[Favero, Mysak, and Khandekar,
                  2013|, 99]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  Restoring the pliancy of the linen that had formerly been
                  restricted by the wax resin creates an interaction between
                  color and support that was previously absent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to an improved clarity of weave, a number of
                  previously invisible marks became apparent on the back of the
                  canvas after the saturating effect of the wax resin was
                  removed (<a href="#fig-39-4"><strong>figs. 39.4</strong></a>
                  and <a href="#fig-39-5"><strong>39.5</strong></a>). There are areas where the ground has seeped through the
                  canvas (<a href="#fig-39-6"><strong>fig. 39.6</strong></a>), and several dark marks, some of which follow contours of
                  an underlying figural composition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Several areas of lighter canvas appeared on the back,
                  including six horizontal lines, corresponding with cracks on
                  the front, and a few larger forms, coinciding with areas of
                  thin paint application. It seems likely that these, and other
                  intermittent light areas, are areas of blanched wax or wax
                  resin left in the canvas interstices. Some of these light
                  areas have fine white deposits; Fourier transform infrared
                  (FTIR) analysis of a sample from one deposit closely matches
                  the reference spectra for wax.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  Current analysis is inconclusive regarding the presence of a
                  resin such as dammar, Ketone Resin N, or Zonarez B-85, which
                  were common components in the Kecks’ wax-resin mixtures.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  Analysis of the white deposits with gas-chromatography
                  mass-spectrometry is forthcoming. UV photos taken of the back
                  of the canvas after wax-extraction show a faint fluorescence
                  in these areas, suggesting the presence of wax or wax-resin
                  residues (<a href="#fig-39-7"><strong>fig. 39.7</strong></a>). The blanching may be related to the higher evaporation
                  rate of solvents at an air interface, such as a comparatively
                  open pathway of a crack versus a solid paint film ([[Hansen
                  1970]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  UV photos were taken of all eight Evolon CR sheets used during
                  treatment as a way of visualizing the wax-resin’s location
                  after extraction. The sheets on the face showed almost no
                  wax-resin absorption, save for residues on the tacking margins
                  and turnover edges. The acting solvent layers show an even
                  distribution of wax resin, as do the dry wicking layers placed
                  underneath for the first half of the treatment rounds. The
                  wicking layer that was placed underneath the acting solvent
                  layer for the second half of the treatment rounds shows an
                  uneven distribution and minimal absorption of wax resin.
                  Comparison with the front of the painting indicates that the
                  distribution of wax resin in the wicking layer corresponds to
                  cracks and thin paint layers. As mentioned, the pattern of
                  UV-fluorescent and blanched material suggests that these areas
                  retained wax throughout each treatment round. It seems likely
                  the wax resin was not removed entirely because a higher
                  solvent evaporation rate inhibited sustained dissolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The weight of the canvas decreased by 14%, a percentage
                  significantly lower than the weight changes that were achieved
                  during the most successful trials, which were consistently
                  over 30%.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  The percentage difference between the trials and the painting
                  does not necessarily mean less wax resin was removed, however,
                  because—when compared to the lining canvas strips—the wax
                  resin contributed less to the weight of the painting due to
                  the paint and ground layers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Spectrophotometry measurements were taken from fifteen
                  locations in total: 3 from the ground on the tacking margins
                  and twelve from areas within the face of the painting. The
                  measurements of the ground on the tacking margins confirmed
                  quantitatively what is apparent visually: the color of the
                  ground became lighter and warmer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  The ΔE~76~ of an average of three measurements taken from the
                  ground is 4.12 ± 0.41, the L* increased by 3.71 ±0.37 toward
                  white, the a* increased by 0.537 ± 0.12 toward red, and the b*
                  increased by 1.71 ±0.20 toward yellow. It is likely the
                  reduction in wax resin increased scattering, resulting in a
                  brighter color ([[Rees Jones 1990]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following the wax-resin extraction, the tacking margins
                  received an edge-lining with linen and Beva 371 film. During
                  restretching, some consolidation was necessary along the
                  turnover edges, and it was possible to use sturgeon glue,
                  indicating the possibility of treatment with aqueous methods.
                  The painting will receive a rigid backing board and will be
                  reframed and glazed.

                <p>
                  There are several avenues that deserve further research. The
                  time at which the wicking layer is changed out should be
                  reconsidered. The wicking layer that was in place for the
                  <em>first</em> half of each treatment round appears to have
                  absorbed an amount of wax resin that is comparable to the
                  xylenes-saturated sheet. The wicking layer that was in place
                  for the <em>second</em> half of each round appears to have
                  absorbed the least amount of wax resin. Perhaps the
                  xylenes-saturated sheet above the wicking layer became too
                  saturated with wax resin by this point in the treatment to
                  allow further absorption below it. Or perhaps there was not
                  enough solvent in the system to encourage movement of the wax
                  resin into the Evolon CR. Understanding the timeline of
                  wax-resin absorption better could help to bring about more

                  Exactly what was extracted needs to be identified. Does what
                  was removed correspond with the components of the wax-resin
                  mixture? Have certain materials been preferentially removed?
                  Are there differences between the composition of the material
                  present on the Evolon CR on the back and that on the front?
                  Analysis is pending on extractions from the Evolon CR sheets
                  used during treatment.

                  It is worth exploring whether there are alternative
                  hydrocarbon solvents that would be equally effective. As
                  evidenced by the solvent-immersion test, ShellSol OMS actually
                  extracted a similar amount of wax resin by weight to xylenes
                  (32% compared to 31%). Clearly, it had an affinity for the
                  wax-resin mixture, but it takes longer to work. Solvents with
                  similar properties should be explored, perhaps ShellSol D38.

                  Weight loss per surface area should be measured instead of
                  weight change percentages, as Gunnar Heydenreich did in his
                  1994 wax-resin extraction treatment ([[Heydenreich 1994|,
                  25]]). This will more easily allow for comparison of wax-resin
                  loss across samples of varying weights and sizes. The impact
                  of a higher solvent volume on the amount of wax resin
                  extracted should be explored with more trials. Perhaps using a
                  higher volume with a shorter treatment duration could optimize
                  the amount of wax resin extracted while minimizing solvent and
                  heat exposure.

                  We need to better understand what is causing the blanching
                  around cracks and areas of thin paint. Is it related to
                  incomplete wax-resin removal, a higher rate of solvent
                  evaporation, or a combination?

                <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  Wax-resin linings have a mixed legacy—they partially address
                  physics at the expense of certain aesthetics. Qualities like
                  saturation and color harmony are sacrificed for a planarity
                  free from distortions that can impair legibility. Though
                  wax-resin impregnation has been shown to improve tensile
                  properties ([[Hedley 1975]]) and increase protection against
                  changes in humidity for short exposure times ([[Young and
                  Ackroyd 2001]]), it has also been shown to increase
                  contraction forces resulting from long exposures to high
                  humidity ([[Andersen et al. 2014]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Its impact on color change is similarly contradictory.
                  Wax-resin linings affect color saturation to varying degrees,
                  dependent upon the presence of sizing, pigment type, medium
                  type, layer thickness, and hiding power ([[Nieder, Hendricks,
                  and Burnstock 2011|, 98]]; [[Froment 2019|, 439]]). Bomford
                  and Staniforth have demonstrated that wax-resin impregnation
                  has a significant impact on the color of canvas of varying
                  weights as well as grounds of differing compositions,
                  particularly those that are underbound, but whether such a
                  change is visible in the painting is dependent on the degree
                  to which the canvas or ground plays a visible role in the
                  composition ([[Bomford and Staniforth 1981]]). Though recent
                  studies have indicated that certain artists chose to have
                  their paintings lined very early in a painting’s life or even
                  during the painting process ([[Hackney 2004b]]), it is clear
                  from Richardson’s writings that Braque preferred a surface in
                  which the variable qualities of stretched canvas are visible.

                  A treatment such as this one is not undertaken lightly. In
                  terms of solvent amounts and their potential effects on paint
                  films, the treatment is not dissimilar to the process of
                  cleaning. Above all, the words of the artist offer direction.
                  Without its lining,
                  <em>Pitcher, Candlestick, and Black Fish</em> presents a
                  planarity that is more congruent with its age and honors its
                  history. Furthermore, reduction of the wax-resin adhesive
                  allows physical response to environmental fluctuations.
                  Perhaps most importantly, it restores the relationship of the
                  canvas’s materiality and paint layers to one more in keeping
                  with Braque’s artistic practice. When considering Braque’s
                  statements about the interconnectedness of those two elements
                  at the start of treatment, the question became why continue to
                  subject it to this racklike torture?

                        It is assumed that “superficial cleaning” refers to dirt
                        removal. Keck’s treatment report says the painting was
                        varnished but does not say with what. At the time they
                        were treating <em>Pitcher</em>, the Kecks were also
                        treating a Picasso from the de Menils, which
                        <em>is</em> documented as receiving a poly butyl
                        methacrylate lining in the same treatment report as
                        Braque’s <em>Pitcher</em> (Caroline Keck, letter in the
                        conservation file, March 13, 1961). Sample T 703 s14
                        taken from a scraping in the varnish atop a yellow band
                        in the background near the top center exhibited a
                        spectrum, that, through spectral subtraction, indicated
                        that a butyl methacrylate-containing species could be
                        present. Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier
                        transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected by
                        C.&nbsp;E. Rogge using a Lumos FTIR microscope equipped with
                        a motorized germanium ATR crystal with a 100 μm tip
                        (Bruker). The spectra are an average of 64 scans at 4
                        cm^−1^ spectral resolution, and an ATR correction was
                        automatically applied by the Opus 7.0 instrument control

                        compounds responsible for the orange fluorescence. See

                        Evolon CR belongs to a line of fabrics made by
                        Freudenberg that have a wide variety of uses, including
                        anti-mite bedding, cleaning cloths, sound absorption,
                        and sun protection. Evolon CR was developed by Deffner
                        and Johann, a conservation materials and tools supplier
                        in Germany, in discussion with the manufacturer
                        specifically for use in conservation. It is PVC-free and
                        produced without solvents or binders. See “Evolon CR,”

                        the superficial solvent as free solvent brushed over the
                        surface or introduced by means of saturated Evolon CR;
                        both produced similarly successful results. In practice,
                        the saturated Evolon sheets proved a more reliable way
                        of delivering a known amount of solvent uniformly across
                        the surface and eliminating the variable pressure and
                        delivery volumes associated with brush application. It
                        should be noted, however, that the use of Evolon CR
                        prevents observation of the paint surface during
                        treatment.

                        The difference perceptible to the human eye has been a
                        subject of debate in the literature since the 1980s.
                        Some authors suggest that one CIELAB unit (1ΔE*)
                        corresponds to the smallest difference that is
                        perceivable to the naked eye, while other authors
                        suggest it is between one and two units, and others
                        above two. For purposes of comparison with other
                        research, a ΔE* of 1 was defined as the perceptible
                        limit in this paper. See [[Froment 2019|, 140]].

                  Single cracks in contemporary paintings on canvas can be
                  disfiguring due to cupping. In 1999, the authors published a
                  study of fourteen different methods for local treatment of
                  such cracks, applied to slack paintings ([[Hough and Michalski
                  1999]]). Model paintings were created to simulate contemporary
                  paintings of oil paint on acrylic ground on cotton duck
                  fabric. Nine cracks, 15&nbsp;cm (6 in.) long, were created in each
                  of nine paintings. Profiles of the treated cracks were
                  monitored over a period ranging from five minutes to seventy
                  days. Only three of the treatments gave good results at
                  seventy days. The results were consistent with the known
                  viscoelastic properties of the materials used. A year later,
                  three paintings were keyed out in order to study the taut
                  condition, where cupping is driven by stress alignment rather
                  than curl, and to study the tendency of the repairs to
                  surface. In 2018–2019, the samples were reexamined. Surfacing
                  had become pronounced in many, but not all, of the samples
                  that had been keyed out: one treatment still looked good. In
                  this paper, the mechanisms causing cupping and surfacing are
                  modeled and the predictions compared to the experimental
                  results.

                  Single cracks or localized cracks in contemporary paintings on
                  canvas can be disfiguring due to cupping. A local treatment,
                  if successful, has the advantage of avoiding risks that a
                  whole painting treatment presents to the remainder of the
                  painting. Although cupping may be removed temporarily by
                  moisture, solvent vapors, and/or heat, maintaining flatness
                  may require reinforcements, which in turn, may surface.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  In 1999, we published a study of fourteen different methods
                  for local treatments of such cracks in slack paintings
                  ([[Hough and Michalski 1999]]). Here, we will discuss the
                  appearance of these treatments in paintings twenty-one years
                  later, with and without keying out (i.e., with both taut and
                  slack conditions).

                <p>
                  During curing, paint layers (which are “fatter” layers)
                  attempt to shrink more than ground layers (which are “lean”).
                  If a crack forms, and if the painting is slack, this
                  differential shrinkage curls the painting at the crack, as
                  shown in <a href="#fig-40-1"><strong>fig. 40.1a</strong></a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By combining equations from geometry with Timoshenko’s
                  equation for curvature of a two-layer laminate ([[Timoshenko
                  1925]]), we can derive the height of the curl in the
                  paint-ground laminate.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Height depends on the difference in shrinkages, the thickness
                  of the laminate (in this case, paint and ground), and the
                  width (w) of the region that is free to curl. The inset graph
                  of <a href="#fig-40-1"><strong>fig. 40.1</strong></a> shows
                  cupping height (y-axis) for various laminate thicknesses
                  (x-axis), for paintings where the paint layers are equal to,
                  or not more than a few times thicker than, the ground, and are
                  not especially soft compared to the ground.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  Plots are shown for a range of differential shrinkages, with
                  0.2% as a difference we can expect for an oil paint on a lean
                  ground, whether oil or acrylic.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  The blue circle marks the predicted curl for the model
                  paintings in this study. Much larger shrinkages due to severe
                  aging or solvent leaching will drive much larger curl.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The size layer is not considered in this model for curl
                  (equations for a three-layer system are beyond the scope of
                  this paper). However, one can expect shrinkage of the size
                  layer to counteract shrinkage of the paint layer, especially
                  at low humidities, but in Hough’s measurements of curl in the
                  experimental samples (see Profile Measurement below), curl
                  definitely increased with lower relative humidity (RH)
                  ([[Hough 2000|, fig. 11]]),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  showing that shrinkage of the paint layer dominated shrinkage
                  of the size layer. We can qualify this simple two-layer model
                  for curl, paint-ground, as an estimate of the maximum expected
                  curl.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Where the painting is cracked, the canvas acts as a hinge (see
                  <a href="#fig-40-1"><strong>fig. 40.1b</strong></a>). Curl is then limited by the surrounding area of painting
                  plus any overall tension in the painting. If the painting is
                  keyed out, the canvas hinge and the cupping are pulled toward
                  flatness, but this flattening reaches a limit when the canvas
                  hinge aligns with the center of the tension located in the
                  size, ground, and paint layers of the uncracked regions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  Cupping cannot be flattened beyond this limit no matter how
                  much tension is applied. This flattening limit h~align~ is
                  equal to at least half the combined thickness of canvas, size,
                  and ground (for low-stiffness paint) and at most half the
                  combined thickness of canvas, size, ground, and paint (for
                  high-stiffness paints). In
                  <a href="#fig-40-1"><strong>fig. 40.1b</strong></a>, the simplest situation has been assumed, where the red line
                  is in the middle of the size-ground-paint laminate.

                  If a reinforcement is added to the verso, and the painting has
                  zero tension, then the result of
                  <a href="#fig-40-2"><strong>fig. 40.2a</strong></a> is
                  plausible. In a painting with some tension (driven by keying
                  out, gravity, or low humidity) the reinforcement will surface
                  with a profile somewhere between the two extremes: a ridge if
                  the reinforcement behaves like a chain (<strong>fig. 40.2b</strong>), or a plateau if the reinforcement behaves like a plate (<a href="#fig-40-2"><strong>fig. 40.2c</strong></a>). Additional distortions may be superimposed if there is
                  differential swelling or shrinkage driven by heat,
                  plasticizer, solvents, moisture, or an adhesive.

                  The deformations of figures 41.1 and 41.2 are not static; they
                  can only be measured and understood within the framework of
                  viscoelastic mechanics; that is, one must consider time. Large
                  elastic deformations of paints can be accomplished in as
                  little as seconds when high temperature and plasticizer are
                  used, whereas at room temperature, large elastic movements
                  take months or years. On the one hand, trying to bend a paint
                  film quickly at room temperature will fracture it; on the
                  other hand, successfully flattened paint can recover the
                  memory of its old deformation over the course of months and
                  years. (For a theoretical background, see papers in these

                  To maintain flatness over the years, a reinforcement must
                  stress relax much more slowly than the paint layers. This
                  suggests that one should select either inorganic materials
                  (metal, glass) or highly cross-linked, filled polymers.

                <p>
                  Theoretically, the ideal solution to cupping at a crack would
                  be to repair the crack itself—to make a butt joint. It is,
                  unfortunately, extremely difficult in practice to make a butt
                  joint that is continuous, reliable, and invisible.

                  Preparation of Model Paintings
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The model paintings follow a technique often used by artists
                  from 1950s onward: oil paint on acrylic ground on cotton duck
                  fabric. One or more localized disfiguring cracks have often
                  been observed in such paintings. Nine paintings were prepared
                  on commercial stretchers, 61 x 168 cm (24 x 66 in.), in
                  landscape orientation. Two wide, vertical crossbars were
                  rigidly attached to the top and bottom stretcher bars, so that
                  tension could be released in the horizontal axis without
                  disturbing the vertical axis. The corners of the stretcher
                  were expanded 6&nbsp;mm in each direction prior to application of
                  the canvas, to permit slackening when needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After stretching the cotton duck, the perimeter was masked to
                  create a 7.6&nbsp;cm (3 in.) border of uncoated fabric. This
                  flexible border reduced tension in the painted area,
                  simulating the large slack paintings that were the focus of
                  the study. The cotton was coated with three layers of acrylic
                  ground, followed by six layers of lead white/zinc white oil
                  paint. The total thickness of the ground roughly equaled the
                  thickness of the paint. All layers were monitored by weight to
                  ensure uniform application.

                  Cracking and Heat Aging of Model Paintings
                </h3>
                <p>
                  To create multiple uniform cracks, a guillotine-like apparatus
                  was made. The apparatus and painting were kept in a cold room
                  at −5ºC (±2ºC) to ensure brittle, glassy behavior during
                  impact. The painting was placed face down over a narrow
                  trench, and the dull blade was dropped. The amount of
                  indentation was limited by an adjustable stop to avoid plastic
                  deformation. Nine 15&nbsp;cm (6 in.) cracks were created in each
                  painting, parallel to the short dimension and spaced evenly
                  along the long dimension. Fairly consistent, clean fractures
                  with very little distortion of the canvas were obtained.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The paintings were keyed in to slacken them in the direction
                  perpendicular to the cracks to facilitate curl. They were then
                  heat aged for nineteen days at 41°C to speed any curing and
                  relaxation processes prior to treatment (<a href="#fig-40-3"><strong>fig. 40.3</strong></a>).

                  Experimental Treatments
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Of the fourteen local treatments tested, one included moisture
                  and heat alone with no reinforcement; others included various
                  sizing or adhesive methods, and eight were variations on the
                  application of thin reinforcing strips adhered across the
                  crack verso. Two implausible treatments using rigid plates
                  applied to the crack verso were tested to establish baseline
                  “flatness” data. Some treatments were derived from those in
                  use at the time in the local treatment of cupped cracks or of
                  tears; others were experimental designs. Variation in the
                  resulting degree of stiffness was a main reason for choosing a
                  treatment to see its ability to hold the cupping flat.
                  Important also were the application from the verso, especially
                  for paintings with sensitive surfaces, and the ease of
                  removability of the added reinforcement. The treatments varied
                  in the location of the added element, the adhesive, the
                  reinforcement, or both, some of which have consequences for
                  surfacing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During treatment, the painting was placed face down, and each
                  crack was held flat for about thirty hours using a
                  purpose-built suction table. For most treatments (2–11), the
                  reinforcement was applied to the crack verso while the crack
                  was held flat under suction. Eight simple suction tables were
                  made to allow multiple treatments to be performed in one day,
                  since pressure needed to be maintained for drying or curing.

                <p>
                  All the strips of material used in treatments 4–11 were
                  fabricated so that their thickness was the same (0.50&nbsp;mm
                  ±0.05&nbsp;mm). This thickness was fixed by the stainless-steel
                  strips of treatment 4 (0.48&nbsp;mm). Width varied between 0.64&nbsp;mm
                  (stainless-steel strips) and 2&nbsp;mm. Various casting and molding
                  techniques were employed, and a micrometer was used to check
                  thicknesses. Strips 8 and 9 (wet treatments) were molded in
                  situ, with steel strips present as thickness gauges. All strip
                  treatments were applied across the crack verso and were spaced
                  at 3.2&nbsp;mm (1/8 in.) intervals, with alternating lengths of
                  25.4&nbsp;mm and 12.7&nbsp;mm (1 in., 1/2 in.), except treatment 8.
                  Verso images of some treatments are shown in

                  Details of each treatment are as follows. 1. Moisture, heat,
                  and flattening; no reinforcement. Moisture was applied to the
                  crack area at recto using damp, felted Gore-Tex for
                  twenty-four hours, followed by suction from recto and heat
                  from verso.

                  2. Acrylic plate, 3.2&nbsp;mm thick, applied to the canvas over a
                  wide area with 5-minute epoxy. This was a benchmark
                  reinforcement for experimental purposes, not a suggested
                  treatment for paintings.

                  14. Epoxy (EPO-TEK 301) flowed into the crack from the recto
                  to adhere the two fracture faces in a butt joint. Unlike in
                  treatments 1–13, suction was applied from the verso by a Mitka

                  In the first phase of the study, the profiles of each crack
                  were scanned using a mechanical scanner developed for this
                  project. The scanner provided a profile of a 20.5&nbsp;cm (8 in.)
                  line perpendicular to the center of the crack, with a
                  sensitivity of about 1µm in height. Unfortunately, over the
                  years the scanner had been discarded, so for the height
                  measurements at twenty-one years, we used calibrated raking
                  light photographs. Calibration was made using a 0.6&nbsp;mm leaf
                  from a feeler gauge, held firmly below each crack by magnets
                  behind the painting.

                  Taut Painting Condition
                </h3>
                <p>
                  A year after the first stage of the project ended, three
                  paintings that contained at least one of almost all the
                  treatments were keyed out in order to study the taut condition
                  where cupping is driven by stress alignment rather than curl,
                  and to study the tendency of the repairs to surface. To ensure
                  reproducible movement, a central crossbar was added to the
                  long dimension, with adjustable turnbuckles that controlled
                  tension perpendicular to the cracks (<a href="#fig-40-5"><strong>fig. 40.5</strong></a>). The arrangement of the nine cracks all in a row ensured
                  that even if carefully calibrated keying out did not yield
                  exactly the same tension across all paintings, at least within
                  each painting, samples would be subject to equal tension and
                  could be compared directly and reliably.

                  During the early monitoring of the cracked model paintings,
                  prior to any treatment, cupping increased after the tension
                  was released, exceeding the painting’s half thickness, thus
                  confirming curl as the dominant driving force ([[Hough and
                  Michalski 1999|, fig. 7]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the first seventy days, before any keying out, only
                  three of the treatments (4, 5, 6) were successful in terms of
                  visual appearance—rigid enough to hold the cupping down and
                  insubstantial enough not to create new distortions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After twenty-one years of being slack, only 4 and 5 remained
                  visually acceptable, and no surfacing was present (see
                  <a href="#fig-40-7"><strong>fig. 40.7</strong></a>, top row).
                </p>
                <p>
                  After twenty years of being taut (keyed out), many treatments
                  showed pronounced ridge surfacing (see
                  <a href="#fig-40-7"><strong>fig. 40.7</strong></a>, bottom row). Only 4 was successful: it held the cupping
                  almost flat but did not provoke plateau surfacing. One of the
                  treatment 4 samples is shown in
                  <a href="#fig-40-6"><strong>fig. 40.6</strong></a>, alongside other treatments as well as untreated cracks
                  within a single painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For treatment 8, the epoxy was allowed to set up for a period
                  before the suction was turned on. Despite this time allowance,
                  the suction pulled the epoxy into the crack face, partially
                  closing the crack and holding it flat intermittently—resulting
                  in a partial (inadvertent) butt joint. This is visible when
                  raking light comes from above, as in
                  <a href="#fig-40-7"><strong>fig. 40.7</strong></a>, bottom row: the crack has a stitched appearance and a
                  comb-like shadow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The cupping in the untreated cracks reached heights of ~0.7&nbsp;mm
                  in the slack paintings. In the keyed out paintings the cupping
                  reached only ~0.51&nbsp;mm, less than in the slack paintings, as
                  expected (see <a href="#fig-40-1"><strong>fig. 40.1</strong></a>). On the verso, the canvas has followed the curling paint
                  layers. No delamination was noticed in any of the samples.

                  The Final States of Treatments after Twenty-One Years
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In terms of the predictions of curl (see
                  <a href="#fig-40-1"><strong>fig. 40.1a</strong></a>), given the ~0.38&nbsp;mm thickness of paint and ground for the
                  model painting, assuming a region for unrestrained curl about
                  20&nbsp;mm wide on each side of the cracks, and assuming the
                  shrinkage differential between oil paint and acrylic ground of
                  ~0.2% estimated earlier, places the blue circle in the inset
                  graph of <a href="#fig-40-1"><strong>fig. 40.1</strong></a>, predicting a cupping height of ~1.6&nbsp;mm. The average cupping
                  height of untreated cracks in slack paintings, 0.68&nbsp;mm, is
                  less than half of this estimate, implying either that the
                  estimate of shrinkage is too high or, more likely, that the
                  canvas hinge (and perhaps the size) is restraining curl.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In terms of the predictions of stress alignment without
                  reinforcements (see
                  <a href="#fig-40-1"><strong>fig. 40.1b</strong></a>), given the thickness of the paint and ground, ~0.38&nbsp;mm, and
                  the canvas thickness of ~0.76&nbsp;mm, then by the equation of
                  <a href="#fig-40-1"><strong>fig. 40.1b</strong></a>, we expect untreated, heat/moisture-treated, or size-treated
                  cracks to have cupping height of ~0.57&nbsp;mm. Untreated cracks in
                  taut paintings (three samples) reached 0.51&nbsp;±0.02&nbsp;mm. If we
                  estimate that half the ground sank into the canvas weave, then
                  the prediction falls to ~0.52 mm, as observed. The cupping of
                  heat/moisture treatment (1) reached 0.45&nbsp;mm, 12% lower than
                  untreated cracks, while size treatments (12, 13) reached
                  0.35&nbsp;mm, 31% lower.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Keying out created ridge-shaped surfacing in all treatments
                  that used reinforcements, except treatment 4, the steel; that
                  is, all polymer reinforcements and the glass bundles embedded
                  in a polymer bent at the crack, thus creating a ridge, as
                  shown in <a href="#fig-40-2"><strong>fig. 40.2b</strong></a>. Keying out generated consistent ridging heights: worsening
                  treatments that did well when slack (except treatment 4),
                  while improving treatments that had maximum curl when slack.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Both the ridge surfacing caused by reinforcements under
                  tension and the moating<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  caused by size treatments, were precisely aligned with their
                  location on the back of the canvas. There was no complex
                  extension of visible deformation beyond the boundaries of the
                  verso treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In terms of the predictions of surfacing of reinforcements
                  (see
                  <strong><a href="#fig-40-2">figs. 40.2b</a> and
                    <a href="#fig-40-2">40.2c</a></strong>), given the thickness of all reinforcements of 0.50
                  ±0.05&nbsp;mm, and the paint, ground, and canvas thicknesses
                  specified earlier, we expect the height of surfacing to be
                  ~1.2&nbsp;mm (only ridge surfacing was observed). Heights for
                  reinforced treatments using polymers (6, 8) ranged between
                  0.35&nbsp;mm and 0.30&nbsp;mm, respectively (see
                  <a href="#fig-40-8"><strong>fig. 40.8</strong></a>, top right). The glass fiber reinforcement (5), while
                  successful in a slack painting, surfaced as much as the
                  polymer reinforcements when taut: 0.35&nbsp;mm. None of the ridge
                  surfacing of reinforcements reached the prediction of stress
                  alignment; all remained at or below 0.45&nbsp;mm, about a third of
                  our prediction. This suggests that the treatments, although
                  visually unacceptable, had functioned to some extent as
                  intended. From another perspective, it suggests that the
                  tension applied by the keying out was not severe enough to
                  achieve maximum surfacing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only one mystery remained: since the stainless-steel strips,
                  treatment 4, did not bend at the crack, why did they not
                  surface as a plateau instead? The simplest answer is that the
                  amount of tension we provided by keying out was not enough to
                  bend the paint and ground into the S shape required at each
                  edge of the surfacing plateau of
                  <a href="#fig-40-2"><strong>fig. 40.2c</strong></a>. This is consistent with the conclusion that the tension in
                  the keyed-out paintings, while enough to drive some ridge
                  surfacing of polymer reinforcements, was not enough to drive
                  the maximum predicted. In other words, the keyed-out paintings
                  were tight enough to cause ridge surfacing of flexible
                  reinforcements, but not sufficient to cause noticeable plateau
                  surfacing. Unfortunately, the raking light measurement method
                  did not show small, gradual profile changes that more
                  sensitive scanning might have detected. Perhaps our
                  expectations of plateau surfacing were biased by observation
                  of old patches that employed generous amounts of glue. These
                  generate huge forces during low humidity, independently of
                  keying out, and are much thicker than the reinforcements we
                  used.

                  The Viscoelastic Response over Time

                  In the left graph of
                  <a href="#fig-40-8"><strong>fig. 40.8</strong></a>, we can follow the viscoelastic behavior of the treatments
                  that were never keyed out, starting at 5 minutes after they
                  were released from the suction table up to 21 years later.
                  This type of graph—the logarithm of an elastic measurement
                  versus the logarithm of time (a log-log plot)—is conventional
                  in viscoelastic studies of polymers, because it can be placed
                  in the context of master curves, as described elsewhere in
                  these proceedings by [Daly Hartin et
                  al.](file:///Users/rbarth/Desktop/Finalized%20files-Conserving-Canvas–72122-to%20prep%20for%20TR/41-Hough%20Michalski/paper-19)

                  The heavy gray line at top left of
                  <a href="#fig-40-8"><strong>fig. 40.8</strong></a> shows the
                  slope of the master curve for stress relaxation of oil
                  paintings measured by Daly Hartin et al. for the range of 5
                  minutes to 100 years, which was 1/13, that is, 1 log unit in
                  height for each 13 log units of time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  The overall slope of the treatments that failed (that allowed
                  the cupping to return) is similar to this slope. Even sized
                  samples with a rapid increase in cupping in the first few
                  hours followed by a striking decrease that lasted several
                  months (treatments 10, 11, 12, 13), did return over the years
                  to an overall slope of ~1/13, if one simply considers the
                  first and last data points.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Treatment 1 (heat and moisture) also shows a small wobble in
                  its plot, though not as pronounced as that of the sizes. This
                  plateau between a few days and a few months led us to believe
                  in our 1999 paper that this was a final plateau, but over the
                  last twenty-one years, it has returned to its initial rate of
                  climb and reaches just short of completely untreated cracks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The spread in the 5-minute data points shows the diminishing
                  springback of cupping immediately<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  after the suction pressure was released. As expected, heat and
                  moisture without reinforcement (treatment 1), has the largest
                  springback, about one-third of the twenty-one-year cupping; by
                  the first month, the second third recovers. Treatment 9
                  behaves similarly—demonstrating that a non–crosslinked polymer
                  with a low glass transition temperature, such as the PVA (Jade
                  403), offers negligible resistance. The benefits, if any, of
                  such treatments are transitory. Remaining 5-minute data points
                  are in the expected order of increasing stiffness and less
                  springback: polymer, then glass, then metal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since glass fibers (treatment 5) do not relax, the epoxy
                  matrix binding them must have relaxed by shearing between
                  filaments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The difference between treatments 6 and 7 shows the benefits
                  of heat-curing the epoxy to decrease its relaxation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The butt joint (treatment 14), although not perfect in
                  adhesion, kept the cupping at around a quarter of untreated
                  heights throughout the duration, while climbing at the master
                  slope of ~1/13.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The benchmark plate treatment (2), which within experimental
                  error can be considered a flat line, demonstrated that it is
                  possible to hold the cupping completely flat with a thermoset
                  adhesive that soaks into the canvas and is cemented to a thick
                  rigid plate. It also established that the suction table could
                  hold the cupping flat to within 0.025&nbsp;mm on all treatments
                  prior to release of the suction. The thin aluminum foil
                  treatment (3) did not appear to bend either, but it did allow
                  small cupping to emerge over the twenty-one years, as did
                  treatments 4 and 5. All three showed very slow climbs towards
                  a similar, nondisturbing height at twenty-one years. These
                  cuppings are extremely low and narrow, and although the canvas
                  could easily be seen to follow the large deformations of
                  unsuccessful treatments, it was not possible to determine if
                  the back of the canvas had followed exactly these very small
                  deformations. A cupping height of 0.06&nbsp;mm is only 8% of the
                  thickness of the canvas (0.76&nbsp;mm) so a slight bulging of the
                  canvas threads would be enough to allow this curl of paint,
                  and even if Beva entered the threads, as a thermoplastic it
                  could certainly flow over the decades, allowing the canvas to
                  bulge.

                      Surfacing of local reinforcements is driven by tension in
                      the painting. Ridge surfacing of flexible reinforcements
                      occurs at lower tension than plateau surfacing of rigid

                      Keeping the first two conclusions in mind, good results
                      are possible if the reinforcement, such as metal, does not
                      stress relax, if it is thin, such as very thin
                      stainless-steel strips (treatment 4), if it is spaced and
                      feathered, and finally, if the painting is under only
                      moderate tension.

                      The neatest theoretical solution to both cupping and
                      surfacing would be to adhere the fracture faces in a butt
                      joint. Treatment 14 showed moderately good control of
                      cupping. This treatment may eventually fail, but at least
                      it will never surface. For this reason alone, more study
                      of this option is warranted.

                      Data on samples before treatment showed that low RH
                      substantially increases curl ([[Hough 2000]]). Low RH also
                      drives overall tension in a painting. Therefore, low RH
                      will drive curl in slack paintings and surfacing in taut
                      paintings.

                      The slow return of cupping over time is the result of
                      viscoelastic phenomena that are consistent with the master
                      curves for paintings presented by other authors in these
                      proceedings.

                      In taut paintings, cupping of untreated cracks or
                      treatments not using reinforcements was consistent with
                      the model predictions for stress alignment.

                      In taut paintings, ridge surfacing of reinforced paintings
                      was less than the maximum predicted, indicating that all
                      reinforcements resisted bending to some degree at the
                      level of tension used.

                        <em>Surfacing</em> refers to the development at the
                        surface of a painting of a deformation that corresponds
                        to the shape of a local repair applied to the verso of
                        the painting, such as a patch.

                        Timoshenko derived the curvature of any two-layer
                        laminate with differential shrinkage. If the
                        differential shrinkage is (ε~1−~ε~2~), m is the ratio of
                        the two thicknesses, n is the ratio of the two moduli of
                        elasticity, and t is the laminate thickness, then radius
                        of curvature is
                        R=(t*(3*(1+m)^2+(1+m*n)*(m^2+1/(m*n))))/(6*(ε~1−~ε~2~)*(1+m)^2).
                        The height h of the arc over a base of w and curvature R
                        is h=R-(R^2-w^2). See [<a href="#about-blank">https://www.mathopenref.com/sagitta.html</a>.] <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a>

                        Curing shrinkage of linseed oil was suggested as a
                        contributor to paint failure as early as 1929 ([[Clark
                        and Tschentke 1929]]). Pure medium with driers, cured in
                        the dark, shrank 1% to 1.6% by volume, so 0.3%–0.5% in
                        length. A paint of 35% pigment volume concentration
                        (PVC) would experience ~65% of pure oil values, so
                        ~0.2–0.3%. A ground at critical PVC would shrink
                        negligibly in comparison. Browne reported dimensional
                        change for films of linseed oil paints after they were
                        released from the casting substrate and exposed to
                        cycles of high relative humidity ([[Browne 1955]]).
                        Michalski plotted the nonrecoverable shrinkage from
                        Browne’s data: ~0.3% for an oil paint of 30% PVC,
                        consistent with Clark and Tschentke ([[Michalski 1991|,
                        n25]]).

                        Since the RH in the room where cupping was measured
                        varied gradually over the course of the study, all
                        cupping heights prior to treatment were plotted versus
                        RH in order to derive a correction factor to normalize
                        results to 50%&nbsp;RH. The factor was 2.1% height increase
                        per 1%&nbsp;RH drop, for example, 21% height increase when RH
                        is reduced from 50%&nbsp;to 40%&nbsp;RH (slack paintings).

                        in an unpublished report by Marion Mecklenburg. His
                        original term was “force realignment” ([[Mecklenburg

                  This short article compiles preliminary findings from an
                  ongoing survey of wax-resin lining treatments performed at
                  Brooklyn Museum (BkM) from 1936 through 1985. BkM’s
                  Conservation Department was established in 1934 with the hire
                  of Sheldon Keck and is among the oldest in the United States.
                  BkM holds both the paintings and the associated conservation
                  records for a wide range of canvases treated by Keck, his wife
                  Caroline, and their protégés; researching this collection has
                  the potential to reveal much about the broader
                  twentieth-century American lining movement. It is estimated
                  that 20%–25% of the canvas paintings in BkM’s collection have
                  been wax-resin lined. Lining trends identified within the
                  collection, reasons for lining, and adhesive recipes used at
                  BkM are discussed. Initial survey results challenged some of
                  the authors’ preconceptions about historic lining practices at
                  the museum. At the time of publication, nearly half of the
                  conservation files had been evaluated.

                <p>
                  Motivated by an interest in past treatment techniques and a
                  desire to put current Brooklyn Museum (BkM) projects into an
                  historic context, BkM Conservators are endeavoring to build an
                  internal database of wax-resin linings through a comprehensive
                  survey of the paintings collection. Using both the
                  conservation records and the paintings themselves, the project
                  aims to reconstruct the history of wax-resin lining practices
                  at BkM. The authors not only seek to identify trends in lining
                  application but also to evaluate the decision-making process
                  behind individual treatments and to assess how they have aged.
                  Because lining materials and techniques have implications for
                  collection care, another goal is to develop a framework that
                  will enable the adhesive recipe to be characterized if only
                  the conservator or date of execution is known, aiding in the
                  establishment of markers for paintings that may warrant
                  condition monitoring. This poster presents an overview of the
                  project and considers preliminary findings from the ongoing
                  survey.

                <h2 id="history" tabindex="-1">History</h2>
                <p>
                  Founded in 1934 with the hire of Sheldon Keck as restorer, the
                  BkM Conservation Department is among the oldest in the United
                  States and was the first established within a New York City
                  institution. The department, which has continuously employed a
                  paintings conservator, holds documentation for a wide range of
                  canvases treated by Keck, his wife, Caroline, who was also an
                  accomplished conservator, and their successors. Researching
                  the BkM conservation records together with the associated
                  paintings has the potential to reveal a great deal about both
                  the approaches to wax-resin lining at the museum and the
                  broader twentieth-century American lining movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Documentation has been integral to conservation practice at
                  BkM since the beginning. Although reports have become more
                  nuanced over time, many early records were abbreviated, rarely
                  elaborating on the treatment rationale or describing the
                  materials and techniques in a way that would allow the
                  processes to be reproduced. Often reports were unsigned,
                  recipe components were not itemized or quantified, and
                  procedures were summarized using undefined terms (such as “the
                  Dutch method” for lining preparations). With a few notable
                  exceptions, this lack of detail presents challenges in
                  understanding the relationship between current condition
                  issues and previous treatments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Archival research has provided valuable insights into BkM
                  treatment methods absent in the documentation. In 1954 and
                  1962, Sheldon and Caroline produced two films for a general
                  audience, both of which illustrate the complex operation of
                  performing a wax-resin lining. The earlier film features a
                  lining executed with a hand iron (<a href="#fig-41-1"><strong>fig. 41.1</strong></a>) ([[Keck and Keck 1954]]), and in the later one,
                  conservators demonstrate the use of a vacuum hot table (<a href="#fig-41-2"><strong>fig. 41.2</strong></a>) ([[Keck and Keck 1962]]). In both films, the narration
                  illuminates the reasoning behind each action and material
                  selected. The filmed processes are remarkably consistent with
                  physical evidence of lining observed on many paintings in the
                  collection, such as paper residues on the tacking margins or
                  brush marks and fingerprints on the versos of paintings lined
                  by hand.

                <h2 id="methodology" tabindex="-1">Methodology</h2>
                <p>
                  BkM conservation records are kept as paper files and digital
                  assets on The Museum System (TMS) database. The survey to
                  identify wax-resin lined paintings began in 2018 and has
                  advanced according to the paper folder organization system,
                  progressing alphabetically by artist’s surname. An Excel
                  spreadsheet was developed to track progress and standardize
                  information gleaned from the records. At the time of
                  publication, over half of the approximately two thousand
                  painting conservation files had been evaluated, around 80% of
                  which pertain to paintings on canvas. The findings presented
                  here derive from the initial sample set of paintings by
                  artists who have surnames starting with <em>A</em> through
                  <em>M.</em>

                  Preliminary Findings
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Wax-resin linings were performed at BkM over a nearly
                  fifty-year period from 1936 through the mid-1980s,
                  encompassing the rise and fall of the technique’s popularity
                  in the United States. Based on the records reviewed to date,
                  the authors hypothesize that 20%–25% of the canvas paintings
                  in the BkM collection are wax-resin lined. The earliest
                  linings were primarily done on paintings that had been in the
                  collection for decades. The institution, with roots dating
                  back to 1823, had been collecting paintings for nearly a
                  hundred years before employing a conservator. In his first
                  years on the job, Keck may have encountered a backlog of
                  paintings in unstable condition that he judged to be in need
                  of lining. The data appears to suggest that, starting in the
                  1940s, many paintings were lined as they were acquired. This
                  trend is consistent with the developing role of the
                  conservator within the museum. Annual reports from 1938 onward
                  emphasize the practice of examining all artwork considered for
                  acquisition “to make sure of their good condition and
                  authenticity” ([[Brooklyn Museum 1940|, 23]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most of the paintings wax-resin lined at BkM were between
                  fifty and 125 years old at the time of lining (<a href="#fig-41-3"><strong>fig. 41.3</strong></a>), including paintings from the early nineteenth century
                  through the 1930s. Few paintings predating the nineteenth
                  century were lined at BkM, which likely reflects the strength
                  of BkM collection holdings in certain areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fluctuations in the number of linings performed each year may
                  correspond with significant events (<a href="#fig-41-4"><strong>fig. 41.4</strong></a>). Keck performed the first wax-resin lining on record at BkM
                  in 1936, two years after he was hired.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  This initial delay may relate to setting up a new laboratory
                  rather than a concerted effort on his part. In 1943, Keck left
                  to serve in World War II as one of the Monuments Men in the
                  U.S. Army’s Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Program
                  ([[Monuments Men Foundation n.d.]]). Few paintings were lined
                  until Caroline assumed his museum duties and resumed the
                  practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some variations in lining frequency may be linked to new
                  technology, such as the vacuum hot table acquired in 1961,
                  and/or staffing changes that occurred in the department over
                  the decades. The apparent increase in numbers observed in the
                  late 1970s and early 1980s warrants further investigation,
                  considering the critical attitudes against lining that
                  developed in the field of conservation at this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most common motivations given for lining include a
                  “cupped” or “cracked” paint film; a “dry,” “brittle,” or
                  “slack” canvas; and the failure of an old glue-paste lining.
                  Significantly, not all paintings called to the laboratory were
                  lined as a matter of course; many underwent less invasive
                  treatments or were left untouched. This was sometimes
                  attributed to lack of time, but also occurred if it was
                  determined that no intervention was required, particularly in
                  cases where a stable lining was already present.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There were significant periods when adhesive components were
                  not listed each time a lining was performed (<a href="#fig-41-5"><strong>fig. 41.5</strong></a>). The earliest reports, dated 1936–1940, reliably include
                  the same formula of 60 parts beeswax, 35 parts dammar resin,
                  and 5 parts Canada balsam. In 1941, the terms
                  <em>wax-resin</em> or <em>wax</em> were used alone, without
                  specifying components. Reports from 1942–1944 contain a
                  similar recipe to the earlier one, with slightly different
                  proportions: 65 parts beeswax, 30 parts dammar resin, and 5
                  parts Canada balsam. The term <em>wax-resin</em> predominates
                  again from 1945 to 1946, and from 1961 onward. These trends
                  indicate that generic language was common once the same
                  formula had been used for a while, with little variation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Starting in 1949, Multiwax W-835 was added to some wax-resin
                  mixtures, marking the beginning of an experimental period with
                  different materials, which included microcrystalline wax, gum
                  elemi, and turpentine. On occasion, current or former trainees
                  lined paintings at BkM using distinctive recipes. In the early
                  1950s, Louis Pomerantz treated at least one painting as a
                  student volunteer using 6 parts beeswax, 6 parts Multiwax
                  W-835, 6 parts dammar resin, and 1 part Canada balsam.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  In 1971–72, BkM contracted Bernard Rabin, who used an adhesive
                  made from 3 pounds unbleached beeswax, 5.5 pounds Multiwax
                  W-445, 1 1/2 pounds Piccolyte S-85, and 2 pounds dammar
                  resin.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  References to “Bernard Rabin’s wax-resin mixture” appear in
                  later reports, suggesting his 1971–72 formula was reused.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The majority (approximately 80%) of the linings assessed to
                  date remain stable and have not required later treatment to
                  address adhesion failure or other structural issues. Some
                  exhibit local delamination along the tacking margins or around
                  the perimeter of the picture plane. Surface residues, likely
                  wax-resin and/or facing adhesives, have been found on many
                  paintings, suggesting inadequate clearance was common.

                  Conclusions and Future Steps
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Preliminary findings challenged preconceptions about historic
                  BkM lining practices. Prior to starting this project, the
                  authors assumed a majority of canvas paintings at BkM were
                  wax-resin lined and that paintings routinely underwent lining
                  treatments as a preventive measure, regardless of their
                  condition. The survey has revealed what seems to be a more
                  discerning and varied approach. Decisions over whether or not
                  to line a painting appear to have been carefully weighed, even
                  if the rationale was not described.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upon completion of the survey, the influence of BkM collecting
                  and exhibition practices on lining treatments will be
                  evaluated. Further consideration will be given to age at the
                  time of lining to determine if the treatment approach differed
                  between newer paintings and those that had been through the
                  restoration cycle many times. Data regarding the replacement
                  or reuse of auxiliary supports and the method of canvas
                  attachment is also being gathered with the intent to link
                  individual conservators with idiosyncratic techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The authors hope to inspire similar studies of wax-resin lined
                  paintings in other collections, creating the potential to
                  trace the exchange of lining materials and techniques across
                  laboratories.

                  The 1974 Greenwich conference participants reviewed both past
                  and current techniques of lining paintings with adhesives such
                  as flour paste, animal glue, wax-resin, Beva 371, and Plextol
                  B500, using hand irons, hot tables, vacuum pressure,
                  low-pressure suction tables, and vacuum envelopes. They also
                  discussed declaring a moratorium on lining.

                  In 2017, in the article that provided the subtitle for this
                  paper, David Bomford wrote the following with 20/20 hindsight:

                <p>
                  The [1974] Greenwich Lining Conference had two profound and
                  contradictory effects, one immediate and practical, the other
                  philosophical and slow-burning. The first was to open the eyes
                  of many of those present to the advances in the technology of
                  lining, including machinery and materials . . . The second
                  effect was to set in motion something quite different—a debate
                  that questioned the whole basis of lining. Westby
                  Percival-Prescott’s keynote “The Lining Cycle” conjured up a
                  graphic picture of the spiral of repeated treatment,
                  deterioration, and re-treatment in which canvas paintings
                  become trapped once they are lined for the first time.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  Westby Percival-Prescott (1923–2005) (<a href="#fig-42-1"><strong>fig. 42.1</strong></a>) was a major force in bringing about the reexamination of
                  traditional structural treatments. Delegates from twenty-four
                  countries were present at the conference he organized at
                  Greenwich, London, in 1974. From 1975 to 1978
                  Percival-Prescott served as coordinator of the Lining and
                  Stretchers Working Group of the International Council of
                  Museums&nbsp;– Committee for Conservation (ICOM-CC); the group’s
                  name changed to Structural Restoration of Canvas Paintings in
                  1978, at which point Percival-Prescott became co-coordinator
                  with Pierre Boissonas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1975, Percival-Prescott reported that the lectures and/or
                  demonstrations at Greenwich fell into three main categories
                  ([[Percival-Prescott 1975]]). The first was traditional
                  hand-linings: Russian sturgeon glue; Italian flour paste and
                  animal glue; British “compo” glue; Belgian and Polish natural
                  beeswax and resin; and National Gallery, London hand lining.
                  The second was hot-table linings: Swiss Lascaux synthetic wax
                  on fiberglass fabric, vacuum hot tables, and Beva. The third
                  category was dubbed “new alternatives” and included Courtauld
                  vacuum envelopes using wax resin; Berger vacuum envelopes
                  using the verso of the painting as the top of the envelope;
                  Mehra’s prototype cold vacuum lining table and Plextol B500;
                  and how to prevent the need for lining at all.

                  In the United States, we quickly heard about a “moratorium on
                  lining.” As Gillian Lewis told me:
                </p>
                <p>
                  A call for a moratorium was made by Westby at the closing
                  address at the end of the Greenwich conference. There was a
                  show of hands—mostly in favor. It took us all by surprise and
                  appeared impromptu, but in fact he had been pondering it for
                  some years and had talked informally to several people about
                  it. I think he kept quiet about it until the conference itself
                  had taken place, as he anticipated that some contributors
                  might not be so open in their descriptions of techniques had
                  they known this could be the outcome.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Suddenly, as a professor of paintings conservation in the
                  1970s, I had to be ready to teach many more lining techniques
                  than I had learned in the 1960s. At Greenwich, Gerry Hedley
                  (1949–1990), Stephen Hackney, and Alan Cummings delivered
                  “Lining in a Vacuum Envelope with a Traversing Infrared Heat
                  Source,” and Cummings and Hedley delivered “Surface Texture
                  Changes in Vacuum Lining: Experiments with Raw Canvas.” Alan
                  Cummings described the experience in his FAIC interview:
                </p>
                <p>
                  We became a kind of three musketeers: myself, Gerry Hedley,
                  and Stephen Hackney. We were all at Courtauld at the same
                  time. Our particular interest was in the structural treatment
                  of canvas paintings in lining. I did my final-year research
                  project at Courtauld on texture changing and vacuum lining of
                  paintings. We gave the papers at the lining conference in
                  1974. I think that whole conference was quite significant,
                  including the colorful character Gustav Berger, the birth of
                  Beva, and Vishwa Mehra. All of the debates about vacuum lining
                  versus other kinds of lining. Yeah, it was a very significant
                  period.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Stephen Hackney talked about the vacuum envelope experiment in
                  his FAIC interview:
                </p>
                <p>
                  Professor [Stephen] Rees Jones had originally given me a
                  project, essentially to rebuild and get the old hot table
                  working again and to give the department the capability of
                  doing wax linings. It started as a technical challenge with
                  machinery, no budget, and cramped conditions. Gerry Hedley
                  then joined me and brought his mechanical engineering talents,
                  and we started doing some radical work, deconstructing the
                  whole process of wax lining, especially the use of vacuum.
                  Westby, Gillian, and Ronald Chittenden [all from the Greenwich
                  Maritime Museum] came to visit us more than once.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1993, Hackney wrote about Hedley’s contributions (<a href="#fig-42-2"><strong>fig. 42.2</strong></a>):
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was clear that there was little fundamental understanding
                  of the properties of materials used in paintings and their
                  conservation. The complex structure of an old stretched canvas
                  painting had not been considered from an engineering
                  standpoint. As a consequence, at the Greenwich lining
                  conference some very strong contradictory opinions were
                  expressed. It was Gerry’s gift that he could quickly analyze
                  an argument and identify its premises, frequently enabling him
                  to resolve a dispute or misunderstanding. ([[Hackney 1993|,
                  4]])

                  Turning to the contributions from the Italian delegation,
                  Andrea Rothe (1936–2018) (<a href="#fig-42-3"><strong>fig. 42.3</strong></a>) had translated and delivered in English the paper by
                  Umberto Baldini and Sergio Taiti, “Italian Lining Techniques:
                  Lining with Pasta Adhesive (and Other Methods) at the Fortezza
                  da Basso, Florence.” He gave me the history in his FAIC
                  interview.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I had been doing only <em>pasta</em> linings. A little wax
                  lining every now and then. In 1974, I gave the talk [on
                  Italian lining], and I answered questions. I got so carried
                  away I fell off the stage and fell into the people sitting on
                  the first row. I didn’t fall very far. It wasn’t a high stage,
                  but it was sort of embarrassing. After that, everybody knew me
                  as the guy who had fallen off the stage . . . It was a very
                  useful conference. From what I’ve seen afterwards, no other
                  conferences really had the quality of that lining conference.
                  There was a lot going on: Mehra with his technique, Gustav
                  with his wife—she kept giving him instructions. John Brealey
                  says he met me in Greenwich.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  John Brealey (1925–2002) chaired a panel at Greenwich and
                  mounted a photographic display of his treatments of the nine
                  huge (nine-foot square) paintings on canvas by Mantegna in
                  Hampton Court, a series known as The Triumphs of Caesar.
                  Commissioned in 1484, they were “very thinly painted, on fine
                  linen, with practically no ground&nbsp;… like gouache.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  They were overpainted in oil in the eighteenth century and
                  again with oil by Roger Fry in the nineteenth, and then wax
                  lined in the 1930s by Stanley Kennedy-North (1887–1942), who
                  used 15-pound irons that created “welts” in the paintings. In
                  interviews and lectures, Brealey told our students about
                  removing a “ton” of wax.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  His treatments took more than nine years. Brealey spoke
                  against wax lining in his interviews and celebrated unlined
                  paintings in his lectures. For a time, Brealey supported
                  Robert Fieux’s research and Fabri-Sil lining (more on this
                  shortly).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beva 371 (Berger’s ethylene vinyl acetate) was first
                  formulated in 1970 and presented at the International
                  Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works’
                  Congress in Lisbon in 1972. Two years later, Gustav Berger
                  (1920–2006) presented demonstrations, a film, and four papers
                  at Greenwich: “Effects of Consolidation Measures on Fibrous
                  Materials,” “Wax Impregnation of Cellulose: An Irreversible
                  Process,” “Lining of a Torn Painting with BEVA 371,” and “Some
                  Effects of Impregnating Adhesives on Paint Film.” Only a
                  decade later, in 1984, Gerry Hedley received 93 replies to his
                  international questionnaire on lining, and Beva 371 was found
                  to be the most widely used lining adhesive ([[Hedley and
                  Villers 1984]]).
                </p>
                <p>In his 1995 FAIC interview, Berger noted:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The movement against lining is foolish. I have shown,
                    through my experiments and lining demonstrations, that I can
                    line butterflies. For if you can line a butterfly, then
                    really I don’t think you would damage a painting when you
                    line it. So paintings can be lined without damaging them.
                    You only have to know how, and to do it properly, and have
                    the right materials.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Berger had the verso of the butterfly collage on canvas serve
                  as the top of the vacuum envelope.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1976 he told me, “There is another little thing that I
                  developed … that you can use the painting itself as a membrane
                  and reline it without any pressure from the top.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  During the opening session in Greenwich, <em>The Guitar</em>,
                  a freshly painted collage, oil, and mixed media work on primed
                  canvas by Raphael Berger, with high impasto and preserved
                  butterfly specimens, was lined in a public demonstration. The
                  lining left the high impasto and the butterflies intact
                  ([[Berger and Russell 2000|, 35]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  New terminology and key personalities emerged at Greenwich.
                  Caroline Villers noted that Berger coined the term
                  <em>weave interference</em> ([[Villers 2003a|, v]]), while
                  Percival-Prescott had invented the portmanteau
                  <em>shrinkle</em> to describe what happens when moisture
                  causes the canvas to shrink and the paint to wrinkle. I was
                  among the many audience members over the following years who
                  were treated to conference talks featuring Gustav Berger at
                  the podium while his wife, Mira, moved up and down the aisles
                  passing out squares of Kleenex tissue “lined” with other
                  squares of Kleenex using Beva 371 (with no resultant
                  staining). Mira would sometime call out instructions from the
                  back of the auditorium: “No, no, Gustav—wrong slide!” (<a href="#fig-42-4"><strong>fig. 42.4</strong></a>).

                <p>
                  In ICOM-CC’s 1972 triennial meeting, in Madrid, Vishwa Raj
                  Mehra (b. 1931) had presented a radical review of lining
                  methodology, in which he began to argue for a more graduated
                  approach to structural treatment and to question assumptions
                  about the cohesive strength required of lining adhesives and
                  the tensile forces in the painting composite.
                  Percival-Prescott wrote in 2003:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The atmosphere in the Greenwich Conference will never be
                    forgotten and led to many substantial developments&nbsp;… One of
                    the greatest of these was Vishwa Mehra’s low-pressure cold
                    table; this invention took its place in lining history and
                    was to be copied extensively throughout the world, including
                    for use with paper and textile conservation. Mehra had
                    brought a prototype lining table, transported specially to
                    the conference in order to demonstrate lining with Plextol
                    B500 cold-setting adhesive and woven polypropylene fabric.

                  Robert Fieux (1919–1991) (<a href="#fig-42-5"><strong>fig. 42.5</strong></a>) presented a paper at Greenwich reporting on a meeting in
                  Cooperstown, New York, in summer 1973, hosted by Sheldon and
                  Caroline Keck, comparing wax resin, glue paste, Beva, and
                  polyvinyl acetate. Fieux gave papers in Ottawa 1976 and at
                  ICOM-CC 1978, in Zagreb, on “Electrostatic Cling as a Pressure
                  Source in Lining of Paintings.” He invented Fabri-Sil linings:
                  silicone adhesive on Teflon-coated fiberglass fabric, which
                  required only gentle hand pressure for attachment. This
                  seemingly gentle technique was adopted at New York’s
                  Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, for a
                  time, but was later abandoned.

                  During treatment of Francesco Bassano’s
                  <em>Adoration of the Shepherds</em> (Arkansas Arts Center),
                  the painting was found to have been lined to a very open-weave
                  canvas using glue-paste adhesive. Further research revealed
                  this to be an Italian lining technique, likely applied before
                  the painting’s acquisition by the Kress Foundation in the
                  1930s. This poster explores the differences between Florentine
                  and Roman lining techniques, proposing that the lining applied
                  to the Bassano is Roman. It also provides an overview of the
                  Roman lining method, and ultimately identifies the type of
                  canvas used on the Bassano.

                <p>
                  In the fall of 2018, the Arkansas Arts Center’s
                  <em>Adoration of the Shepherds,</em> attributed to Francesco
                  Bassano (<a href="#fig-43-1"><strong>fig. 43.1</strong></a>), was brought to New York University’s Conservation Center
                  for treatment. The painting is part of the dispersed Kress
                  Collection, and had not been studied since 1932, when it was
                  restored by then-conservator of the Kress Collection, Stephen
                  Pichetto.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  During treatment at the Conservation Center, it was revealed
                  the painting had been lined with a very open-weave canvas (<a href="#fig-43-2"><strong>fig. 43.2</strong></a>). This was an unusual discovery, as canvas paintings treated
                  by the Kress Foundation during this period were often lined
                  after acquisition with tightly woven canvases.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Additionally, there were no notes in the Kress Foundation
                  Archive that discussed the addition of a lining. So where was
                  it applied?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The lining has several characteristics that point to an
                  Italian method of canvas lining. Although the original canvas
                  has a fine weave, approximately 30 x 30 threads per inch, the
                  lining has a very open, plain weave with approximately 16 x 16
                  threads per inch. The canvas is composed of threads with
                  irregular widths, and the lining overall was adhered with a
                  thin layer of glue-paste adhesive (<a href="#fig-43-3"><strong>fig. 43.3</strong></a>). Clues from the painting’s provenance were quite limited,
                  leading back only to the dealer who sold it to the Kress
                  Foundation in 1930; this was Florentine dealer Count
                  Alessandro Contini-Bonacossi, who supplied many paintings to
                  Samuel H. Kress ([[Shapley 1973]]). It is therefore likely the
                  lining was applied in Italy before the painting was sold,
                  though it is unknown where it might have been done, or by
                  whom.

                  Roman versus Florentine Lining Canvases
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In Italy, there are two traditional glue-paste lining methods:
                  Florentine and Roman. This distinction originates from the
                  work of two nineteenth-century Italian restorers: Count
                  Giovanni Secco-Suardo and Ulisse Forni. The glue-paste recipe
                  and lining techniques advocated by Secco-Suardo informed the
                  Florentine technique, whereas Forni’s became the basis for the
                  Roman technique ([[Forni 1866]]; [[Reifsnyder 1995|,
                  77–78]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  A characteristic difference often cited between these
                  approaches is the glue-paste recipes;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  however, there is also a large variation in the types of
                  lining canvas chosen. While both methods generally employ
                  plain weave hemp and/or flax-based canvases, their weave
                  densities differ greatly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Typically, the Florentine method uses a tighter weave, similar
                  to the original canvas, though slightly more robust, to
                  support the painting ([[Reifsnyder 1995|, 79})}.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  This type of canvas is chosen to provide a more rigid support
                  and minimize weave interference ([[Baldini and Taiti 2003|,
                  116]]). The Roman technique, in contrast, uses an open weave.
                  There are two main types of this open-weave canvas: the more
                  open <em>tela patta,</em> at 10–15 threads per inch, and the
                  slightly more dense <em>tela pattina,</em> at 20–25 threads
                  per inch. Selection of either the <em>tela patta</em> or
                  <em>tela pattina</em> largely depends on the size of the
                  painting, the structure of the original canvas, and the
                  painting’s condition ([[Laroche and Saccarello 1996|, 13]]).
                  Generally, this type of canvas allows for a lighter, more
                  flexible support after lining; however, the overall
                  flexibility is also highly dependent on the glue-paste recipe
                  ([[Lavorini 2007]]).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>

                  Brief Overview of the Traditional Roman Lining Process
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The following outlines the steps of the Roman lining process.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The painting is prepared for lining by applying an overall
                      facing, removing it from its support, cleaning the reverse
                      of the canvas, mending tears, and applying any canvas
                      inserts.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Diluted <em>colletta</em> (glue) is applied to the back of
                      the original canvas to consolidate preparatory layers
                      before the lining procedure.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          The <em>colletta</em> is often composed of hide glue,
                          water, white vinegar, molasses, and ox gall, and
                          sometimes a small amount of fungicide.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          For moisture-sensitive paintings, a synthetic adhesive
                          or mastic resin can be substituted for this step.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The lining canvas is soaked in water for at least twelve
                      hours and then left to dry before being stretched onto a
                      wood or metal working frame.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      A thin layer of <em>colla di pasta</em> or
                      <em>colla pasta</em> (glue paste) is spread onto the back
                      of the painting. The lining canvas is placed on the back
                      of the painting and massaged from the reverse, pushing
                      from the center outward to remove excess glue. This
                      process is sometimes repeated from the front of the
                      painting until only a thin layer of glue remains.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          The <em>colla pasta</em> is often composed of wheat
                          flour, water, undiluted or dry <em>colletta</em>, and
                          Venice turpentine. A fungicide and/or alum is also
                          sometimes added.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          Although excess glue is extracted, it is important
                          that the lining canvas be fully impregnated with the
                          glue paste for an adequate bond with the original
                          canvas.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      After drying for several hours in an upright position, the
                      painting is then ironed from the front through waxed paper
                      until the surface is dry to the touch. Normally the iron
                      weighs 3–7 kg and is heated to 45°C–60°C.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The painting is left to dry fully for at least a day
                      before removing the facing. After several days, the
                      painting can then be stretched onto its final support.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>

                </ol>
                <p>
                  The Roman method has several advantages, primarily a lower
                  overall weight after lining, a thin layer of glue, and the
                  flexibility of the open-weave canvases. It does have
                  limitations, however, and would not be suitable for highly
                  damaged or sensitive works. The heat, moisture, and pressure
                  of traditional glue-paste lining processes are also not
                  appropriate for many paintings, and require a very skilled
                  practitioner for proper implementation.

                <p>
                  After investigation into the various types of traditional
                  Italian lining canvases, it was determined
                  <em>Adoration of the Shepherds</em> was lined with a Roman
                  <em>tela patta</em> canvas. The exact techniques and recipes
                  used for its application remain unknown, though Italian
                  scholarship provides an overview of the salient differences
                  between the Florentine and Roman methodologies that may have
                  been employed. Traditional glue-paste linings are now
                  considered inappropriate for many works, yet almost ninety
                  years later this Roman lining remains unobtrusive and
                  flexible. During treatment it was decided to retain the lining
                  due to its excellent state of preservation. There are many
                  favorable aspects of the Roman lining process, and further
                  experimentation using open-weave canvases with alternative
                  adhesives and/or application methods could make this
                  traditional technique less intensive while still providing a
                  light, flexible support.

                  This poster describes the evolution and current technique of
                  the procedure employed in remounting lined paintings at the
                  Balboa Art Conservation Center (BACC). BACC has been
                  performing structural treatments, including the lining of
                  canvases, since its establishment in 1975. As lining practices
                  have changed and evolved over the years, so have the
                  approaches to reattachment and retensioning of paintings on
                  stretchers at BACC. Starting with the technique of wax lining
                  and the attachment of lining canvases and original tacking
                  edges to the stretcher using adhesive all around the edges,
                  the center has moved to a system of reattaching lined canvases
                  to their stretchers using Beva since the early 1980s. The
                  adhesive provides more even, constant tension all around the
                  edges, as opposed to the individual points of stress that
                  occur when using the traditional method of restretching and
                  attachment with tacks or staples only. The BACC method also
                  minimizes any stress on the original canvas by attaching and
                  tensioning the lining canvas before the original tacking
                  margins are gently folded back and secured into place.

                <p>
                  The Balboa Art Conservation Center (BACC) has been performing
                  structural treatments on canvas paintings, including linings,
                  since its establishment in 1975. When Beva 371 replaced wax
                  resin as the most frequently used lining adhesive starting in
                  the early 1980s, it was first used in much the same way that
                  wax had been: the adhesive was applied to the edges of the
                  lining fabric and used it to adhere the edges of the lining
                  and the original tacking edges to the stretcher. However,
                  material and handling differences between wax resin and Beva
                  371 presented problems from the start. Beva 371 does not allow
                  the original tacking edges to slide over the lining as it is
                  bent around the stretcher, as wax does when heated, leading to
                  stress on the tacking edges. A face-down remounting procedure
                  that evolved and has been used at BACC since approximately
                  1985 addresses these issues, creates even tension around all
                  sides of the painting (eliminating anchor points created by
                  tacks or staples), and protects the original tacking margins
                  from stress and splitting.
                </p>
                <h2 id="preparation-steps" tabindex="-1">Preparation Steps</h2>
                <p>Certain tasks precede the lining itself.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Any tears in the original tacking edges or splitting along
                      the turnover edges are mended or reinforced before lining,
                      for example with Japanese tissue.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      In preparing the lining fabric, the adhesive is applied to
                      the lining precisely within the picture area, preferably
                      approximately 1/16 inch smaller on all sides; it does not
                      extend onto where the tacking edges will lie. The adhesive
                      used for lining has no bearing on this remounting
                      technique.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The placement of the lined painting on the stretcher is
                      determined and marked before proceeding. This can be
                      accomplished with strategic pinpricks from the front
                      connected with lines drawn on the reverse of the lining.
                      The lining fabric is then precreased along these lines.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The lining fabric is cut at the corners so that it does
                      not impede keying or expanding the stretcher.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="the-process" tabindex="-1">The Process</h2>
                <p>Lining is a six-step process.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Prepare the stretcher by adhering Beva 371 film cut to the
                      depth of the stretcher. There should be adhesive around
                      the perimeter of the stretcher (<a href="#fig-44-1"><strong>fig. 44.1</strong></a>).
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The lined painting is placed face down on a flat surface.
                      The lining canvas is precreased at the fold-over edge (<a href="#fig-44-2"><strong>fig. 44.2</strong></a>) to both help guide the conservator in the placement of
                      the stretcher and to avoid the effect commonly known as TV
                      screening (named for televisions’ original old slightly
                      rounded cathode-ray tube displays). The stretcher is put
                      in place and adjusted as needed to accommodate the size of
                      the painting.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The tacking margins of the lining canvas are secured to
                      the stretcher with pushpins on the back of the stretcher
                      (<a href="#fig-44-3"><strong>fig. 44.3</strong></a>). There should be no excessive pulling or tensioning of
                      the lining fabric; the goal is to simply hold the canvas
                      in place.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Using a tacking iron, heat the tacking margins of the
                      lining to activate the Beva 371 film and secure the
                      painting to the stretcher (<a href="#fig-44-4"><strong>fig. 44.4</strong></a>). The fabric is pulled taut with hand strength, working
                      around the four sides, making sure that the lining fabric
                      has properly adhered to the stretcher.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      At this point the stretcher can be gently expanded to
                      properly tension the painting. The original tacking
                      margins of the painting will stick out (<a href="#fig-44-5"><strong>fig. 44.5</strong></a>).
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The original tacking margins can now be folded down and
                      secured with the preferred method, for example, tacks or
                      staples (<a href="#fig-44-6"><strong>fig. 44.6</strong></a>).
                    </p>

                  Advantages of the System
                </h2>
                <p>The BACC system has a number of advantages.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The plane of the painting is established by laying it face
                      down on a flat surface. The conservator is not applying
                      force (unevenly) to pull it flat. Canvas pliers or
                      excessive pulling is not required.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Attachment of the lining canvas to the entire edges of the
                      stretcher with Beva 371 film provides even tension when
                      the stretcher is opened out, as opposed to individual
                      points of stress when using tacks or staples.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Beva 371 has good shear strength and will not slip when
                      the lining canvas is tensioned.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The stress of proper tensioning of the lined painting on
                      the stretcher is carried primarily by the lining canvas,
                      while the original canvas—and especially the fragile
                      tacking edges—are not pulled.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      After they are gently folded down, the tacking margins
                      need not be adhered to the lining overall, making reversal
                      of the lining in the future, if needed, easier and less
                      stressful to the original canvas.

                  Wax-resin lining is known to alter colors in paintings. To
                  date, however, only a few research studies have investigated
                  the conditions under which the alteration may occur and the
                  extent of the change. This research focuses on color change in
                  ground layers of seventeenth-century Netherlandish paintings.
                  Central to the research methodology is visual examination and
                  color measurements of reconstructions based on material
                  evidence from paintings and documentary research relevant to
                  the period. The procedure used for the wax-resin treatment is
                  also designed based on historical evidence. The research
                  results revealed that the composition of the ground, the layer
                  thickness, and the hiding power of the ground are influential
                  in the degree of change.

                <p>
                  Wax-resin lining was invented in the Netherlands in the first
                  half of the nineteenth century. Until the 1970s, it was
                  considered an all-over cure for structural alterations in
                  canvas paintings and therefore was used extensively by
                  conservators in the Netherlands and abroad. The technique,
                  however, proved to have detrimental effects on paintings’
                  material and physical characteristics, including color
                  changes. Although today the use of wax-resin lining is almost
                  extinct, most paintings preserved in the Netherlands received
                  this treatment in the past.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This research examined the impact of wax-resin linings on the
                  color of ground layers in seventeenth-century Netherlandish
                  paintings on canvas ([[Froment 2019]]). In these works, the
                  ground is often left visible and used as a middle tone.
                  Therefore, any color change of the ground would significantly
                  alter the overall aesthetic of the painting. Furthermore,
                  color change is considered a sign of the modification of the
                  painting’s materials, which is relevant for the future
                  conservation of these works. The results of the research aim
                  to support the work of conservation professionals in
                  identifying color change due to lining, thus preventing
                  misinterpretation of the works and enabling an adaption of
                  conservation strategies.

                <h2 id="hypothesis" tabindex="-1">Hypothesis</h2>
                <p>
                  Material evidence found in four paintings by Jacob Jordaens
                  (1593–1678) in the Royal Palace Amsterdam provided the basis
                  for the research hypothesis (<a href="#fig-45-1"><strong>fig. 45.1</strong></a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Technical examination revealed that though the paintings were
                  in different states of condition, they had aged in identical
                  environments and received similar restoration treatments,
                  including wax-resin linings in 1963 ([[van Eikema Hommes and
                  Froment 2011]]). Differing degrees of darkness were
                  particularly striking (<a href="#fig-45-2"><strong>figs. 45.2</strong></a>, <a href="#fig-45-3"><strong>45.3</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Analysis of paint cross sections from each of the paintings
                  highlighted the use of different ground types that varied in
                  both the number of layers and material composition as well as
                  the type of binding medium. The correlation between material
                  evidence and documentary sources that report color change in
                  paintings after wax-resin lining supported the hypothesis that
                  the visual consequence of wax-resin linings in
                  seventeenth-century Netherlandish paintings is related to the
                  original preparation technique.

                  The Reconstructions
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The materials and techniques used for the reconstruction were
                  based on material evidence from paintings selected for their
                  relevance to the research. These included works by Jordaens in
                  the Royal Palace Amsterdam as well as paintings by Gerard van
                  Honthorst (1592–1656) and Theodor van Thulden (1606–1678)
                  created for the Oranjezaal, a painted ballroom in the Huis ten
                  Bosch, a royal palace just outside of The Hague.
                  <em>The Night Watch,</em> 1642, by Rembrandt (1606/7–1669) was
                  also considered.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Technical study of the grounds of these paintings identified
                  three types of single ground and four types of double ground,
                  with colors of either off-white, beige, red, brown, or gray.
                  Mineral composition was analyzed with a scanning electron
                  microscope with energy dispersive X-ray. Binding media were
                  investigated using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
                  (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
                  Ground recipes found in documentary sources from the period
                  and results of technical research from other paintings were
                  also incorporated ([[Stols-Witlox 2017]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thirty-two different ground types were reconstructed. Each of
                  them was applied in a single layer on linen canvas previously
                  sized with gelled animal glue. The mineral components used for
                  the grounds were chalk, lead white, raw umber, yellow iron
                  oxide, red iron oxide, tile red, charcoal black, quartz, and
                  ball clay. Each type was used both independently and in
                  mixtures of various ratios. Two types of binding media were
                  used: linseed oil and animal glue.

                  Ground’s Hiding Power
                </h3>
                <p>
                  As the color of linen canvas darkens dramatically after
                  wax-resin impregnation, the degree to which a ground layer
                  hides the underlying canvas was hypothesized to be a key
                  parameter for color change in paintings after wax-resin
                  treatment. To investigate the influence of grounds’ hiding
                  power, a pilot study was conducted, consisting of the
                  systematic application of each ground type in different
                  thicknesses onto opacity charts. These applications were
                  subjected to color measurements in order to determine the
                  degree of hiding power of each group type at a specific
                  thickness.

                  Research into wax-resin lining methods used by conservators in
                  the Netherlands supported the choice for the lining of the
                  reconstructions. The procedure simplified historical practices
                  in order to minimize variables. Essentially, it included the
                  impregnation of reconstructions with a wax-resin mixture
                  composed of 10 parts beeswax to 3 parts colophony
                  (weight/weight). The adhesive was applied warm on the reverse
                  of the reconstructions and melted into them using a hot
                  handheld iron.

                  Color measurements were recorded with a CM-2600d Konica

                  formula was used to measure color difference (∆E*) and
                  evaluate the degree of hiding power. Furthermore, cross
                  sections from the reconstructions were analyzed using light
                  microscopy, providing further insight into the effects of
                  ground layer thickness.

                  Result showed that wax-resin impregnation caused color change
                  in 19 of the 32 ground types tested.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Comparative color measurements revealed that the extent of
                  change was influenced by the type of binding medium and both
                  the type and proportion of mineral components. Ground layer
                  thickness was also influential; in general, the thinner the
                  ground, the more significant the color change. Furthermore,
                  the pilot study showed that the extent of color change was
                  related to the degree of hiding power of the ground; all
                  oil-bound grounds that changed color were measured as poorly
                  hiding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Comparative color measurements showed that nearly all
                  reconstructions that underwent color change became darker and
                  cooler (L*, a*, and b* values decreased). An exception to this
                  was the ground composed of chalk in animal glue, which changed
                  predominately to a more yellow hue.

                <p>
                  An experiment investigated the influence of pigment type and
                  binding medium on the degree of color change. For this
                  purpose, reconstructed grounds contained a single pigment type
                  bound in either oil or glue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After impregnation, each glue-bound reconstruction changed
                  color significantly, with differences ranging from 12.21 to
                  22.09 ∆E* units.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the oil-bound grounds, those composed of either ball clay
                  or chalk measured the most altered after treatment, by 3.26
                  and 5.4 ∆E* units respectively. The grounds composed of either
                  red iron oxide, yellow iron oxide, raw umber, or charcoal
                  black did not undergo change, and the ground containing lead
                  white changed only when thinly applied, by 1.5 ∆E*.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In general, color measurements showed that glue-bound grounds
                  changed more significantly than oil-bound, thus highlighting
                  the influence of binding medium. It was assumed that voids
                  inherently present in glue-bound grounds filled with wax
                  resin, resulting in modification of refractive index and
                  surface texture, thus causing color change. In contrast with
                  the behavior of glue-bound grounds, the impregnation of
                  wax-resin adhesive into the oil-bound grounds was never
                  observed during the wax-resin treatment. For these
                  reconstructions, color change was believed to be caused by the
                  degree of hiding power of the ground. This assumption was
                  supported by the pilot study, which showed that grounds
                  containing either chalk or ball clay had poor hiding power.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After impregnation, the glue-bound ground composed of chalk
                  and the oil-bound grounds composed of chalk, lead white, and
                  ball clay developed a typical “abraded look” (<a href="#fig-45-4"><strong>figs. 45.4</strong></a>
                  and <a href="#fig-45-5"><strong>45.5</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Color measurements of these grounds reported significant
                  differences in hiding power as a result of layer thickness. As
                  thickness varies considerably due to the inherent irregular
                  texture of canvas supports, the color change of these grounds
                  was more significant on the highest points of the canvas
                  weave, resulting in local darkening (<a href="#fig-45-6"><strong>fig. 45.6</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also key is the tonal value of the grounds that contrasted
                  significantly with the darkened support.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Another experiment examined the influence of the proportion of
                  chalk on color change in reconstructed oil-bound grounds
                  containing yellow iron oxide and/or raw umber as well as lead
                  white with and without raw umber. Variables of the experiment
                  included pigment ratio and layer thickness. In general, the
                  color measurements showed that the higher the concentration of
                  chalk, the more significant the change. Furthermore, the
                  thinner the layer, the more visible the color change. However,
                  the extent of the change was dependent on the type of pigment
                  the chalk was mixed with.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, the ground composed of lead white with 50% chalk
                  changed by 5.91 ∆E* units, while the ground composed of lead
                  white with 80% chalk changed more markedly, from 6.9 to 8.27
                  ∆E* units, depending on thickness. The influence of chalk was
                  further shown when comparing these results to the
                  reconstruction composed of lead white in oil, which changed
                  only by 1.5 ∆E* units when thinly applied. Color measurements
                  also showed that the inclusion of 10% raw umber to the grounds
                  composed of lead white and chalk prevented color change, as no
                  difference was measured when the proportions of chalk were 45%
                  and 70%. In these latter instances a thinner application did
                  not cause color change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The influence of chalk on color change was also measured in
                  reconstructed grounds composed of chalk combined with yellow
                  iron oxide and/or raw umber. Grounds composed of 98% chalk
                  combined with either yellow iron oxide or 1:1 yellow iron
                  oxide and raw umber changed color more noticeably when thinly
                  applied.

                  By correlating experimental results from the reconstructions
                  with results of the pilot study, it was found that an
                  increased proportion of chalk reduced the hiding power of
                  nearly all grounds. Furthermore, the study revealed that
                  grounds composed of 98% chalk combined with either yellow iron
                  oxide or 1:1 yellow iron oxide and raw umber, as well as the
                  ground composed of 80% chalk with lead white, hid the opacity
                  charts to varying degrees that were dependent on thickness.
                  Ground types composed of chalk combined with raw umber and
                  lead white remained opaque regardless of thickness. Results
                  for grounds composed of chalk with yellow iron oxide were not
                  conclusive.

                  Quartz-Containing Oil-Bound Grounds
                </h3>
                <p>
                  After 1642, canvas paintings by Rembrandt are frequently
                  primed with a quartz containing ground. Results of technical
                  analysis revealed that this ground consists mainly of clay
                  minerals, with a high proportion of quartz sand in linseed oil
                  ([[Groen 2005]]). Research suggests that the composition of
                  quartz ground varies among paintings, with the variables
                  including the type of clay minerals and the proportion of
                  trace elements such as chalk, iron oxide, and carbon black. An
                  experiment in this study examined the influence of the
                  clay-to-quartz ratio, as well as the effect of adding of
                  yellow iron oxide on the extent of color change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each quartz-containing oil-bound ground showed substantial
                  color change following impregnation (<a href="#fig-45-7"><strong>fig. 45.7</strong></a>). The change was among the most significant of all oil-bound
                  grounds tested, with differences ranging from 4.23 to 6.80 ∆E*
                  units. Trends indicated that the higher the ratio of quartz to
                  clay, the greater the change. Although the inclusion of 3%
                  yellow iron oxide tended to reduce this effect, color change
                  remained significant. Finally, each of the quartz-containing
                  grounds tested changed color to a similar extent regardless of
                  thickness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This series of grounds proved to have the poorest hiding power
                  of all grounds tested (<a href="#fig-45-8"><strong>fig. 45.8</strong></a>). This condition was most pronounced in samples where the
                  ground was applied thickly, while most other grounds examined
                  in this study were opaque under those conditions. Furthermore,
                  the pilot study indicated that the higher the concentration of
                  quartz, the poorer the hiding power, supporting the influence
                  of hiding power on the color change of the reconstructions.

                <p>
                  The study of visual phenomena observed on historically
                  informed reconstructions was central to this research. The
                  reconstructions are a simplification of the material and
                  physical complexities usually found in historical paintings.
                  This approach proved to be beneficial, since it allowed
                  clarity of conditions and understanding of the extent to which
                  wax-resin linings may have changed the color of paintings. It
                  also permitted the identification of physical phenomena
                  resulting from lining treatment.

                  Close examinations enabled Lab O to analyze the weave

                  A weave draft of the El Greco canvas had already been

                <p>
                  When a painting on canvas is removed from its stretcher, it
                  usually undergoes a tension variation. In most cases it will
                  be restretched, using added tacking edges, on a temporary
                  stretcher for structural treatment (for example, consolidation
                  of the paint and ground layers or for lining). During this
                  operation, the painting is put under tension and stretched.
                  When the work is finished, the canvas is detached again
                  (another contraction) to be definitively stretched on the
                  final stretcher (another stretching). These repeated movements
                  cause mechanical stresses in the painting that affect its
                  different layers: the canvas as well as ground and paint
                  layers and these can result in real structural microtraumas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The problem has previously been highlighted, for instance by
                  V. R. Mehra and Sergio Taiti.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Both restorers, despite coming from different restoration
                  traditions and schools of thought, dedicated particular
                  attention to the study of a method for maintaining constant
                  tension during the treatment of a painting, specifically so as
                  to avoid problems created by relaxation and contraction of the
                  canvas. Mehra set up a well-known system with three stretchers
                  in which, after the painting is removed from its stretcher, it
                  is immediately tensioned on an interim stretcher by means of a
                  nonwoven fabric. After the consolidation phase (or after
                  lining, in the final phase), the system obtained is dismantled
                  and then the painting is remounted on the definitive
                  stretcher. A possible solution, shared during his lessons,
                  consisted of remounting the painting from the interim
                  stretcher to a larger, definitive stretcher. The latter is
                  positioned on the back, and the canvas is secured directly
                  from the front, along the original edges, with metal staples.
                  Naturally, Mehra was aware that this practice was not always
                  feasible, especially in the presence of an original stretcher
                  or dimensional restrictions (for example, due to a frame or
                  reinstallation in an architectural niche).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In parallel, Taiti, well aware of the stresses and movements
                  occurring in a painting undergoing consolidation with animal
                  glue in an aqueous solution (following the traditional
                  techniques of Florentine glue-paste lining), figured out how
                  to mount the painting on a larger interim stretcher. He
                  employed strips of kraft paper, later replaced by polyester
                  canvas as the use of different materials evolved, and thus
                  maintained tension until the eventual lining. He was also
                  developing ideas on the final step, although, unfortunately,
                  these were never brought to fruition due to his premature
                  death.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sensitivity of approach demonstrated by these two
                  important figures for numerous aspects of restoration was
                  greatly influential as it spurred the desire to continue
                  delving into what is a delicate and often undervalued theme.

                  undergoing restoration, with significant results. This
                  innovation aims to maintain the painting under a constant
                  tension during all of the phases of treatment and to transfer
                  the degree of tension that is initially established for the
                  temporary stretcher to the definitive one, thereby avoiding
                  the potentially damaging “accordion” effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The system is extremely versatile in that it is applicable to
                  paintings undergoing either only consolidation or a full
                  lining, and hinges on the use of specially designed perimeter
                  strips. Each strip is composed of two polyester canvas layers:
                  the first, a lightweight polyester that comes in contact with
                  the original painting (Origam 254, 18 g/m^2^), and the second,
                  a heavier polyester (Trevira C.S. Ispra, 130 g/m^2^). Each is
                  frayed<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  for about 10 mm along the longer edge. The individual strips,
                  thus prepared, are then paired in a staggered manner,
                  longitudinally, with Beva film between them. They are then
                  inserted in a vacuum envelope, and the adhesive is reactivated
                  by heating it to 80°C, a measure aimed at ensuring a
                  particularly solid bond<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  (<a href="#fig-47-1"><strong>fig. 47.1</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once the painting is detached from the original stretcher, and
                  after the back has been cleaned, it is possible to apply these
                  double strips to the back of the original canvas (inside the
                  fold-over marks from the original stretcher at a distance
                  suited to the specific painting) with pressure (best if
                  generated with vacuum suction, for a better and more even
                  bond) and heat, but only up to the minimal temperature for
                  Beva reactivation (65°C), to provide for better reversibility.
                  This means the double strip adheres to the original canvas
                  less aggressively, while the bond between the two strips is
                  stronger.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Afterward, the original canvas is stretched on the temporary
                  stretcher using the plane of the table to provide support for
                  the canvas as the double-layer perimeter strips are secured to
                  the temporary stretcher (<a href="#fig-47-2"><strong>fig. 47.2</strong></a>). After structural conservation treatment, the temporary
                  stretcher and canvas are again laid face down on a flat
                  surface. The definitive stretcher is then positioned on the
                  back, within the width of the temporary stretcher, aligned
                  with the fold-over marks on the original canvas. The first of
                  the two layers of the added tacking margin (the heavier,
                  outside one) is cut free from the temporary stretcher and
                  fixed to the definitive one with steel staples, thus not
                  allowing the canvas to contract (<strong><a href="#fig-47-3">figs. 47.3</a>,
                    <a href="#fig-47-4">47.4</a></strong>). Only after having secured the entire perimeter is the
                  second layer of the strip cut free from the working stretcher
                  and fixed to the definitive one (<a href="#fig-47-5"><strong>fig. 47.5</strong></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This sequence avoids variations in tension as, during the
                  shift to the final stretcher, a bond is always maintained with
                  the temporary stretcher. The initial tension is constant and
                  can be transferred to the definitive stretcher.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For further study, the system could be tested on different
                  models while carrying out measurements in order to give some
                  scientific weight to the method described. This would provide
                  numerical values and objective data to support the use of this
                  simple technical innovation.

                  The paper presents the results of the case study in which a

                  glue to consolidate the paint layer. Lining the original

                <p>
                  The application of wax and wax-resin materials was a common
                  practice in conservation and restoration in Russia from the
                  nineteenth century until the last quarter of the twentieth.
                  Due to their high stability and availability, these materials
                  were used for a wide range of operations: lining,
                  strip-lining, tear mending, and consolidation of ground and
                  paint layer. Wax-resin lining began to be used in Russia from
                  the mid-twentieth century ([[Gorin and Cherkasova 1977|,
                  113]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main reasons for using wax and wax-resin compositions for
                  consolidation were interlayer cleavage, flaking of the paint
                  layer from oil ground, previous restoration with wax-resin,
                  the deterioration of paintings caused by mildew or heat, and
                  the like ([[Gorin and Cherkasova 1977|, 110]]). Nonetheless,
                  the authors of Russian manuals on restoration mentioned the
                  negative consequences of using wax-resin adhesives that had
                  been observed. For example,
                  <em>The Restoration of Easel Oil Paintings</em> states,
                  “Wax-resin composition has a number of negative properties for
                  lining. Impregnating porous chalk grounds, it changes the
                  general tone of the painting towards darkening, especially in
                  the light areas of the picture. During lining the wax-resin
                  composition impregnates the author’s canvas and practically
                  cannot be removed from the picture. It destroys the
                  hygroscopic properties of the canvas, which are necessary for
                  correcting canvas deformations, the picture loses its
                  elasticity, becomes firm and heavy.” ([[Gorin and Cherkasova
                  1977|, 129]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the negative effects of wax and wax-resin impregnation
                  of canvas paintings were scientifically proven and presented
                  by Gustav Berger and Harold Zeliger in 1975, the application
                  of these materials by Russian conservators came to be limited,
                  primarily performed only for the consolidation of murals made
                  in oil technique ([[Fedoseeva 1999|, 24–36]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the great problems mentioned by Berger and Zeliger is
                  the difficulty of removal of wax and wax resin from the
                  structure of canvas ([[Berger and Zeliger 1975]]). Wax
                  treatment limits the use of other restoration materials,
                  particularly water-based ones, for conservation. In this
                  regard, diverse methods of wax/wax-resin extraction have been
                  developed and suggested. The most widely adopted method is the
                  use of a heated spatula and filter paper for absorption of
                  melting wax. The main disadvantage of such a procedure is
                  that, during heating, wax is only partly absorbed by the
                  paper, and it also penetrates deeper in the structure of
                  canvas fibers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another popular method of wax removal is mineral-spirit
                  compresses. After being subjected to the solvent, wax softens
                  and can be easily taken away—but only from the surface of the
                  canvas. In 1988, Landgrebe suggested using solvent pastes
                  based on hydroxypropyl cellulose (Klucel M) and solvent
                  mixtures ([[Nicolaus 1999|, 95]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  To achieve more complete removal of wax-resin adhesives, any
                  such treatment should be done on a low-pressure table.
                  However, not every conservation studio is equipped with one.
                  Thus, searching for a material that can effectively absorb wax
                  and wax-resin residues from the structure of canvas paintings
                  without special equipment is a focus area.

                  A New Process for Wax Removal
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In 2004, in the State Research Institute for Restoration
                  (GOSNIIR), in Moscow, Russia, Vilena Kireeva and Maria
                  Churakova developed a procedure of removing oil-resin stains
                  from the canvas structure with pyrogenic silicon dioxide
                  (trade name AEROSIL) ([[Kireeva and Churakova 2013]]). This
                  procedure was first applied during the restoration of the
                  painting <em>Adoration of the Magi</em> by the
                  eighteenth-century German artist Johann Knechtel ([[Churakova
                  2005]]). Earlier, the same substance had been successfully
                  used to clean old, dried oil from a parchment in the
                  Department of Conservation of Medieval Manuscripts at

                  This poster presents the results of the case study of applying
                  an AEROSIL and mineral spirit mixture to remove beeswax from a
                  canvas.

                  AEROSIL is a trade name of a line of fumed silica (SiO~2~)
                  products produced by the German chemical company Evonik
                  Industries. It is a pure, very fine powder with a specific
                  surface area of 50 m^2^/g or more. AEROSIL is synthesized
                  during flame hydrolysis (T&nbsp;&gt;1000°C) of silicon
                  tetrachloride (SiCl~4~) by the following reaction:
                </p>
                <p>SiCl~4~ + 2H~2~ + O~2~ = SiO~2~ + 4HCl</p>
                <p>
                  The adsorption properties of AEROSIL are determined by silanol
                  (SiOH) and siloxane (SiOSi) functional groups presented on its
                  surface ([[Evonik n.d.]]; [[Zhuravlev 2000]]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  For beeswax removal, purified mineral spirit (Maimeri) was
                  used as a solvent. AEROSIL and mineral spirit were mixed in
                  ratio of 1 mg to 10 ml (respectively), until the mixture form
                  a transparent, gel-like substance.

                <p>
                  Kireeva and Churakova offered two ways of working with the
                  paste. In the first, the paste is spread on the stain that
                  needs to be removed and is covered with cellophane film to
                  prevent solvent evaporation (in their work, ethanol was used).
                  For better absorption, the paste is applied in a thick layer
                  using a metal spatula or palette knife and left for ten to
                  fifteen minutes. In the case study described by the authors,
                  the paste was colored by the removed resin ([[Kireeva and
                  Churakova 2013]]). After the specified time, the cellophane
                  film is removed to allow the solvent to evaporate. The solvent
                  is considered to have evaporated from the paste when the
                  latter loses its transparency. The dried paste, with the
                  absorbed material, is then cleaned from the surface of the
                  canvas with scalpel, bristle brush, and vacuum cleaner. These
                  operations should be repeated until the maximum possible stain
                  removal has occurred.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second method employs heat to accelerate the absorption
                  process. This option works more effectively in the case of
                  thicker and uneven stains. The paste is applied on the treated
                  area, covered with fluoroplastic film, and ironed with a
                  heated spatula at a temperature of 40°C–50°C for around three
                  to five minutes. After the heating procedure, the
                  fluoroplastic film is removed, and the paste is left on the
                  treated area surface until the solvent evaporates. As in the
                  first method, the solvent is considered evaporated when the
                  paste loses its transparency and becomes whitish or colored
                  with the resin. Cleaning the residues of the paste from the
                  surface of the canvas is done as described in the first
                  method. If necessary, the procedure can be repeated.

                  Case Study: <em>Portrait of F. N. Sinyavina</em> by F. S.
                  Rokotov
                </h2>
                <p>
                  In Russia, a large number of paintings that have previously
                  been treated with beeswax currently require conservation. One
                  of these works was the
                  <em>Portrait of F. N. Sinyavina</em> painted by the great
                  Russian artist Fyodor Rokotov (1735/1736–1808) in the State
                  Historical Museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The canvas of the painting had a big tear that had been fixed
                  with beeswax (<strong>figs. <a href="#fig-48-1">48.1</a>,
                    <a href="#fig-48-2">48.2</a>)</strong>, and losses of ground and paint layer had been filled with
                  beeswax and then overpainted in oil (see
                  <a href="#fig-48-1"><strong>fig. 48.1</strong></a>). Over time, the wax had lost its adhesive strength, which
                  resulted in the detachment of the tear edges and the formation
                  of the strains in the canvas near the tear. The original paint
                  layer was covered with surface dirt, overpaint, wax drops, and
                  uneven and darkened varnish. The painting was stretched on a
                  stretcher of a smaller size than it originally had, with the
                  paint layer wrapped over the sides.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As already mentioned, wax treatment limits the use of
                  restoration materials other than synthetic or natural wax. To
                  avoid repeated restoration of the painting using wax-based
                  compositions, the beeswax needed to be removed from the canvas
                  structure, and the AEROSIL-based paste was applied for this
                  purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Removal of beeswax from the canvas was done using the first
                  method described in the Procedure Outline section above. (It
                  is worthwhile to note that during wax absorption the change in
                  the paste color was not observed.) After the mineral spirit
                  evaporated, the surface layer of the paste with absorbed
                  beeswax was removed with a scalpel (<a href="#fig-48-3"><strong>fig. 48.3</strong></a>), followed by the use of a bristle brush and vacuum cleaner
                  for more complete cleaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This procedure allowed 5% sturgeon glue to be used to
                  consolidate the paint layer and ground. The tear was then
                  mended thread-by-thread with a 5% solution of polyvinyl
                  butyral (PVB) in isopropanol (with a high degree of purity)
                  (<a href="#fig-48-4"><strong>fig. 48.4a, b</strong></a>). On the reverse, the tear area was reinforced with
                  additional threads taken from canvas edges to make the tear
                  area more secure during stretching on a new stretcher.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the elimination of canvas deformations, losses to the
                  ground were filled. Surface cleaning was done using a solution
                  of one part of purified ox bile and four parts distilled
                  water. After applying the mixture, the treated area was rinsed
                  with distilled water. A mixture of ethanol and pinene (1:2),
                  was used to thin the darkened varnish.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After strip lining, the painting was stretched on a new
                  stretcher of appropriate size for the picture; this also helps
                  to control canvas tension. Retouching the paint losses was
                  performed, and the surface of the painting was covered with
                  protective varnish based on dammar resin. Labels with
                  inscriptions from the old stretcher were transferred onto
                  acid-free cardboard and fixed to the central bar of the new
                  stretcher.
                </p>
                <h2 id="conclusions" tabindex="-1">Conclusions</h2>
                <p>
                  We presented the results of the case study of applying a
                  solvent paste based on fumed silica (AEROSIL) to remove
                  beeswax from the canvas structure of a portrait painted by
                  Russian artist Fyodor Rokotov. The painting had a large tear
                  that had been previously fixed with beeswax, and ground losses
                  had also been filled with beeswax and had oil overpaints. The
                  removal of beeswax residues using AEROSIL paste enabled
                  thread-by-thread tear mending using polyvinyl butyral adhesive
                  and as well as the use of water-based glue to consolidate the
                  paint layer. As a result of these treatments, lining the
                  original canvas was able to be avoided.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The suggested solvent paste based on AEROSIL proved to be a
                  nice material for absorbing both beeswax and oil-resin stains
                  from the structure of the canvas. It enables removal of these
                  materials from local treated areas of paintings without any
                  special equipment. Moreover, it allows using water-based glues
                  to be used for further treatments in the future.
