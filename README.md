| branch | about |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | The primary branch. Currently the same as `prototype`. |
| `forthcoming` | A static placeholder page that is displayed at the bookâ€™s final URL on getty.edu prior to publication |
| `first-pages`, `second-pages`, `final-pages`| 11ty versions of the project at various stages. All working branches should be made off of these. |

## Using the 11ty Version

1. Clone this repository and select the appropriate branch.

2. In Terminal, make sure you are using Node 17.5.0 or higher, with `node --version`. (See section on NVM below.)

3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies. This just needs to be done once when first cloning the project, or whenever the core template/code files are updated.

4. See the preview with `npm run dev`. I find it needs to be stopped and restarted often to get it to refresh changes, especially with YAML.

## Using NVM to Manage Different Node Verisons

The full instructions are here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm. But this condensed version should cover the basics.

1. Install the script with the following command:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

2. Verify with this command, which should return `nvm`. If it does not, see the Troubleshooting info at https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#troubleshooting-on-macos.

```
command -v nvm
```

3. Install the versions of node you want to use:

```
nvm install 14.18.1
```

```
nvm install 17.5.0
```

4. Optionally, set a default version to use with `nvm alias default 14.18.1` or `nvm alias default 17.5.0`. This default will be the one used every time you open a new Terminal window.

5. To choose/change a Node version to run use `nvm use 14` or `nvm use 17`. This will be the version used for as long as that Terminal window is open, or until you change it again.

## Creating a PDF Version

1. Run `quire build`

2. If the PDF will be sent to digital printer, run the following command to ensure color profiles are correct:

    ```
    magick mogrify -profile bin/adobe-rgb-1998.icm _site/iiif/**/print-image.jpg
    ```

3. In `_site/pdf.css` find `/_assets/fonts/` and replace with `_assets/fonts/`

4. In `_site/pdf.html` find `_assets/tables/` and replace with `_assets/`

5. With PrinceXML 14.2 installed, run `quire pdf --lib prince`

## Creating an EPUB Version

As of the first publication date (July 2023) Quire's EPUB functionality was outputting invalid EPUB files. For this publication, that output was taken and manually fixed. Any changes that need to be made to the EPUB will have to be done manually to those fixed source files. The files (`_epub-src`) can be found on the department server with the final e-book files. 

1. Copy the `_epub-src` directory to the project repo and change the name to `_epub`.

2. Make any necessary changes within the `_epub` files.

3. Run `quire epub` to create the EPUB file.

4. Validate:

    ```
    java -jar path/to/local/epubcheck-5.0.0/epubcheck.jar path/to/local/quire-project/epubjs.epub
    ```

5. Resave the updated `_epub` directory as `_epub-src` to the department server.
