Turner loose-lining canvas (painting dated 1846). The peaks (modes) for the Turner canvas are at much less molar mass and there is a greater spread of molar masses than for the new canvas, indicating that the long cellulose molecules have been cleaved at many points. Also, the darker exposed parts are more degraded than the lighter parts behind the stretcher. Canvas samples analyzed at BOKU Vienna during the EU MEMORI project (Jeong et al. 2013)."

These master curves help us understand which layer is carrying the tension over long periods of time and during short events like a shock (from 1 millisecond to 100 years), and in cold and hot environments."
