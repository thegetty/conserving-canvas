  - term: "abrasion"
    definition: "Damaged area of paint, resulting from the scraping, rubbing down, or grinding away of the upper paint layers. A combination of an iron that is too hot plus careless application of pressure during hand lining will easily produce this form of damage, and frequently the excess heat, unevenly maintained in local areas, will succeed in softening, scorching, and burning the paint surface so that it adheres to any protective layers of paper and is subsequently removed with these facing layers after the lining is completed. On a smaller scale, an overheated spatula used for fixing down flaking paint will have a similar effect. Often seen as a regular pattern mirroring the canvas."

It contains varying proportions of hydrocarbons, esters, free acids and other compounds, depending on where it was produced. Color and texture vary with origin. Bleaching is usually affected by (a) simple purifying and de-colorizing with charcoal or Fuller’s earth (or similar bleaching earth) or boiling with water; (b) via oxidation by exposure to air or by treatment with oxidizing agents, such as ozone, chlorine, permanganate, potassium dichromate. Use of strong oxidizing agents (e.g., dichromates or chlorine) produces a more brittle and crystalline product. Beeswaxes are widely used in hot­melt wax-resin lining and facing adhesives because of their stability, inertness, and relative impermeability to moisture."

  - term: "bond strength"
    definition: "The force required to break an adhesive assembly. Three types of failure may occur, either separately or in combination: (1) Failure at the interface between the adhesive and adherend, called adhesive failure. The ability to resist adhesive failure is termed the *adhesive strength*. (2) Failure within the adhesive layer. This is called cohesive failure (of the adhesive), and occurs, for example, when wax-resin-impregnated canvases are separated. The ability of an adhesive to resist such failure is the cohesive strength (of the adhesive). (3) Failure of one or other of the adherents. This occurs when the strength of one of the adherends is less than either the adhesive strength or cohesive strength of the adhesive. Bond strength varies according to how the load is applied and is expressed accordingly: tensile strength, peel strength, cleavage strength, impact strength, sheer strength, and so forth."

  - term: "convection patterns"
    definition: "Dust deposits visible on a wall on which a painting has been hanging. The restricted conditions for circulation, which seldom allow an unrestrained passage to warm, moisture-bearing air currents, cause dust patterns to accumulate. These can show detailed images of the stretcher, frame, canvas, keys, labels, and other components of the picture, even though it is not in contact with the wall. These patterns may take twenty years or so to form but can clearly indicate wide variations within the microclimate, direction of air flow, and the like behind the picture."

    aat:

  - term: "cotton"
    definition: "The seed hair of the cotton plant. Long, fine fibers make fine yarns, while short, coarse fibers make coarser yarns, the four main types ranging from coarse to fine are Indian, American, Egyptian, and Sea Island, but there is considerable variation within each type. The breaking strength of cotton increases with increased RH, and is good when wet, but the fibers are nearly pure cellulose and thus are readily affected by acids and oxidizing agents, have low resistance to mold attack, and react rapidly to RH change. Once degraded their wet strength will be lower than the dry strength. However, in hot, dry climates they exhibit good resistance to breakdown. Cotton came into wider use as a paint support in the middle of the twentieth century when it provided large quantities of cheap ready-made artists’ canvas, but it developed a reputation for impermanence. Consequently, its use as a lining fabric is not common."

    aat: [300214730]

  - term: "cupping"
    definition: "Islands of aged paint, bounded by cracks, with upward curving edges forming saucer shapes; these often draw a less stiff canvas support with them. They are induced by slight shrinkage of the canvas support or by chemical contraction of the upper stratum of the paint and/or differential contraction of the paint and varnish films, which prevents the cracked paint from lying completely flat. Frequently, excess pressure and heat are used in an attempt to reduce cupping during the lining process, which can result in the tops of the cracks being crushed and the paint surface abraded."

  - term: "double lining"
    definition: "In large pictures, a single lining may not be strong enough to support the weight of the original canvas and paint. In such cases a second lining may be carried out on the back of the first, and both lining canvases are fastened to the stretcher. Double lining may also be used to support seams or tears of any length. Sometimes, different adhesives are used for the two linings—first an aqueous (glue-paste) adhesive and then a wax-resin adhesive."

  - term: "epoxy resins"
    definition: "Epoxy adhesives comprise a liquid or a fusible solid containing epoxide groups and a curing agent containing functional groups with which the epoxide groups combine to form a cross-linked polymer. The curing is an irreversible reaction that results in a thermoset resin with only slight shrinkage. A wide range of properties can be obtained by the use of different resin-hardener adhesive systems. Epoxy resins such as Araldite are used in preparing honeycombed auxiliary supports. Because of their irreversible nature they are not used directly as lining adhesives, but occasionally they can be employed for joining tears prior to lining. Trade name: Araldite (Huntsman Corporation)."

    definition: "A process whereby an adaptable material (very often a thin tissue such as Eltoline tissue, mulberry paper, sulfite paper, fine silk, very thin cartridge paper) is glued to the face of picture to protect the paint layer during lining or other mechanical manipulation of the support. A chosen facing adhesive is applied either directly through the facing fabric onto the paint surface or separately to the tissue, which is then carefully applied to the paint to avoid wrinkling. In major support treatment, such as transfer, composite facings may be necessary, using different types of material and adhesive in successive layers."

    aat:

  - term: "facing patterns"
    definition: "Markings left on the surface of a painting by the facing material during or after the lining. May be caused by excessive heat softening the final paint layers, or by the facing mix having an affinity for a soft paint surface (e.g., a natural wax-resin facing adhesive for a final resinous glaze), or by excessive pressure imprinting the edges, joins, or wrinkles in the facing material into the paint texture."
    aat:

  - term: "feathering"
    definition: "In strip-lining and patching canvas pictures, the piece of canvas used for the repair should not have a hard edge, which could show through as a ridge on the front of the picture. Thus, some threads along each side are removed, leaving only perpendicular strands at the edges. This creates a soft frayed or feathered transition, similar to a slight chamfer. The edge is sometimes not straight to further diminish the risk of it showing through."

  - term: "flax"
    definition: "Plant from whose fibers linen is made. These fibers are fairly long, having a compound structure, and the twists in the yarn is usually fewer per unit length than that of cotton yarns because of the greater length. With time, continuous adjustment to changes of moisture content in the air can cause these compound fibers of the woven linen to fall apart and become so weak that the twist of the yarns and the crossing of the yarns in the fabric can no longer hold them in place. Some aged flax fibers have been known to develop a twist like a cotton fiber. Canada is currently the world’s largest flax producer, and the very fine linens are made in Belgium, Ireland, and Scotland."

  - term: "flour paste"
    definition: "An adhesive differing from starch paste in working properties, in that flour contains gluten, a proteinaceous material, as well as starch. Different flour pastes also differ in working properties. Wheat, rye, rice, and linseed flours are those commonly chosen. Flour pastes are widely used in the Italian *pasta* lining adhesives, which are mixtures of animal glue, flour paste, Venice turpentine, and various other materials. The purpose of the flour paste is to act as a filler in the mixture, having lower contracting forces than animal glue and giving a higher solid-to-liquid ratio; it also provides “slip” and aids spreading. Can be susceptible to mold and insect attack."

  - term: "gesso"
    definition: "The word is Italian for gypsum. Gesso is a pale, creamy white priming composed of burnt gypsum (plaster of Paris) mixed with glue. Two kinds of gesso grounds were used by early Italian painters: (1) *gesso grosso,* a mixture of plaster and glue size, which was applied direct to the painting support (usually panel), and (2) *gesso sottile,* a finer crystalline gypsum (slaked plaster of Paris) mixed with glue size, which could be used as a final surface over *gesso grosso* but also as a priming for canvas. *Gesso* has come to have a wider meaning today, which now includes grounds made from chalk (whiting) or another inert white pigment, bound with acrylic emulsions, glue size, parchment size, calfskin glue, rabbit-skin glue, or isinglass. Modified gesso is also common, in which the addition of white lead bound with flour paste and drying oil is used to produce “gesso” grounds more suited to oil techniques."
    aat: [300014952]

  - term: "glass fiber woven fabric"
    definition: "Blown or drawn glass that has been made into fibers when molten and subsequently woven. The fibers are usually lubricated to assist weaving (if a nondrying oil is used as the lubricant, it can reduce the bond strength of some lining adhesives). The resulting fabric may be obtained in a variety of weaves, weights, and textures, with the yarn locked or unlocked. As an inorganic fabric, it is inert and offers resistance to agents of organic decay, molds, and so forth. It provides a degree of permanence plus an even, smooth surface texture that cannot be matched by natural-fiber woven fabrics. Probably first used as a lining support in London in 1952, it initially found fairly wide use in conservation, especially to produce transparent linings in combination with hot-melt adhesives, but is rarely used today because the fabric is difficult and hazardous to handle."
    aat:

  - term: "glass transition temperature"
    definition: "The glass-to-liquid transition, or glass transition, is the gradual and reversible transition in amorphous materials (or in amorphous regions within semicrystalline materials) from a hard and relatively brittle “glassy” state into a viscous or rubbery state as the temperature is increased. The glass-transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) of a material characterizes the range of temperatures over which this glass transition occurs. It is always lower than the melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) of the crystalline state of the material, if it has one."

  - term: "glaze"
    definition: "A layer of transparent or semitransparent paint through which the light passing to the surface beneath is reflected back such that the color of the glaze modifies that of the lighter underlying color. Essentially, a glaze uses transparent pigment—one with a low refractive index, such as lake, ultramarine, copper resinate, Prussian blue. Because of the higher vehicle-pigment ratio and the often resinous content, glazes can be affected by any excessive heat and pressure during lining; sometimes they will retain the imprint of facing paper fibers or joins in the facing material."
    aat: [300015091]

  - term: "glue paste"

    aat: [300014203]

  - term: "heat-seal adhesives"
    definition: "Heat-activated adhesives generally consisting of two or more resins. One of these has a high softening point and high molecular weight and gives cohesive strength to the adhesive. Another may have a lower softening (or melting) point and lower molecular weight. At a given elevated temperature, the low-molecular-weight resin fuses and dissolves the high-molecular-weight resin, yielding a viscous solution. With application of pressure and after cooling the solution solidifies to form the adhesive bond. Bond strength may vary according to the temperature to which the assembly is raised. Individual resins with a sufficiently low softening point can be used alone as heat-seal adhesives. Other components such as waxes may be added to increase tack or flow during bond formation and to adjust the heat-seal temperature. The adhesives are generally applied in solution. They differ in this respect and in their viscosity from hot melt adhesives such as wax-resin. Examples of heat-seal adhesives used in lining are Beva 371 and PVA formulations."

    aat: [300254487]

  - term: "heat sources"
    definition: "Depending on type of adhesive and method of lining required to effect impregnation and/or adhesion, the heat source may take the form of: (1) actual contact with the painting, or lining surfaces, passing by thermal conduction from irons, spatulas, heated rubber blankets, hot tables, and similar devices into the lining materials, or (2) radiant heat, derived from infrared lamps or heaters, hot air blowers, photographic light bulbs, or electric heating elements held at a distance from the lining area. Heat may be applied locally or over the whole area; usually the former will involve heat for a shorter time while the latter produces overall greater heat and often a much lengthier process. The heat may be applied from one or both sides alternately or simultaneously, depending on technique. With overall heating methods, such as hot tables, insulating layers (such as Melinex) may be employed to cut down heat loss to the surrounding air, thus enabling optimum temperatures for the lining process to be reached more quickly and in a controllable manner."

  - term: "hot-melt adhesives"
    definition: "An adhesive that is solid at room temperature, on heating melts to a mobile liquid, and resolidifies on cooling to form the adhesive bond. The advantages of hot melts (such as the well-known wax-resin lining adhesives) are their low viscosity, and hence ready flow, and good penetration during bond formation.

  - term: "linen"
    definition: "Textile made from the bast fiber of the flax plant. As with cotton canvases, when wet the undegraded linen fabric can have an increased breaking strength of up to 30%. The reverse is true for degraded canvases that have undergone the damaging effects of chemicals, heat, and light; then their wet strength will be less than their dry strength. Linen has been the most common painting support for centuries, and is still the most commonly chosen lining fabric, although synthetic fabrics or mixtures of linen and synthetic fibers are increasingly used."

  - term: "lining"
    definition: "The adhering of a fabric (traditionally a fine linen canvas) or solid support to the reverse side of a painting where the support has degraded to provide insufficient structural support. The purpose may be to counteract structural weakness in the original canvas itself and/or to secure cleavage between the paint, ground, and canvas layers. Past practice also used the adhesive chosen in the lining procedure to impregnate the canvas and the ground and paint layers from the reverse. Currently, consolidation and stabilization of the ground and paint layers would be a separate process, with the lining providing support. Several techniques are used employing a range of adhesives and supports."

  - term: "loose-lining"
    definition: "A layer of fabric, which might be also sized and painted, that is in contact with but not adhered to the reverse of a canvas or lining. It provides extra support and also buffers against environmental fluctuations of relative humidity and temperature. Original loose linings have been found on eighteenth-century paintings and the practice was common in nineteenth-century England, when commercial artists’ colormen would supply stretched canvases with two layers of primed canvas; the layer on the reverse would have the primed face exposed. Paintings prepared in this manner have proved to be exceptionally well preserved. Adding a “tooth” to the loose lining by raising the fibers can improve the support it provides."

The polycyclohexanones have similar visual and handling properties to the natural resins dammar and mastic but superior stability. They have thus found use as alternative resins in varnishes. They are all soluble in mineral spirits, are very brittle, and soften at 80°C–90°C. Trade names: AW2, M52. MS2A, MS2B, MS3, Ketone-N (MS2A is no longer commercially available and has been replaced with MS3.

    definition: "Woven textiles from fibers made from another group of synthetic polymers variously manufactured. Generally, their properties include extremely low water absorption (even when immersed), no swelling and thus quick drying, and stable to heating up to 130°C. The fibers extend less than those of polyamide fibers (nylon), and when processed on the cotton spinning system, the extensibility is about the same as cotton and linen. The light resistance is better than for polyamide fibers. Polyester fabrics are used fairly widely in textile conservation and are increasingly used as a component of lining fabrics. A common type is polyester sailcloth. Trade names: Cerex, Dacron, Hollytex, Kodel, Tergal, Terital, Terylene."

  - term: "pressure sources for lining"
    definition: "(1) Various sources of positive pressure have been used in lining procedures, ranging from early heated tailors’ irons (mobile sources of local pressure), the modern vacuum hot table, and other pressure systems, such as vacuum envelopes and air vortices in low-pressure systems. Other systems include weighting with flexible water containers or sandbags over the entire surface of the lining composite. Flexible synthetic sheets can be used as adaptable pressure sources over paintings. Rollers (covered with foam, nylon, rubber, felt) can also provide auxiliary mobile pressure sources. The heated spatula, though light, can bring high-pressure loads to bear on local areas. Cooling irons of between 6 and 30 pounds are commonly used in both glue- and wax-resin lining methods to maintain contact between the canvases as the lining adhesive is cooling and setting. (2) Positive pressure exerted during lining will be complemented by an equal amount of inverse pressure, the source of which usually takes the form of a flat, hard surface, such as a terrazzo floor, marble slab, composite board table, or hot table. Soft materials are often used as buffers between the painting and the pressure sources. Sandboxes, sawdust beds, and, more recently, silicone rubber molds have all been used to accommodate the relief of the painting within an overall firm support. A tensioned lining canvas during the lining process can also act as an inverse pressure source, the degree of flexibility being determined by the tautness. Other efforts to overcome the flatness characteristic of many of these inverse sources has led to the development of balanced pressure forms."

  - term: "prestretching"
    definition: "(1) Where the canvas to be lined has shrunk (indicated by cupping or buckling of the paint layer), or has been distorted by a previous lining adhesive, stretching and flattening of the original canvas to accommodate the full size of the paint layers is often carried out as a separate procedure before the lining process. Methods are various, usually involving the presence of moisture and/or heat, and can be achieved by edge attachment and local retensioning over a considerable period. It is important to remove inhibiting material (old lining canvases, adhesive, etc.). (2) Preparing a linen lining canvas by moistening after it has been stretched on a loom. The increased tension as it dries removes local variations in the weave. Adjustments to the stretching are usually needed after this process."

  - term: "putty"
    definition: "A material prepared for filling losses in a paint-ground film prior to inpainting. Puttying can be carried out before or after lining and can be applied from the front or the back of the painting. Putties generally consist of an inert filler (whiting, kaolin, titanium dioxide, and/or other pigments) dispersed in an adhesive to give a liquid or paste that is brushed, dropped, or pressed into losses; after setting it is modeled to match the texture of surrounding areas. Inserting putty into losses before lining reduces the risk of the original canvas being pushed to the surface in these areas during the lining process. The adhesive may be a synthetic resin solution or emulsion, wax or wax resin, or a natural glue such as gelatin, and it may contain a variety of additives (e.g., stand oil). The properties important in a filler are ease of handling and modeling, minimal shrinkage on setting, ease of removal from surrounding paint, flexibility, and retention of color with age."

    aat: [300390594]

  - term: "refractive index (RI)"
    definition: "The RI of a medium is the ratio of the velocity of light in free space to that in the medium. Mathematically expressed as the sine of the angle of incidence divided by the sine of the angle of refraction, when light is traveling from a vacuum (or, as an approximation, air) into the medium. The importance of RI for paint films and lining techniques lies in the fact that the relative transparency or opacity of a paint film depends in part on the difference between the RI of the pigment and that of the suspending medium. A pigment with a high RI (such as titanium dioxide or vermilion) in oil will give an opaque film. Similarly, a pigment of comparatively low RI (such as whiting) will appear opaque in an aqueous medium and transparent in a medium of comparatively higher RI (such as oil). The increasing RI of oil with age increases the transparency of particular oil-pigment mixtures, producing the well-known phenomenon of pentimenti. In lining techniques, it is important not to saturate a low RI ground with a relining adhesive of similar RI because it would reduce the opacity of the ground and lead to a general darkening in tone."

    definition: "Used for testing shear properties of lining adhesives. Two strips of canvas of a given width are overlapped for a certain proportion of their length and joined with the adhesive. The free end of one strip is fixed, and the free end of the other is increasingly weighted until failure of the adhesive occurs. The results are expressed as shear strength and are given in the units of MPa or pounds per square inch (psi). The most common measurement obtained from a shear test is the shear strength, which is the maximum load a material can withstand in a direction parallel to the face of the material, as opposed to perpendicular to its surface. The shear strength is calculated by dividing the force required to shear the specimen by the area of the sheared edge.

  - term: "starch glues"
    definition: "Chemically, starch is a polymer of glucose. It has two constituents: amylose and amylopectin. For the preparation of starch glues, the starch from rice, wheat, corn, or arrowroot is commonly employed. When mixed with water and heated the starch gelatinizes and forms a viscous paste, which is a solution of amylose thickened by jelly-like amylopectin. Because adhesive films encourage mold growth and become brittle with age, humectants and fungicides are common additives. Soluble starch can be prepared from starch by treating it with acid or using various other methods. It dissolves to give a clear solution in hot water and can be used as an alternative size to gelatin."

Linen canvas has served in the past, mainly suiting glue-paste adhesives, having a typical life span of 80–100 years; it has also been used with wax-resin and synthetic-resin adhesives. Woven glass fiber fabric, offering evenness of weave, greater rigidity, and absence of creep, became common in the 1970s and 1980s, but have limited use today. Aluminum sheet or honeycomb sandwich panels have also been used as supporting materials (usually incorporating an interleaf between the original canvas and the backing panel). Woven polyester fabrics are often used and offer a limitless range of properties."

  - term: "thread-by-thread tear mending"
    definition: "A method of repairing tears in a canvas support, by realigning and rejoining individual threads broken by the tear, or adding fibers of similar weight if portions of threads are missing, then reweaving the torn section together. Broken threads are usually butt-jointed with a sturgeon glue/starch paste adhesive. Often tension is introduced to close the tear if it has opened (see *Trekker* entry), although tears are often repaired before any planar distortions are addressed.

  - term: "vacuum envelope"
    definition: "The system has since been applied to the lining of canvas paintings. An envelope of plastic sheeting encloses both the painting and lining support, which are thus held together under vacuum pressure during the lining process. An external heat source and vacuum extraction points may also be incorporated. The method aims to minimize changes in surface texture by allowing the lining canvas and lining surface to conform to the reverse texture of the painting, rather than pressing it through to the paint surface. In this way lining pressure can be balanced, although the degree of tensioning of the lining canvas will affect this. The system allows full observation of both sides of the lining sandwich throughout the process, and rapid heating and cooling. First tested in 1964 in New York for the treatment of paint cleavage on panel paintings."

  - term: "vinyl resins"
    definition: "Thermoplastic synthetic polymers of the general formula (--CH=CH2). Four types of vinyl resins have found use in conservation as adhesives are (1) Ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers: synthetic resins in which the polymer chains contain both ethylene and vinyl acetate monomer units. They are available in a variety of grades of differing molecular weight and vinyl acetate content; these factors govern the strength and solubility properties of the resin. They are generally soluble in less polar solvents than polyvinyl acetate—in aliphatic hydrocarbons or mixtures of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons—and are also available as emulsions. Grades with a vinyl acetate content greater than 25% have been found to exhibit cross linking in aging tests. They are used in solvent-applied heat-seal adhesives. (2) Polyvinyl acetate (PVA) synthetic resin is available in a range of grades of increasing degree of polymerization. Properties include stable to light; no evidence of cross linking; some tendency to swell in water; soluble in aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, and lower alcohols, but insoluble in aliphatic hydrocarbons. Viscosity of solutions, mechanical strength, and softening point (60°C– 200°C) increase with increasing degree of polymerization. PVA has been widely used as an adhesive in conservation in solvent types, heat-seal adhesives, and the well-known emulsion glues. Unlike wax-resin and other adhesives, its low refractive index means it does not appreciably stain porous substrates. (3) Polyvinyl alcohol, a water-soluble synthetic resin. It has good light stability and retains solubility after drying. Weak solutions, but not films, tend to deteriorate and lose cohesion. The degree of hydrolysis and polymerization govern ease of solution and film strength, the latter being also dependent on humidity. Polyvinyl alcohol is a possible component of aqueous lining adhesives but is more often used for paper and textiles and is a common stabilizer for PVA emulsions. (4) Polyvinyl acetals (especially polyvinyl formal and polyvinyl butyral). Thermoplastic synthetic polymers obtained from polyvinyl alcohols by partial reaction with formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and butyraldehyde respectively. They are available in various grades depending on degree of polymerization and polyvinyl alcohol content. They have good stability to light and form tough films varying from rubbery (the butyrals) to hard (the formals). The acetals and butyrals are soluble in aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, and acetone. The formals have limited solubility."
