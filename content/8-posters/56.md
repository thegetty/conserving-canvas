## Introduction

The paper describes a theoretical and practical approach to the remedial conservation of double-sided canvas paintings, cultic flags, and epitaphs on fabric with ritual functions, dating from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in Romania. Double-sided painted flags and banners call back to an ancient archetype, the Constantinian *labarum,* a semantic reconversion of the Roman *vexillum—*the flag of the Roman cavalry—to a symbol of Christianity. Painted cloth artifacts are known from Egyptian antiquity through the medieval period in Europe,[^1] with the *gonfalone,* the heraldic flags of the Renaissance and beyond to banners of ‘professional guilds in Europe. Asian *thangka* paintings are another example.

Double-sided painted textiles have been used since ancient times in the Orthodox Church during processions, ecclesiastic feasts, and litanies. The identity of double-sided painted canvases with ritual function marks a particular chapter of challenges for painting conservators, starting from the cultural perspective and extending to the very specific technical aspects that define such complex objects, defined typologically as paintings on canvas or as painted textiles ([[Pollak 2003]]).

The conservation of such painted banners has rarely been addressed in the literature yet is a subject of interest to conservators of liturgical objects. The *Bibliography of Romanian Vexilology* ([[Mureșan and L-Șt. Szemkovics 2018]]) mentions sixty-nine titles referring to conservation aspects of flags and banners; however, most of the references address textile artifacts and embroideries, rather than painted banners. The Getty Conservation Institute’s online database AATA Online[^2] reveals ninety-eight results over a broad search on the topic. In this study, the technical examination of twenty-five of these banners is used to inform research into consolidant choices for the treatment of these objects.

## Context

This study addresses eighteenth- and nineteenth-century processional ecclesiastic objects painted on canvas supports, double-sided painted banners called *prapori,* and painted epitaphs, originating from wooden churches ([fig. 56.1](#fig-56-1); also see the Appendix). The majority of these objects are stored in the collection of the Orthodox Archdiocese of Timișoara, in the Metropolis of Banat.

In the Christian ecclesiastical space, double-sided painted banners are always stored vertically, hanging from a pole in the narthex or the nave of the church. Banners are mounted on a special designed T-shape suspension pole, which is associated with the holy cross; this pole functionally supports a second horizontal wooden pole, called a *drug,* on which the painted fabric is draped. The wooden poles are attached to the structure of the rows of standing pews along the north and south perimeter aisles of the architectural space, except for once a year, when they are carried in processions. The display as a function of the scenography inherent to the specific moment of the ecclesiastic year induces significant stresses to the canvas due, basically, to the action of gravity and the weight of the canvas itself, leading to deformation and other mechanical damage.

By comparison, painted epitaphs are generally laid horizontally on flat surfaces,

which protects the canvas from many of the mechanical stresses banners are subject to. In both cases, however, the integrity of the painted image, the religious icon, is related to the liturgical presence of the depicted subjects and has to be considered essentially as an argument during strategies for a conservation planning.

## Materials and Technique

Twenty-five different painted liturgical textiles were studied; they are constructed of a variety of materials (see [fig. 56.1](#fig-56-1)). The horizontal wooden top poles are occasionally polychromed and have profiled bulbs mounted on their ends. The textile supports are either a single piece of plain-weave linen or hemp or composed of two different pieces of the same fabric, sewn together along the vertical axis of the banner. In addition, there may be a variety of ornamental accessories such as lappets, fringes, tassels, textile ribbons, and braids. Generally, in case of the banners, the canvas surface is entirely covered with paint. In rare cases in the epitaphs*,* the fabric is only partly painted. Metal leaf is used for gilding halos and the painted frames that structure the composition.

In most examples, with rare exceptions, the canvas supports carry a sizing and/or a ground layer of different thickness and layer structure all over the canvas surface. However, sometimes the ground only covers the rectangle corresponding to the central image of the composition and not the lappets of banners. The layering of paint strata is simple thinly applied on heterogenous ground layers,[^3] using the pigments available at the time, which provided a generally matte surface finish.

Strips of material sewn all around on three of four margins of banners’ perimeter were used as structural reinforcements to protect the regular perforated edges of the fabric; this indicates that the canvas was prestretched. Occasionally, the perimeters are decorated with patterned ribbon or, rarely, fringes of wool. Some of the painted banners carry dyed wool tassels mounted on carved wooden elements that hang from the lappets,[^4] the rectangular, triangular, or rounded bottom panels depending from the banners.

Epitaphs (and less often banners) are painted on satin-weave dyed textiles, and the pattern of the textile is included as an element of texture in relationship with the painted surface of the composition. The painting media are proteinaceous and/or lipidic ([table 56.1](#table-56-1)) and may be associated with similar binder and pigments used to decorate wooden churches of the same period, where primed canvas strips are commonly used to secure the joints between neighboring wooden panels.

## Degradation

The itinerant purpose of painted banners and epitaphs for ecclesiastical display, as well as their technique and constitutive shape, are factors that contribute to their degradation. Mechanical stress and strain develop unevenly within the textile support in conjunction with the horizontal upper suspension pole of banners and their inherent lack of a strainer. The structural presence of heavy lappets cut out from the larger fabric surface also contribute to these stresses. The objects are used outdoors and exposed to severe weather conditions and UV radiation. Inside churches, they are exposed to environmental conditions such as air currents, high fluctuations of ambient parameters, and occasionally direct contact with water. They are also exposed to fatty components and soot from oil lamps, candles, and censers. Handling during rituals, inappropriate storage, transportation, and routine maintenance can all lead to mechanical damage. Biological damage can be caused by birds, bats, and moths and other insects. Technical issues inherent to the paintings’ manufacture include rigid layering, critical or high pigment volume concentration (PVc), chemical alterations due to pigment-media interaction, unstable pigments or dyes, embrittlement of the painting’s strata, loss of adhesion or cohesion due to failure of the binding media within the layers, and other technical issues regarding the painting technique such as structural losses, tears in the fabric, and biochemical degradation of canvas threads.

## Instrumental Analysis

Digital photography and portable handheld digital microscopy with ultraviolet, visible, and infrared spectra illumination were used to document the objects. A consistent number of microsamples was collected for technical examination purposes, generating large quantities of data that is still being studied.

The samples were observed with light microscopy under high magnification with a Zeiss Axio Imager.A1m and Olympus BX51 microscopes, and some samples were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy– energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX)[^5] to provide more in-depth information on the surface of the samples and the presence of various specific elements in different strata. Three banners were inspected using a noninvasive, portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer.[^6] More insight into the samples’ crystalline nature came to light using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) examination. The identity of some pigments and media were confirmed by analysis of the samples using micro-Raman spectroscopy,[^7] the Olympus BX-51 microscope and attenuated total reflectance–Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR-).[^8] Canvas threads were investigated with ATR-FTIR using a portable Alpha spectrometer from Bruker Optics equipped with an ALPHA Platinum ATR module. Spectra were recorded in the 4000–650 cm^−1^ spectral range with a 4 cm^−1^ resolution, using 32 scans ([fig. 56.2](#fig-56-2); see [table 56.2](#table-56-2)). The data from samples of the referred objects were compared with measurements taken on a sample of painted canvas, cloth glued over the face of the joint, from a painted wooden church from Curtea, dated 1806, to confirm that painters of wooden churches used similar materials—canvas and ground layer composition—to paint banners.

## Consolidation Tests

In preparation for future interventions in cases where the degraded canvas carries a heavy load of paint strata on both sides, consolidation tests were performed on canvas, ground, and/or paint layers. Different formulated products were assessed to stabilize flaking paint, improve the strength of the layers and their adhesion to the substrate, and structurally reinforce the weakened canvas. Testing was performed on a surviving fragment of a banner and on a damaged area of a second banner that presented severe craquelure, deformation of the detached paint layers in the interface support ground, cleavage of paint layer from ground, and displaced flakes of paint stratigraphy ([table 56.3](#table-56-3)).

{% figure 'table-56-3' %}

Research on previous consolidation campaigns with similar objects reveal the use of protein glues and carboxymethyl cellulose ([[Dumitran and Rustoiu 2007\|, 30]]). Beva 371b formulations were previously used ([[Petcu 2017]]), but some of the ingredients can raise concerns for conservators. Water-based consolidation systems and adhesives prone to severe shrinkage, as are protein glues, were not considered here, due to the fragility of the untensioned canvas and paint as well as the presence of metal soaps formation.[^9] Potentially cross-linking materials were also excluded from the list.

The properties of the chosen materials were researched with recommendations from the available literature,[^10] and further mixtures were selected, including particular additives. The 11 formulas chosen included polyethyloxazoline (PEOX) solutions, including Aquazol 200 and 500; polyvinyl alcohol (Mowiol 4-88), acrylic solutions as Degalan P 550 and Paraloid B72, nonionic cellulose ethers, such as MC and MHEC, as well as Celluforce NCC cellullose nanocrystals ([[Bridarolli et al. 2018b]]) (see [table 56.3](#table-56-3)). Aquazol was selected given its versatility, nontoxicity, minimal interaction with the constituent materials of paintings, and good reversibility ([[Bosetti 2012]]). To enhance the diffusion of the consolidant and its efficiency, surface cleaning and prewetting was carried out selectively.

Considering the dry environment of current storage, Aquazol 500—stronger than Aquazol 200 ([[Mecklenburg, Fuster-López, and Ottoloni 2012\|, 21]]) but with lower penetration ([[Arslanoglu and Tallent 2003]])—was used instead of protein glues, assuring optimum penetration, plasticization, and the necessary workability to reattach the flakes. The addition of 1% Celluforce NCC helped improving the interlayer adhesion and grip while simultaneously reinforcing the degraded canvas. Culminal 2000, a methylcellulose derivative, was added to impart gelled consistency to the adhesive, decreasing the RH responsiveness ([[Arslanoglu 2004]]) and better performance in filling gaps between shrunken ground and canvas threads. Repeated applications by brush and syringe and both cold mechanical pressure using a silicon tool and the heated spatula proved useful in achieving satisfactory adhesion and a stabilization of canvas and paint on both sides of the banner ([fig. 56.3](#fig-56-3)).

Over time, however, the impact of the weight of the lappets on the overall mechanical behavior of the canvas might further require local reinforcement with an adhesive that provides an additional bonding capacity to the paint layers before further necessary structural interventions can be carried out on the support. Polyamide welding powder was preferred for structural repairs on the heavy lappets, yet interventions were postponed, due to a need for immediate stabilization of the flaking. Previous research has shown that Beva 371 presents good bonding properties[^11] and that the cohesive properties remain fairly stable over a wide range of humidity. This is significantly interesting considering that these artworks are usually stored in uncontrolled environments. Being a thermoplastic adhesive, Beva 371 should also stay flexible in the long term.
