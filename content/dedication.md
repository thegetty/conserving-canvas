Paintings conservator Debra Daly Hartin (1953–2022) died just two weeks after making final edits to her paper in these proceedings. Three years earlier, Debbie pushed herself to prepare her presentation and deliver it in person at the 2019 Yale symposium. For her, it was the opportunity to wrap up her life’s work on linings, knowing there might not be another chance.

Conservation research institutes around the world have long advocated the symbiosis between practitioner and scientist, a feat not easy to accomplish. Debbie made it work, with humility about what she did not know, tenacity about what she did know, and grace during all deliberations. Debbie was truly passionate about understanding linings, building practice through structured research, and passing paintings into their best possible futures. This book is dedicated to her memory.
