<tbody>
<tr>
 <td>Brief description</td>
 <td>A yarn section is manually inserted into the upper clamp using an appropriate clip and fixed in position by closing the lower clamp. For measurement, the sample is stretched with constant deformation speed until break, and the maximum tensile strength and maximum tensile strength elongation are recorded.</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td>Sample</td>
 <td>Yarn section (twisted).</td>

 <tr>
 <td>Sample length</td>
 <td>5.0 mm</td>

 <td>Clamps</td>
 <td>After TAPPI T 231 cm-07.</td>

 <tr>
 <td>Sample preparation</td>
 <td>For samples of original paintings, primer and paint residuals must be excluded and sizing reduced.</td>
