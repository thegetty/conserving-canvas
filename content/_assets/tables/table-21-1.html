  <strong>Mehraâ€™s eight requirements for lining canvas paintings</strong>
</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
 <td>1.</td>
 <td>Whatever the nature of the materials used, they should remain fully reversible with regard to additional relining eventually needed in the future</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td>2.</td>
 <td>Relining* may not in anyway cause alterations in the structural character of a painting</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td>3.</td>
 <td>The materials used should have passed the selection in direct reference to the specific problems of the painting involved</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td>4.</td>
 <td>Flexibility must be guaranteed for an unlimited period of time</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td>5.</td>
 <td>The use of heat should be avoided altogether or must be considerably minimized</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td>6.</td>
 <td>Increase of weight as a result of relining should be minimal</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td>7.</td>
 <td>The adhesive selected should not be allowed to permeate the canvas, ground and paintfilm alike. Instead, it should form only a film between old and new canvases</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td>8.</td>
 <td>It must be optional to use the selected adhesive in different degrees of cohesive strength and it is imperative that it will have proper resistance to fluctuations in temperature and humidity. It should be compatible with the other materials used for the relining which it serves.</td>
 </tr>
