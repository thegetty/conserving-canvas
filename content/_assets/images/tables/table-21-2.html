<tr>
  <td>
    <p><strong>Change in paint properties or structure—due to solvent exposure (including water) or temperature change</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>No risk or very low risk.</li>
      <li>Small risk of subtle change.</li>
      <li>Medium risk of flattening or stiffening the paint due to the use of solvents or temperature.</li>
      <li>High risk of visible flattening areas with impasto and changing paint properties permanently.</li>
      <li>Very high risk of flat impasto or paint loss and permanent change of properties.</li>
    </ol>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <p><strong>Change in canvas properties or structure—due to impregnation of adhesive or moisture/water exposure</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>No change or slight effect of adhesives bonding to surface.</li>
      <li>Slight change due to adhesives penetrating the surface.</li>
      <li>Decrease in strength or changed response to RH due to impregnation.</li>
      <li>Significant brittleness or weakness and/or change in response to RH due to the effect of the adhesive, or risk of shrinkage.</li>
      <li>Serious chemical and/or physical weakening and deformation of canvas due to impregnation with adhesive, or high risk of shrinkage.</li>
    </ol>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <p><strong>Unstable environment (long exposure)—creep due to lack of support</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>No change with change in RH or temperature.</li>
      <li>Risk of increased cracks over 50 years.</li>
      <li>Risk of increased cracks and cupping over 10 years.</li>
      <li>Risk of bulging, cupping, and delamination over 5 years.</li>
      <li>Risk of delamination after 1 year of climate exposure.</li>
    </ol>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <p><strong>Short exposure to forces—lack of support with fast climate events, keying out or restretching</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Support is as stiff as the paint layer—fully supported.</li>
      <li>Support is stiff, but not as stiff as the stiffer paint layers.</li>
      <li>Lining provides some support, but not enough to prevent damage with significant use of force (e.g., keying out in corners).</li>
      <li>Lining provides very little support, and there is risk of cracks and cupping.</li>
      <li>Treatment provides no support, so any slight or significant increase in forces will affect the paint layer directly.</li>
    </ol>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <p><strong>Shear forces between canvas and lining—due to stiffness in lining and shrinkage forces in canvas</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>No forces.</li>
      <li>Slight forces with changes in RH.</li>
      <li>Some shear forces with change in RH in case of canvas contraction.</li>
      <li>Local delamination of lining with change in RH if canvas contracts and the binder is not strong.</li>
      <li>High forces with delamination of lining if canvas contracts and the binder is not strong.</li>
    </ol>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <p><strong>Shear forces between canvas and paint—due to free movement of the canvas and stiffness in paint</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>No forces.</li>
      <li>Slight forces with changes in RH.</li>
      <li>Some forces and risk of long-term development of cracks in paint layer due to compression or tension.</li>
      <li>High forces and risk of cupping and delamination.</li>
      <li>Very high forces and risk of tenting and delamination of paint in high RH situations.</li>
    </ol>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <p><strong>Visual change—due to impregnation and subsequent change of refraction index</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>No change.</li>
      <li>ΔE = below 1: Change cannot be seen with naked eye.</li>
      <li>ΔE = 1: Change is just noticeable.</li>
      <li>ΔE = more than 1: Change is obvious, but the artwork can still be enjoyed.</li>
      <li>Significant change and seriously compromised appreciation of the artwork.</li>
    </ol>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>
    <p><strong>Reversibility—due to materials used or construction of structural treatment</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Easy to remove both canvas and adhesive (if present).</li>
      <li>Can be removed with little effort.</li>
      <li>Canvas is easy to remove while adhesive is more difficult, but low risk for original materials if care is taken.</li>
      <li>Canvas and adhesive can be removed only with some risk of damaging original materials.</li>
      <li>Canvas and adhesive cannot be removed without causing significant damage to the original painting.</li>
