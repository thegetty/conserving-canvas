 <td>The cultural history of secondary additions should be recognized, including additional varnish, retouches, lining canvas, and stretcher. Such materials or items should only be removed or replaced in case they deteriorate or change the original structure or the appearance. If need be removed, they ought to be registered and preferably kept elsewhere.</td>
