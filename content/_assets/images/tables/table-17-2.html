  <p>Note: Each ingredient is identified by the presence of specific compounds at a particular molecular weight (m/z). GC/MSD seemed to have difficulty detecting microcrystalline wax (particularly when beeswax was present in the recipe) as well as the proprietary resins Zonarez B-85 and Piccolyte S-85 (not listed in table).</p>
