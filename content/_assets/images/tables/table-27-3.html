  <td><strong>Advantages</strong></td>

    <ul>
      <li>Powder (CNC) or paste form (CNF and CCNF); dispersions in water or water + ethanol (50:50)</li>
      <li><strong>Mode of application</strong>: Spraying, brushing or blade coating</li>
      <li>Superficial treatment layer (“nanolining”)</li>
      <li><strong>Reinforcement</strong> provided at low weight added (3%)</li>
      <li>No color or gloss change on jute, linen, or cotton canvases</li>
    </ul>
  </td>
  <td>
    <ul>
      <li>Aqueous and heptane-based solutions (viscous liquid at 2% w/w, gel)</li>
      <li><strong>Mode of application</strong>: Brushing or blade coating, spraying (only for aqueous treatment highly diluted)</li>
      <li><strong>Bulk penetration</strong> (aqueous treatment) and <strong>surface deposition </strong> (heptane treatment)</li>
      <li><strong>Better control </strong> over solvent penetration</li>
      <li><strong>Reinforcement</strong> provided at low weight added (2%) (lower than nanocellulose-only)</li>
      <li>Possible combined strategy: consolidation and deacidification</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Aqueous or water +<sub></sub>ethanol (50:50) dispersions</li>
      <li><strong>Mode of application</strong>: spraying (preferred) or brushing</li>
      <li><strong>Bulk penetration </strong> if used at low concentration (&amp;lt;4.5% w/w)</li>
      <li><strong>Reinforcement</strong> provided at low weight added (8.6%); higher reinforcement but lower elongation at break and breaking force than CNF-treated sample when tested on a modern degraded cotton canvas</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Amount of water introduced by using aqueous-based treatments can be reduced by spraying</li>
      <li>Change of gloss and whitening of dark canvases (in particular when deacidification agent MgO added)</li>
      <li>Lower mechanical response to RH than CNF, CCNF treatments; similar to lower response than untreated was measured (20%–60% RH and 20%–80% RH cycles)</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Amount of water introduced during treatment can be reduced by spraying</li>
      <li>Multiscale consolidation (bulk and surface) by combining treatment with CNF (mixed in solution)</li>
      <li>Low reinforcement measured on a historical lining linen canvas (to be further investigated)</li>
      <li>Mechanical response to RH variations to be measured</li>
